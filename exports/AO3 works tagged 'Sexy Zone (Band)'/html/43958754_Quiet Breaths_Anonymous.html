    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Kento could not recall how he got into this position.</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t even matter how he got into said position, Fuma sucking at his neck hungrily felt <em>too</em> good and he did not want him to stop anytime soon.</p><p> </p><p>Kento groaned low when Fuma reached down to hold his hip firmly, Kento’s grip tightening on the back of Fuma’s plain white shirt. Kento was careful with the volume level of his noises- he knew his other members would probably hear him in the next hotel room over if he were too loud. Fuma was just making it so annoyingly hard to keep calm.</p><p> </p><p>Fuma pulled away from Kento’s neck, a string of saliva connecting the new hickey invading Kento’s neck and Fuma’s glossy, red lips. He scanned Kento’s neck before looking up at him with an expression that Kento could not read. Kento stared at him with want.</p><p> </p><p>A violent shiver shot up Kento’s spine when the hand that Fuma was using to grasp Kento’s hip ran up his body. The cold fingertips brushed his shirtless side before making it up to Kento’s new hickey. It traced the bite marks littering the once pure throat. Fuma’s hand slid up Kento’s chin, Fuma’s thumb pushing through Kento’s parted lips. The cold metal of Fuma’s thumb ring clicked against Kento’s teeth and laid against Kento’s full lips.</p><p> </p><p>Fuma smiled. Kento moaned quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Fuma’s thumb left Kento’s mouth, his lips staying apart as he waited for Fuma’s next move. The hand moved to cup his cheek, and then to softly move jet black strands away from Kento’s forehead.</p><p> </p><p>Kento wasn’t prepared to hold back the loud whimper that came with Fuma pulling his locks all of a sudden. </p><p> </p><p>Fuma laughed and twirled Kento’s hair between his fingers. He opened his mouth to say something, cut off by a bang of the door opening.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Kento’s eyes shot open. His heart beat fast against his ribcage and he was drenched with sweat. He turned over on his back and sat up.</p><p> </p><p>Fuma was in his own bed, asleep. His broad back was facing Kento. Kento raised a sweaty hand to his neck- no bite marks and no wetness of the other man’s saliva remained. The only evidence left from the scene was an aching tent in Kento’s sweatpants.</p><p> </p><p>By how real everything felt- Fuma’s hands, his mouth, his sensual look- Kento was surprised his mind came up with such an intense dream. Plus, he was surprised at the fact his brain thought now was a good time to put him through… that. The last time Kento had a dream like that about Fuma was after they had drunkenly made out years back. Since then, the other party in Kento’s rare wet dreams had always been a forgotten face of a fictional one-night stand. </p><p> </p><p>With what strength he had left to muster, Kento moved the heavy comforter from the hotel bed and got up. He walked to the bathroom as quietly as humanly possible and let out a deep sigh once the door was clicked closed behind him. </p><p> </p><p>Kento turned on the vanity lights and gave his tired eyes a second to adjust to the disturbance. No hickey on his neck. No bite marks, no nothing. Just a hard-on staring back at him in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>Kento groaned and turned on the sink to rinse off his sweaty face. Fuma got nowhere near his dick in his imagination yet he’s incredibly worked up. Maybe he was just sex deprived. </p><p> </p><p>He peeled off the black shirt stuck to his back and threw it in his dirty pile of clothes in the corner, deciding to go shirtless back to sleep. Kento turned the water off and made his trek back to his own bed, hoping that his erection will calm down once he lays down and gets his mind off the man he’s sharing a room with. </p><p> </p><p>Kento climbed back under the comforter and stared up at the ceiling. The annoying light on the smoke detector blinked red in his peripheral as he focused on the hum of the air conditioner. He was feeling a little less sweaty and hot, but just the same amount as bothered as when he woke up.</p><p> </p><p>Kento was struggling not to think about the way Fuma’s lips felt against his neck. The way Fuma caressed his cheek and then pulled his hair, laughing at Kento’s reaction. The hold Fuma had on his hip and the way their bodies fit like a perfect puzzle. </p><p> </p><p>If Kento’s erection was bad before, it was much worse now.</p><p> </p><p>Chills ran down Kento’s spine from just the fabric of what he was wearing brushing against him. His shaky breaths failed to steady as he closed his eyes. He opened them back up quickly and looked to Fuma, who was just quietly sleeping with his back still to Kento. So blissfully unaware of Kento’s lust. Kento had never needed someone so much in his life as he does right now.</p><p> </p><p>Kento’s eyes stayed locked on Fuma’s back on the other bed as he slowly brushed his own hand down his bare chest. He hesitated before getting to the waistband of his sweats, running his fingertips over the sweatpants and teasing his erection. Kento’s eyes fluttered shut and he squirmed under his own touch, sighing as he lifted the waistband of his sweats. He hurriedly shoved his hand in between the soft fabric and his boxers. If Kento was really going to do this, he needed to do it quickly and get back to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>He looked back up at the ceiling and bit his lip, slowly jerking himself off under the covers. Kento’s labored breaths came heavy as he gripped onto his own pants.</p><p> </p><p>He thought of the Fuma in his dream, the way he knew exactly how to make Kento feel good. Kento sped up the pace of his hand and his breath got heavier.</p><p> </p><p>“Kento.”</p><p> </p><p>Kento froze in place, his hand tight around his cock and his lip between his teeth. Fuma saying Kento’s name in such a tired voice did not quite help his predicament, though.</p><p> </p><p>Kento stayed as still as he could possibly manage. He didn’t realize how loud his struggle was or he would not have touched himself like this in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>“Kento.” Fuma repeated in that same sleep-hungry voice.</p><p> </p><p>Kento stayed quiet again, not responding to the man in the other bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you touching yourself?"</p><p> </p><p>Kento swallowed hard and released his bruised lip from between his teeth. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Kento’s voice was quiet, but so obviously shaky. He could feel his cock twitch from gripping it in his hand, not daring to let it go and move under the covers. Kento had not a clue if Fuma’s eyes were on him.</p><p> </p><p>There was a heavy silence in the room. Kento slowly turned his head and Fuma was sitting up. His elbow was propping him up as he faced Kento. Kento could not see the expression on his face in the dark room.</p><p> </p><p>“You woke me up when you went to the bathroom. Are you touching yourself?” Fuma answered a question Kento did not even think to ask and left Kento with one to answer. Kento pulled the covers up further.</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Kento said as confidently as he could. It wasn’t confident enough to quite convince Fuma, and Fuma couldn’t decide if the deciding factor was the whine in Kento’s voice or the desperation. Fuma made a noise that sounded a little like a breathy laugh to Kento.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright.” Kento watched as Fuma turned back over and got comfortable under the covers again. The room was back to the quiet hum of the air conditioning and people loudly talking from floors above.</p><p> </p><p>Kento released a breath he didn’t know he was holding, and with that releasing his erection from his hand. Though he was still painfully hard, it was not worth waking up Fuma with whimpers and moans that Kento thinks are quiet enough. Kento took out his hand from his pants and fluffed up his pillow, turning over and laying on his side away from Fuma.</p><p> </p><p>His mind was left racing as Kento sat there, trying to offer his body to sleep. How much had Fuma figured out? Did he know and just brush it off? Did Kento ACTUALLY seem convincing given the situation he was in?</p><p> </p><p>As Kento went to turn over in bed, a weight landed on his hip bone. Kento jumped and turned his head. <em>Fuma</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not an idiot.” Fuma said in that sleepy, sultry-like voice Kento came to enjoy greatly. Fuma’s hand laid on Kento’s hip just like his dream. <em>Shit</em>. There was no saving him now.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” is all Kento managed to get out before covering his mouth. Fuma’s hand had already darted to the tent in Kento’s sweatpants that had failed to calm down since Kento had woken up earlier. The weight on Kento’s bed shifted as Fuma climbed in behind him, his hand still resting on Kento’s clothed erection. Fuma pushed up against him to spoon him. Fuma used his other arm under Kento to hold him tight, Kento liking the feel of a strong arm supporting his waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Just be quiet. I’ll help you.” Fuma whispered into his ear and Kento melted into his arms, going crazy over the way Fuma’s hand played with his bulge teasingly.</p><p> </p><p>Kento let out a heavy sigh once Fuma pulled away, pulling down the waistband of Kento’s sweatpants and boxers at the same time. Kento closed his eyes once his sensitive cock finally sprung out, hitting the cold air. Fuma’s fingertips were cold against the tip of his erection, Fuma running his index finger down Kento’s length slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Hurry.” Kento choked out and gripped onto the sheets of the bed. His legs were starting to shake and he could feel himself getting closer to finishing from the simple touches.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you like this teasing.” Fuma hummed into Kento’s ear. Fuma took the shell of Kento’s ear and nibbled at it before pulling away and adding “Just relax”. Fuma kissed the nape of Kento’s neck. </p><p> </p><p>Kento felt himself get pulled closer to Fuma’s body by his waist. He felt incredibly small between not being in power and being spooned. Kento choked out once Fuma started pumping him slowly, being sure to rub his thumb against Kento’s tip, slickened with pre-cum. He could feel the cold metal of Fuma’s thumb ring against his cock, similar to the feeling of it on Kento’s lips in his dream</p><p> </p><p>“Fuma-” Kento moaned out with desperation. A quiet laugh blessed Kento’s ears as Fuma jerked him off faster than before. “I’m- hah…” Kento gripped onto his white sheets tighter. His back arched against Fuma’s chest as he tried to hold off his orgasm as long as he could.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so worked up.” Fuma went back to biting the shell of Kento’s ear after leaving little marks on his upper back with his mouth. “You must be so helpless when I’m not here to help you.”</p><p> </p><p>That sentence from Fuma caught Kento completely off guard, moaning at the thought of Fuma doing this more than once with Kento. He whined loud as he came.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” was all Fuma hummed into Kento’s ear. Fuma sped up the motion of his hand, using Kento’s cum as an easy lubricant. Kento was embarrassed at finishing so quickly, but his own hand and mind contributed to it in the end as well. </p><p> </p><p>Kento’s breath heaved out in heavy pants as Fuma pulled away from Kento’s cock. He kissed Kento’s nape once more before sitting up.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait.” Kento managed to breath out. His voice was worn out from pleading breaths and from needy whines. Fuma smiled at that.</p><p> </p><p>“Stay. Here in my bed, I mean.” Kento didn’t look at Fuma, still trying to regain his composure. </p><p> </p><p>Fuma laughed. “I was going to get up to clean you up.” He stood up. “I’ll come back.” Fuma walked to the bathroom. Kento watched him walk to the bathroom to grab a warm towel, to return with love and care.</p><p> </p><p>Stupid dream, making Kento horny for Fuma of all people.</p><p> </p><p>Well. Maybe not <em>that</em> stupid.</p>
