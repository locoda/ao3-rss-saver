      <p><em>“Ah, mou,”</em> Kento thought to himself as the director yelled “Cut!” for what seemed to be the millionth time.</p><p><em>“I want to go back home,”</em> he thought. Not back to the hotel where he stayed, but back to Japan, back where his close friends and family were. The days were long on set and it seemed so busy. Sure, Kento was used to the busyness, but only with himself. He still needed time to adjust to life outside Japan, but his busy schedule made little time for that. He was glad to be working in Europe for some time since it was a new opportunity but he just missed home. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>The day finally ended after so long and he was able to plunge face-first into the pillows in his hotel room. He had no strength to lift his phone and check his notifications. He stayed like that for a few minutes before passing out. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>The sound of the alarm blared through the room as another probably rough morning came for Kento. He felt incredibly tired still, despite having fallen asleep quickly. He got up from his bed and sleepily headed to the bathroom to take a morning shower. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>He arrived on set, thankfully on time. He brought out his script and began reading and came across the word wallet. </p><p><em>“Wallet?”</em> He thought. “<em>Wait.</em>” He patted his pockets, only to find his phone there. He checked his bag and there was no wallet in it. An expression of shock plastered over his face horrified that he had lost something important. His wallet had his money, his IDs and cards, and other shenanigans he decided to put in there.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” the director asked. </p><p>Kento looked up and nodded, “Yeah, I’m okay.”</p><p>“You sure?” he asked. “You were just reading your script and then your expression changed. Did something pop into your head?”</p><p>“No, it’s nothing.” Kento smiled. “Please don’t worry.”</p><p>“Well, if you say so then.”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Filming began and Kento tried his best not to think about his missing wallet. He tried to concentrate as much as he could during his scenes. The director yells “Cut!” and Kento sighed. Finally, it was time for lunch.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>He decided to use his lunch break to sneak off and try looking for his wallet but to no avail. He returned, slightly disappointed but didn’t let it show. Filming eventually wrapped up and he returned to his hotel room feeling extra stressed. He looked at his phone and messaged the Sexy Zone group chat. </p><p>He typed in “Guys, I lost my wallet today.” Shori quickly replied with a “You WHAT?” Kento laughed, not expecting much of a big reaction from Shori.</p><p>Fuma had replied, “Do you know where you lost it?” and Kento quickly typed in “No.”</p><p>So had come online as well. He replied, “I hope you find it soon!”</p><p>Now, everyone was active when Marius asked, “Have you been taking care of yourself, Kento-kun?”</p><p>“Yup, a little stressed than usual but I’m fine. Europe is fun.” he typed. “I’m pretty homesick at the moment but I think I can manage.”</p><p>“We miss you too &lt;3,” Shori replied.</p><p>“Hope you can get home soon and let’s all have fun and drink together!” Fuma replied. Kento laughed in his room at Fuma’s antics.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>He turned off his phone and hopped into the shower, hoping to remove the fatigue. He flopped on his bed and tried his best to sleep peacefully. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>The next morning was not any better than the previous one.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Kento was still caught up in his lost wallet that he couldn’t focus at all. he stared at the papers on his lap but nothing was coming inside of his head. He sat in silence, trying to empty his head. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Filming started for the day and the moment the director yelled “Cut!”, a staff member approached him. A loud voice began speaking in somewhat broken English to the staff.</p><p>“I want to see Nakajima!” the voice said. “I’m give… wallet. I’m… Sexy Zone member Fu—.”</p><p>“Huh?” A staff member replied to them.</p><p>The director looked at Kento who then ran over to the commotion.</p><p>“Please excuse me~,” Kento said to the staff who were blocking the way.</p><p>“I want to see Nakajima please!” Kento finally made his way to the front. </p><p>“Fuma?” he asked, “…and Marius?”</p><p>“Fuma-kun, we told you to stop already!” A whining voice arrived. “Aren’t you bothering them?”</p><p>“Shori?” Kento rubbed his eyes. “So? What are you all doing here?” He turned to the many staff looking at them in English. “I just wrapped up my last scene for today right?” They all nodded.</p><p>“Would it be okay if I left early? I need to talk with these guys.”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” the director replied. “Have fun.”</p><p>“Thank you.” He grabbed his bag and bowed. “Great work today~”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>“So,” Kento placed his hands on top of the table of a restaurant they had found, with the four other members deciding to sit together cramped opposite of Kento, “what are you all doing here in Europe, out of all places?”</p><p>“Your wallet,” Fuma half-joked. He placed it on the table. </p><p>“How did you find my wallet?”</p><p>“You dropped it outside the hotel. We were all planning to surprise you on set by following you secretly and then going the next day. But we found your wallet. So, we found a reason to go look for you.”</p><p>“No, actually,” Marius butted in, “you kept on complaining in the group chat about how homesick you were, so we thought, why not bring the home to you?” </p><p>“So… we brought this.” Shori placed the bag he had been holding on the table. Kento opened it and found a bento box, along with several other Japanese foods. </p><p>“Eh? What’s this?” he pulled the items out. “Is this what you meant by home?”</p><p>“Maybe? You can consider us coming here as home too,” So replied shyly. </p><p>“Aw, So-chan,” Kento cooed. “You guys are so sweet.”</p><p>“We love you, big bro,” Marius added. </p><p>“Come here,” Kento stretched out his arms as he stood up. Everyone went in for a hug. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Kento no longer felt homesick, the home he loved was in his arms and he wasn’t letting go any time soon. </p><p class="p1">
