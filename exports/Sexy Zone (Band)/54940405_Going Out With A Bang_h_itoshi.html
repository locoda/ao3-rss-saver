<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi. So uhm. Yeah. Without starting to pour my heart out in an orgy fic note I want to say that I LOVE this group, I love everyone and they love each other and I cried SO MUCH this past weekend with the last live and Kento leaving (when he couldn't even talk to Fuma I mean, ugh TEARS).</p><p>So I had to do something to deal with my feelings, and since I can only do that through creating porn since I'm too fragile for anything else, I got my shit together and modified and finished the OT5 fic I've been working on since probably 2018. So many hands, so much porn. At least everyone is legal now, thank god. They're all kind of sluts and also a little bit established but I couldn't help myself. Since I probably won't write much more of them now I figured I could just do what the hell I wanted.</p><p>And with that. Goodbye sexy zone, it's been a damn good run.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="toc-heading">Going Out With A Bang</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The silence that follows Marius' words is probably the most tense silence Sou's ever experienced. Even after all these years, he's still amazed at Marius' ability to speak a sentence that no one else would take in their mouth and still not feel bothered by it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou glances around, at the shocked expressions around the table in the private room, then he looks at Marius, at his tilted head and expectant expression as he awaits the judgement. But there's not a smidgen of shame in his posture and Sou admires him so much for that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... What?” Kento finally asks, breaking the silence and Sou looks more closely at the older three, seeing Kento frown like he's certain he heard wrong. Fuma just stares at Marius, for once speechless as his lips part and then close again, and Shori is frozen with his margarita glass halfway to his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked if you want to have sex,” Marius repeats, smiling mischievously and he's definitely grown up a lot during his short time in Europe. Sou doesn't even want to know what he's been doing over there, but it's clearly not innocent. “Letting the group go out with a bang, if you know what I mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I... all of us?” Shori speaks up, the margarita ending up on the table again as he looks a little shaken, glancing around him hesitantly, but he doesn't seem as opposed as Sou would have expected. God bless tequila.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhm,” Marius confirms, smiling cutely and looking at each of them in turn like he just suggested they go for coffee. Sou feels a burst of heat in his stomach when those dark eyes meet his. “Haven't any of you ever thought about sleeping with someone in the group?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question is coaxing, soft, and Shori visibly wets his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou definitely has. Marius knows he has, from those times they messed around when they were younger, when Marius managed to empty his head and his heart of all their secrets just by smiling sweetly. It was never serious between them, but they tried a hell of a lot of things together. Some more successful than others, but dirty talk was definitely a hit with Marius.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The topic of other members first surfaced after a concert where Kento was so close to Sou, touched him more or less inappropriately and Sou couldn't help reacting, the blush on his skin feverish afterwards, and Marius noticed. The scene plays vividly before his inner eye, Marius pinning him down to a hotel bed with dark eyes and a devilish smile, making him talk about what he'd want to do to Kento if he ever could. Sou's cheeks were burning in shame and arousal as he confessed how he just wanted to lick the sweat off Kento's skin, touch him everywhere and make him moan, and the darkness in Marius' eyes sparked as he confessed that he used to fantasize about Fuma and Kento together. And so they started playfully talking about what they'd do if they could ever sleep with their group mates, a returning game of dirty ideas that ended in scorching orgasms and an ashamed blush the following day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But he never thought Marius would try and make it a reality. Still, there's something about the atmosphere tonight, late after their last live together as the five of them, or even as four. The last night of them being Sexy Zone. There's been so many emotions floating around, all of them crying, reminiscing about what's been good and wondering where they're all heading. It feels like there's already been a hurricane in Sou's chest tonight, and he only has the energy to feel like he's happy right in this moment with these amazing and gorgeous men around him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is probably the only night Marius' suggestion might hit home, and Sou silently wishes that it will.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had a wet dream about Fuma once?” Shori finally confesses, and everyone turns to him with stunned expressions. Fuma's mouth falls open initially, but then forms into a flattered smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“... Why not about me?” Kento frowns at Shori, obviously a little hurt, but all Sou can register is how flawless his sharp jawline is, how soft the hair falling against his skin is and now he hopes so badly that this idea will be accepted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He might have had the hots for Kento longer than he wants to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma just chuckles as Shori gives Kento a look that plainly says “really?”.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about the rest of you?” Marius asks, glancing around curiously before he looks straight at Sou with dark knowing in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I have,” Sou tells him, but Marius just grins and nods towards the others, because they don't.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He does?” Shori asks, frowning a little, but his eyes are interested.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We used to...” Sou starts, looking at Marius for confirmation, who just shrugs like he couldn't care less. “We used to hook up and fantasize about the rest of you. It was hot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did!?” Kento asks, eyes wide. He's a little drunk, some residue of eyeliner still applied, and he's so pretty Sou wants to claw his eyes out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” he smiles, a little embarrassed, but he's not going to be worse than Marius. “Mostly about you and Fuma together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento and Fuma immediately glance at each other, but then quickly look away as their eyes meet, and if that isn't a blush on Fuma's cheeks Sou doesn't know what it is. He doesn't know what it means, if they've been thinking about each other as well or if there’s been more than fantasies. He's dying to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hot,” Marius comments unashamedly at their awkward exchange of looks, and Fuma looks up, opening his mouth to scold him, but Shori speaks up behind the rim of his margarita.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” he simply agrees, and Fuma turns to him instead, the look of confusion making Shori shrug like it can't be helped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nobody's dating anyone right now anyway, are they?” Marius goes on, smile widening and tone silky as he clearly knows he's winning this argument, if there ever was one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori opens his mouth but then closes it again, straightening up and he looks a little uncomfortable, which Marius immediately picks up on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh? Really?” he asks, and Sou's torn between being interested and a little panicked that Shori might end this idea right here and now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, we're not... We've just...” Shori starts, then breathes a sigh through his nose, the blush on his cheeks hot pink and super attractive. “Anyway, he wouldn't mind if it was my group.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>he</span>
</em>
<span>,” Marius repeats, sounding approving and suggestive at the same time, but then wets his lips and smiles. “So are we leaving then? I have a suite in a hotel nearby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A </span>
<em>
<span>suite</span>
</em>
<span>?” Fuma repeats, can't help himself. “Don't you have a place to stay here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Marius agrees, coyly. “But I thought, you know, just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma gapes at him, instinctively looking at Kento for support and finding it in Kento's incredulous look, their previous tense moment clearly forgotten. “You've been planning this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius just smiles and starts getting up from his chair. “Are you coming or what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou rises to follow him, feeling a little awkward as he glances around, but then Shori downs the rest of his margarita and stands as well, a cute smile on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not,” he says, and Kento sighs but starts getting up as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay,” Fuma agrees, still looking a little stunned as he starts to reach for his jacket, clearly feeling a little weird about being the last to agree to anything sexual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It is a little surprising, but also really appealing, Sou thinks as he watches Fuma shrug into his jacket, a fluttering feeling spreading in his body at the prospect of this actually happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's not far to Marius' hotel, and his smile as he holds the door to the suite open for them is genuine and not nervous at all. Sou's the last to enter, and he slips up close to him, closer than he has to but it feels good and Marius smells nice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you plan this?” he asks, and Marius laughs softly, leaning in to kiss Sou's forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was going to pull the birthday card if they didn't agree,” he admits, keeping his voice down and Sou smiles. “I knew you would be up for it but I was worried about the rest. Mostly Shori.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both turn to watch the older three looking around the rooms the size of an apartment, at Shori's bright eyes as he points out fancy gadgets while Fuma loudly calls it extravagant and showy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess I didn't have to be,” Marius goes on, and Sou instinctively reaches out for him, brushing his fingers against his side. “Now let's make some wet dreams come true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou laughs at that, loud enough to catch the others attention, and Fuma frowns as he starts shrugging out of his jacket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you two doing over there?” he asks suspiciously, and Marius puts on his flirtiest smile at him but says nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, it's a little weird when you do that,” Fuma tells him, carelessly tossing his jacket over a chair. “You're still like my little brother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He hasn't been little in a while though, has he?” Kento speaks up, reaching past Fuma to add his jacket to the pile, and Fuma can't seem to think of anything else to say, following Kento's retreat with his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're right about that,” Marius agrees with a laugh, hinting at his height, and Sou smiles. “Anyone want something else to drink? Or should we just get to the fun part?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence settles in the room at the last part, all of them seeming to tense at the idea of actually touching each other. Kento crosses his arms and looks over at Fuma's back, Fuma does his best to not look at Kento, and Sou is suddenly so filled up with adrenaline he doesn't know what to do with himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, tipsy Shori is much more daring than sober Shori, and Sou watches in fascination as he sits down on the edge of the massive bed, bouncing a little with a small, expectant smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius looks around at the others, clearly finding them hesitant, so he just walks over to the bed and sits down next to Shori.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Marius smiles cutely as he settles on the bed, sliding up further onto the covers and draws his legs up under him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Shori replies, the laughter obvious in his voice, and however Sou imagined this to start, he never expected it to be so light hearted. But he’s glad it is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It feels like slow motion when Marius leans in to cup Shori's face, easily tilting it towards him, and brings their smiles together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smiles slowly fade as the chaste first kiss becomes a longer, more lingering one, as lips part against each other and breaths slip out. Sou bites his lip as he stares unashamedly, because he's never seen Marius kiss anyone else and he's never seen Shori kiss anyone at all. Shori's eyelashes are so long against his cheeks, the beauty of his face somehow enhanced as he kisses back like they're in some classy erotic movie. Marius' hand cupping Shori's face slips into his hair, combing through it and teasingly pulling a little until Shori gasps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the first flash of tongue, Sou feels an uncomfortable jolt of heat hitting him right in his stomach, and the arousal starts to overtake the adrenaline. He wets his lips as he keeps watching, watches how Marius' long fingers grasp the front of Shori's T-shirt and pulls him along as he leans back, making Shori crawl on top of him. Marius looks good against the sheets, he already knows that much, but it becomes even more obvious when there's someone else above him, his dark hair fanning out over the covers and his back arching the slightest as Shori does something particularly good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori's hair falls against Marius' forehead as they keep kissing, holding himself up by his elbows and straddling one of Marius's thighs as he stays up on his knees. He's wearing an old pair of jeans that cling sinfully to his ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou barely has time to finish that thought before Marius' hands run down Shori's sides, fingertips lingering a little at the strip of bared skin between his jeans and T-shirt, before slipping around to firmly cup Shori's butt. He squeezes a little, making a noise very similar to a groan pass Shori's lips, and Sou's had it, the erection in his own pants growing way too rapidly for him to just stand here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tears his eyes away in order to look to the side, finding Kento just next to him watching the unexpected couple on the bed with a sparkle of interest in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just fucking kiss me,” Sou demands, and Kento blinks once before turning to properly look at him with hooded eyes, clearly taking in the state he's already in as he glances down Sou's body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tiny smirk tugs at Kento's lips before he steps forward, and Sou's heartbeat immediately picks up as he realizes that Kento's actually going to kiss him. Not pretend like he does on stage, not come close and pull back with a smile. Actually kiss him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He feels himself blushing and he doesn't even know why, but he glances over Kento's shoulder for a second to see Fuma watching him with dark eyes, uncertain what emotion is behind them, and he can't help the heat flooding his cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento has to feel it, since he cups Sou's face with both hands, and Sou's never reacted so violently to a touch before. A shudder runs through his entire body just as Kento's lips touch his own, and Sou actually moans, hands reaching out to grasp what he can because </span>
<em>
<span>yes</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He feels Kento's smile against his lips, and he knows he comes off desperate but he doesn't want to admit for how long he's wondered what Kento's kisses would feel like. Soft, but hot, is his conclusion, because there's no force or urgency, just soft, unhurried kisses that somehow manage to have the same heat behind them that Kento's eyes can have, and Sou finds himself craving so much more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He's surprised as he's pushed backwards, but he doesn't mind because his knees won't hold out for much longer anyway. He falls back against the mattress and bounces a little, Kento crawling after him and covering Sou's body with his own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It feels so good, Kento's weight on top of him and his scent all around him, and Sou moans as his erection brushes against Kento's hip. His sound earns him a shift above him, and then the gentle request to deepen the kiss as the heat of tongue brushes against his lower lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou couldn't part his lips faster, almost attacking Kento's mouth in his eagerness to get a deeper kiss. Once again he feels Kento smile against his lips before indulging him, but Sou doesn't even feel embarrassed about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He vaguely hears Marius' “oh fuck” and his eyes start to flutter open reflexively even before Kento ends the kiss. He glances up to the direction of Marius and Shori, and another jolt of heat hits him as he meets Marius' dark eyes watching him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their eye contact breaks as Kento's lips touch Sou's neck, the soft, warm touch sending tingles over his skin, and Marius' eyes avert as the bed dips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou tilts his head to see Fuma hesitantly sitting down on the opposite edge of the bed, his eyes lingering on what Kento's busy doing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes</span>
</em>
<span>,” Marius breathes, and Sou looks up again to see him detangle himself from Shori, who sits up and pulls back a little with a curious expression and flushed cheeks, before he starts on Fuma.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou decidedly gets a hand in Kento's hair and pulls, the little gasp against his neck making goosebumps break out on his skin and he wants him back there, but he feels like Kento should watch this too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma looks apprehensive as Marius crawls straight into his lap, as close as he dares and Sou's hand in Kento's hair tightens involuntarily because he sees how desperate Marius' eyes are. Knows how much Marius has wanted Fuma in the past and he's not exactly grown less hot since them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please?” Marius begs quietly, and a muscle in Fuma's face twitches a little before he gives the tiniest little nod.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento's lips brush against Sou's collarbones more absently than not, but it still causes him to shiver violently as Marius gently tilts Fuma's head up with fingers under his chin, a shaky sigh coming over Marius' lips as he leans in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma stays completely still as Marius presses their lips together, softly and carefully, the lack of response passive rather than unwilling, his hands settling on Marius' thighs and resting there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou can see just how much Marius is holding back, how much he wants to do and it's so fucking hot, especially when Fuma finally parts his lips on a soft sigh and tilts his head to meet Marius' movement, clearly deciding it’s okay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The change in Marius is obvious, the eagerness showing as he pushes closer, straddling Fuma's lap and visibly flicks his tongue against Fuma's lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou feels the response in Kento too; the second Fuma starts kissing back his lips fall still against Sou's collarbone and there's a slow, almost reflexive roll of his hips against Sou's just for a little more friction. Sou shifts to accommodate, ready to spread his legs and ask Kento to fuck him senseless when Kento pulls back, sits up and Sou's confused until he feels a hand on his shoulder, curious fingertips touching the bare skin just above his neckline. He's so sensitive he shivers, tearing his eyes from Marius' trying to eat Fuma whole to glance up at Shori, with flushed cheeks and mischievous eyes. He always thought Shori was hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou sits up slowly, and Shori easily slides in behind him, pressing a hot kiss against his temple and Sou arches against his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He watches Kento smile at his expression, hot and promising and Sou's eyes roll back into his head when Kento's hands slip under the hem of his shirt while Shori's fingers sneak around to his belt buckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He feels overwhelmed and breathless as his skin starts being exposed, mindlessly raising his arms to let Kento tug the garment over his head, his messy hair falling back down on Shori's cheek as Shori keeps pressing wet kisses against his hairline and cheekbone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento leans in to kiss his neck again, purposely working his way up his jaw to meet Shori's lips there, and Sou's breath comes out shallow as he turns as well as he can to watch them kiss over his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The wet sounds of lips sliding against each other is right in his ear and he sees Shori's teeth catch on Kento's thick lower lip, his erection twitching madly in his pants and he arches up against Shori's insanely slow fingers at his belt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He blindly reaches out for Kento's clothes, twisting his fingers in his shirt to release some tension, inhaling Kento's cologne and he considers just ripping the fabric off Kento's body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then there's a wet moan between a sucking noise right in his ear, fingertips slipping under the waistband of his boxers and Sou arches with a moan into the gentle touch slowly encircling his erection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It makes the kiss break over his shoulder, and Sou leans back on Shori's shoulder while Kento tilts his head to return to Sou’s neck, gentle bites that slowly lower onto his chest threatening to undo him already.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He makes an entirely savage noise when Kento licks his stiff nipple while running his hot palms over Sou's inner thighs, and a thrust from behind him pushes an impressive erection against his smaller back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>Shori</span>
</em>
<span>,” Sou gets out, because he's packing a monster. Shori's dick has been a topic of discussion before, because it's a considerable size that Shori's somehow extremely embarrassed of, but Sou's never seen it hard before. Definitely not felt it. “You need to put that inside of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori moans faintly and thrusts up again, and Sou instinctively tugs at Kento because there's something else he needs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I want your fingers,” he demands, because he needs them, he really really needs Kento's fingers inside of him. He's dreamed about them since he was fifteen and saw Kento play the piano up close, shamefully wondering what those fingers could do with his insides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn, okay,” Kento agrees, lifting his head from Sou's chest, his pupils blown wide and bangs in his eyes and he's so gorgeous Sou wants to shake him. He almost wants to say he'll take both their dicks, but with Shori's being what it is, that won’t be possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento sits back and Shori starts shoving Sou's pants and underwear off, Sou trying to control his limbs enough to be helpful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mari, we're gonna need some lube,” Kento says, voice low, and Sou glances over because he almost forgot about Marius and Fuma even being here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His hips jerk involuntarily when he looks over, Marius topless on his back on the covers with cherry red lips parted and legs wrapped around Fuma's waist, pushing up everywhere he can, Fuma's shirt hanging open as he's nursing a hickey just below Marius' collarbone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck yeah we are,” he groans, gesturing towards the headboard with one hand before clutching it right back at Fuma's shoulderblades as he throws his head back on a loud moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma looks up from Marius' skin at Kento's voice and their eyes meet for an electric second before Kento turns to look for the lube like the true adult.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou kicks off the rest of his clothes and shoves them over the edge of the bed, trying to reach for Shori's shirt behind him but it doesn't go very well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His mission falters when Kento returns in front of him, scattering a bunch of condoms next to him and pops open the cap on a fresh bottle of lube.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can't believe you,” Kento mumbles in Marius' general direction at the obvious preparatory shopping that has been done, but Marius isn't listening to a word he's saying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou slides down to lie on his back and Shori carefully scoots closer, Sou's head ending up in his lap and he feels Shori's erection twitch through the thick denim as Sou shamelessly spreads his legs for Kento. It does feel a little awkward, but he's so turned on he doesn't give a damn about what he looks like right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento raises an eyebrow in amusement as he coats his fingers in transparent gel, and Sou shudders in anticipation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turns his head as the first finger brushes his rim, making it contract and his skin breaks out in goosebumps. He finds his mouth just next to Shori's dick, and he purposefully exhales his noises against it, hot wet breaths through the fabric that makes Shori's fingers dig into his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento's first finger slides inside him smoother than it should, and Sou's world seems to stop for a moment. He groans and shifts, hyper aware of the foreign bodypart exploring his insides, and he forces his eyes open to see that it's really Kento.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento’s lips are slightly parted and his expression focused, eyes smudged dark with eyeliner and Sou pushes down on his finger because he wants more. Kento glances up at him under fluttering eyelashes, and the knowing little smirk is enough to make Sou's toes curl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Kento's eyes lift and Sou sees him speak more than he really takes in the words. “Shori, why don't you take off some clothes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou looks up to see Shori's shirt come over his head, exposing smooth skin over subtle muscle and he wishes he could get up and kiss it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He groans embarrassingly loud when another finger gently slips inside him like there's no resistance at all, and Shori's fingertips touch his face to turn it aside as he opens his pants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The massive dick springs out against Sou's cheek, and he turns his head right back and starts mouthing at it without thinking, Shori's gasps of pleasure immediately raising in pitch. Meanwhile, Kento's making magic happen inside him, pushing and pressing and sliding just where he wants it, and Sou's crying out against Shori's dick more than he’s doing any actual work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” he hears vaguely, and he tries to zone back in to reality, placing the voice as Marius' and he looks over to find Marius looking straight at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or more accurately, straight at where Kento's now fourth finger pushes inside him, stretching him embarrassingly wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius' eyes are glazed over and he's got one hand in Fuma's hair and one leg up by his shoulder as Fuma's pushing a finger inside him in turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Sou repeats, and Marius' eyes meet his for a moment, the smile on his lips filthy, and Sou involuntarily contracts around Kento's finger. Shori's erection smears precome on his forehead as he shifts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, that's enough,” Kento says, voice low and rough and Sou shudders as those magical fingers withdraw. “Or Shori's not going to make it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am too,” Shori protests, but as Sou looks up his eyes are half lidded and his cheeks are flushed a delicious crimson that spreads down his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento just smiles and offers him a condom, which Shori accepts. Sou starts trying to regain control of his body, dragging his heavy limbs around to settle on his hands and knees, hoping to suck Kento's dick as his hole contracts almost painfully at being so empty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kento...” Marius' voice comes over, light and breathy, and Sou would curse him if it wasn't so hot. “Do that to me too. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius has pushed at Fuma to sit up and has an arm wrapped around his shoulders, slowly grinding down on his two fingers while looking over at the others, unable to really keep from watching Sou and Shori while trying to beckon Kento over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou watches Kento shift over to the other pair, watches him wipe his fingers on the duvet before accepting the bottle of lube offered to him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then he feels hands on his hips and the blunt head of an erection against his hole, and Sou cries out in harmony with Marius as Shori starts pushing inside and Kento's finger joins Fuma's two.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck!” Sou grits out because Shori really is a lot to take, stretching him to his limits as he pushes inside very slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay?” Shori gasps out, and Sou just bites his lip and nods because damn he's going to take all of this dick whatever it takes. He just can't speak while doing it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus,” Fuma speaks up, tone impressed and a little absent, and Sou glances over to see Fuma watch Shori's dick go into his ass with wide eyes while Marius impatiently tugs at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, the whole thing is inside him and Sou has to take deep, slow breaths to try and accommodate, feeling like he's about to burst while wondering why the hell he never fucked Shori before, </span>
<em>
<span>damn.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Shori waits with impressive patience, shaky breaths the only indication he's finding it hard to wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius is practically crying next to them, eyes squeezed shut as he gasps out moans while bouncing on a combination of Fuma's and Kento's fingers, one arm still wrapped around Fuma's now bare shoulders and one fisting Kento's shirt to hold him close as Kento kisses his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento and Fuma are looking at each other over Marius' shoulder, exchanging dark and suggestive looks as they almost seem to have forgotten Marius is there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I?” Shori asks then, and Sou grunts and nods, then groans loudly when the first slow thrust makes Shori's dick slide against his insides. He's thick enough to be pressing on his prostate a little all the time, and Sou's hands are trembling against the duvet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> will someone put a dick in me already?” Marius gasps, and Shori chuckles behind Sou, a rich noise that makes the hairs at the back of Sou's neck rise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento and Fuma both seem a little torn out of a trance at the words, and Kento doesn't wait for any communication before he reaches down to undo his belt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou's groaning and whining with every millimetre Shori moves inside of him, and he struggles to keep his eyes open and watch what's going on in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento's cock is red and delicious looking, only pulled out of his pants before it's covered in a condom and lube. Kento more or less pulls Marius into his lap and Marius arches into him like a porn star, slowly sliding down onto Kento's erection with an expression of bliss on his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento groans and leans his forehead against Marius' shoulder, eyes squeezing shut as he holds onto Marius' hips and waits.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma leans in to press a kiss to Marius' throat, eyes wary of Kento's position and his hands are shaking a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuma,” Shori asks then, sounding breathless and desperate as Sou feels his fingers dig deeper into the flesh of his hips. “Fuma can you- ah, can you please...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He doesn't get the rest of his sentence out and Fuma turns to him, almost gratefully, and Sou can't see what happens, but he hears the wet noises of a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I usually bottom...” Shori finally gets out, and Fuma scoffs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“With that dick? What a crime,” he says, and his voice is so husky and sexy Sou shivers, and he sees Kento's hips push up with more force, his eyes sliding open as he looks straight at Fuma with dark eyes. Sou wants them to fuck and he wants to watch them do it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bottle of lube is taken from the duvet between them, and Sou barely hears the cap pop over Marius' whining.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou’s entire body is trembling, feeling full over his limit with every thrust, and somehow he feels like Shori isn't even giving it his all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He's making all kinds of noises, but they're mostly drowned out by Marius', and he's grateful for someone being more of a shameless slut than he is. Marius looks gorgeous arching his back against Kento's chest while pushing down on his dick, his long legs helping him with the momentum, and his own erection is bouncing against his stomach, leaving trails of glistening precome on his skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento's hands run gently up and down Marius’ sides but doesn't seem to be doing it with much purpose, his lips parted and eyes dark as he watches the others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can someone touch me?” Sou finally gets out, his voice weak and whiny, and it makes Marius' eyes snap open, taking a second to focus on Sou even though he couldn’t reach if he tried.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori leans over him, covering his back with his chest and supporting himself on one arm as the other reaches down to wrap around Sou’s aching erection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou cries out as Shori tests out the pressure while speeding up the pace of his hips, and Shori's noises closer to his ears drives him closer at record speed. He moans and whines and shifts, and finally, with a deep thrust and a tight squeeze around his dick he comes, almost screaming out his moan as he spurts long ropes of come all over the duvet, Shori gently milking his orgasm out of him until the last drop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, fuck, fuckfuckfuck,” he chants as the heat in his veins passes and he immediately feels like he can't take any more, his body working against the way too big intrusion it craved just a few seconds ago. “Too much, too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori whines but carefully starts pulling out, and Sou tries to stop his body from buzzing as Shori slowly slips out of him. He feels empty and filthy yet completely numb, and he collapses onto the duvet into his own come and can't even be bothered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck me,” he hears Shori ask, voice feverish, and he has to turn around to see, Shori's face flushed and his eyes so dark they're only black, his hands trembling and his still coated erection hanging heavy between his legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma drops his pants and grasps for a condom, and Marius cries out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There's a soft laugh from Kento and Sou glances over to watch him leaning up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you like that Mari?” he asks softly, voice low and breathy, but clearly raising his voice a little from what he’s obviously been saying earlier, and Marius’ eyes squeeze shut. “You like watching them, don't you? Do you wish Fuma was fucking you? I bet he would if you asked him nicely.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius makes a garbled noise that might have been words, and Fuma looks up to meet Kento's eyes for a moment, then glances at Marius, pausing in his movement as he does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fumaaa,” Shori whines, and he quickly continues, guiding Shori back down to his hands and knees with a hand between his shoulder blades and starts pushing inside him. Shori gasps and his eyes fall closed, lips parting, and Sou can tell he definitely likes bottoming more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He slowly sits up against his aching abs, listening to Kento mumbling filth to Marius who's losing it more and more, and crawls forward to press a kiss to Shori's parted lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori jerks but then leans into it, mostly trying to catch his breath against Sou's tongue as Fuma starts fucking him, making him rock forward from the momentum.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There's a cry from the side and Sou quickly looks up to watch Marius spurting come everywhere, Kento's hands digging nails into his thighs and holding him still, pressing a smile into his shoulder blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hot,” Kento compliments softly, and Marius collapses back against him, flushed down to his belly button and his bangs are hanging in sweaty wisps in his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou can only agree.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori makes another pitying noise, falling down onto his elbows as Fuma keeps fucking him, and Sou starts moving in to help him when Marius falls down just next to him, eyes glazed and a smile on his lips that Sou ends up kissing out of pure reflex.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There's the sound of clothing being shed and the snap of a condom, the cap of the lube popping again, but Sou's lost in the sweetness of kissing Marius again and doesn't pay much attention. Until Shori cries out desperately and they both turn their heads to look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma's tugged Shori back up, holding him against his chest and stroking him rather roughly, the condom he had discarded somewhere, and Shori's almost crying with how close he must be.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma sees their looks and reacts with a smile, beckoning them over, and they exchange a look before crawling over. Marius takes over Fuma's grip on Shori's erection and Sou leans in with his mouth again, Marius' tongue meeting his from the other side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shori makes a garbled noise and comes. Sou instinctively pulls back but Marius cuddles into Shori's dick like a cat, getting a spray of come across his cheek and into his hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft moan from behind Marius makes Sou tear his eyes away to find Kento on his knees with his fingers inside himself, eyes dark as he watches Shori collapse against Sou's shoulder, looking ready to pass out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Marius smiles and licks some come from the corner of his mouth, catching Shori's eyes as he does so and Shori shudders against Sou's side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kento,” Fuma says, voice shaky, and Sou looks up with all the interest he can muster right now, blindly repositioning Shori so that he gets a good view too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma's coated erection is still hard and his cheeks are flushed, and finally the tension between them seems to snap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento reaches out for him and Fuma obeys, not pausing for a second before crashing their lips together. Kento moans into the kiss and tangles his sticky hand into Fuma's hair, tugging sharply and causing Fuma to make a high-pitched noise into the kiss that makes Sou and Marius exchange a surprised look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It becomes pretty obvious that their awkward looks weren't just fantasies as Fuma smoothly pushes Kento onto his back, biting at his neck and Kento's legs spread way too naturally to accommodate him between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He cries out and tosses his head back as Fuma doesn't waste any time before pushing inside him, not quite as gentle as he was with Shori but Kento seems to love it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's everything he imagined and more, Sou thinks as he watches Fuma start fucking Kento into the mattress, his tired erection twitching angrily and he feels his skin tingle as Kento moans and claws at Fuma's skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then his eyes slide open and he looks at the three younger ones watching them like an audience in a row, and smiles for a second before Fuma's hips slam into his and his face contorts in ecstasy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They're good,” Marius leans in to mumble, coming up to Sou's side and blindly reaches for Sou's awakening erection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Sou replies, hips snapping up into Marius' hand as he leans in to lick Shori's come from Marius’ cheek, careful to keep watching Fuma and Kento.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma's bangs are dripping sweat onto Kento's collarbones and Sou wants to lick that up too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuma please,” Kento finally gets out, voice broken and desperate, and Fuma reaches for Kento's erection, stroking like he knows exactly how to do it and it only takes a few moments for Kento to arch his back and come, covering his own chest in transparent white.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou gasps and comes with Fuma just a few moment later, his second orgasm making him feel scorched but it burns so fucking good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma leans in to place a gentle kiss on Kento's parted lips before withdrawing, and Marius moans inexplicably, making Sou lean down to see him slowly palming himself, fully hard. He is the youngest after all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sou reaches over to return the favour, drowning Marius' moans with a deep kiss that Shori takes over, and Sou presses a deep kiss against Fuma's hickey on Marius' chest as he comes for the second time, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh don't start over again,” Fuma asks as he looks over at them after discarding the condom, some of Kento's come glistening on his ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was so fucking hot,” Sou says, indicating everything, and Kento's slowly tugging at his messy hair as he sits up, looking worn out and sated and fucking gorgeous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you it was a good idea,” Marius tells them, sounding a little too content with himself. “We should do this annually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please, I wouldn't survive it,” Shori sighs, leaning back against the pillows, but then looks over at Kento thoughtfully. “And we only got to kiss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Being more than three is hopeless,” Kento sighs, but then smiles with a teasing sparkle in his eyes. “Right Fuma?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuma coughs and looks another direction, and Marius' eyes narrow. “Yeah what's up with this thing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kento shrugs and Fuma clicks his tongue, firmly not meeting Marius' eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So is there a huge bath here too?” he asks, clearly to deflect the question, and Marius parts his lips to continue his inquiries, but then sighs and nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” he agrees. “We can do round two there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His suggestion is met with groans of the less enthusiastic kind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay, we can do the cuddling there. Can't sleep in this filthy bed now anyway,” he settles, and eventually manages to drag them all to the bathroom and the jacuzzi.</span>
