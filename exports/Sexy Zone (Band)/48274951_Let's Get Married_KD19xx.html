    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>It was Monday night and Fuma was just so exhausted, he just wanted to go home and lie down tomorrow is his birthday but he still have to work. He misses someone so badly and he hasn’t spent quality time with him because of their jampacked work schedules. Fuma is filming for two dramas, their promotion for their new single then they also have to prepare for their concert so he also needs to attend meetings and check with the equipment that needs to be used for the concert. He really wanted to spend his birthday with the man he loves but because of their schedules, they can’t do it, while he is inside their company car, he just looked out the window reminiscing about that time when they finally talked about their feelings for each other 9 years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Fuma didn’t even know if it was just the right thing to do, he felt like it is a stupid move and that he had to ask help from their senpai but he told himself that this is now or never. So he agreed to Yamapi’s suggestion to come with him on the last day of Kenty’s solo live. This is the first time he felt so nervous in his life, his hands are shaking and his sweating like he just came from a 10 Km jog.</p><p>They entered the hall, gladly no one noticed him he is really hiding his face well much like he is hiding behind his senpai Yamapi. They watched the concert, and he can see that Kenty is shining on stage “Being an idol is really made for him” he said to himself this is also one of the things that he admired about him Kenty's determination on being an idol despite B.I. shadow had to disband and they left their friends to debut, he knows that it was painful for Kenty too but he had to be strong not just for himself but also for the three youngest that is now in their group. During those years he was actually somehow mad at Kenty as to why he had to act as if nothing happened when they were separated from their friends they promised to debut together but it didn’t happen, and because of it he tried to ignore Kenty, he stopped hanging out with him but Kenty never complained by the cold shoulders that Fuma was giving him instead he just kept working because he is the oldest and he needs to look after Mari, Sou, and Shori. They continued with that setup for years but Fuma felt that this isn’t really healthy for their group as he can see the effect of it with the other three, he really wanted to talk to Kenty about what they really felt for each other but he just can’t seem to muster the courage and every time he is thinking of finally talking to him but of them are really busy. So even if he is really not prepared he is thankful for his Senpai after they talked about it because Fuma doesn’t want to part from Kenty and he finally gets to love the group they are in now.</p><p>Finally, it is the MC part of the concert, a staff walked towards them he tried to hide his face. The staff was surprised to see Fuma but he still proceeded in giving the mic to Yamapi after that he signaled the other crew to let Kenty know that Yamapi’s presence in the venue.</p><p>Kenty was shocked to see Yamapi but was stunned when his senpai said “I brought someone along, Fuma!” then Fuma finally showed his face then Yamapi passed the mic to Fuma.</p><p>Kenty can’t believe it the man who has been giving him a cold shoulder all these years is finally here at the last day of his solo concert.</p><p>Fuma finally spoke “Hello, sorry for interrupting”</p><p>“Why so awkward?” Yamapi said to his kouhai beside him.</p><p>After some talks Kenty started singing again it was Fuma’s favorite solo of his Dear High Heels, again Fuma was reminded of how his partner since their jr days is sparkling when he is on stage performing. He told himself this is the man he loved so dearly but was afraid to admit it to himself.</p><p>The concert was finished and all of the fans have left the venue but Fuma is still sitting at the audience seat he is waiting for Yamapi to come back who went backstage to greet Kenty and congratulate him for a job well done. He was asked to come with him but Fuma refused and insisted that he will just wait for him. He still was so tensed, he has been rehearsing what he will say but he is unsure if he will be able to say it to him, he received a message from his best friend Juri asking him what happened and if he was rejected, he still has beers on his fridge they can drink. Fuma just smiled at Juri's message he knows that the man is worried about him because it was Juri who knows everything and he’s been his lending ear during those years when he is giving Kenty the cold shoulder. He was about to reply to Juri’s message when Yamapi called him, “Fuma” The man was smiling while walking towards him.</p><p>“Someone wants to talk to you,” Yamapi said then Kenty showed up from behind him looking down like a child being shy. Yamapi leaned forward and whispered to Fuma “I’ll leave the two of you to talk, don’t mess this shit up ok? You got this” Then he tapped the younger man’s shoulder. Yamapi looked behind him “Kenty, I’ll go ahead first ok? Contact me if there’s anything you need ok?” He winked at his kouhai and then walked away.</p><p>Fuma was still sitting looking at the stage trying to avoid the older’s gaze, Kenty who was standing beside him cleared his throat and said “Can I sit beside you?”</p><p>“Yeah, go ahead” Fuma responded.</p><p>“So, how was it?” Kenty asked also looking at the empty stage where he just performed a few hours ago.</p><p>“It was good, I am reminded once more that you are born to perform and be an idol. You were sparkling on stage” Fuma said and it wasn’t just lip service because being with Kenty for years watching him from afar he is very well aware of when his partner is on stage performing.</p><p>“Well, thanks,” Kenty said shyly while scratching his head.</p><p>“You see,” Both of them said facing each other, then they smiled.</p><p>“You go ahead first Fuma” Kenty said facing the stage once more.</p><p>“Nah, you go first Nakajima” Fuma said not removing his eyes from Kenty.</p><p>Kenty gathered all his courage and tried to calm himself because his heart is about to burst with how Fuma looked at him. He cleared his throat and still avoided Fuma’s gaze because he might lose his composure if he will face him directly, “I was surprised that you came today, I didn’t expect that you’d be here” he said.</p><p>“It’s no big deal, I don’t want to be an ass of a member if I won’t come,” The younger said.</p><p>“I see, thank you but that’s not what I really wanted to say,” The older by-a-week said.</p><p>“Then what is it?” Fuma said, still trying to keep his cool but he is already shaking in nervousness.</p><p>Kenty sat up straight and cleared his throat but then a hand caressed his face and made him face the one seated beside him. It was Fuma’s warm hands and suddenly his lips were caught by him and gave him a sweet soft kiss.</p><p>Fuma looked him straight in the eye with so much love and longing that they haven’t seen each other for years. “I miss you and I am really sorry for acting that way all these years,” The man said to him which caught Kenty off-guard but all he could do was also caressed the hands of the man he loved all these years, he had been praying for this time to come that they will be able to see each other eye to eye.</p><p>Kenty smiled at him “Stupid! I missed you too” Then Fuma hugged him so tight, the warmth of his arms made him feel finally this is the start of their new chapter.</p><p> </p><p>The company van suddenly stops they finally arrived at his home, Fuma didn’t notice it as he was lost in his thoughts of that fateful day that changed their lives. He thanked the driver as he steps outside of the car. Fuma entered the high-rise apartment input his keys and went straight to the elevator, he pushed the button to go to one of the upper floors. Fuma checked his phone if he got any message from his lover but there was not and it was already 11:30 p.m. only 30 mins before his birthday. The elevator then opens, he stepped out and walked towards his room. He placed the keys to unlock it, took off his shoes, and wear his slippers. Fuma was so tired so he decided to take a rest on the sofa first but he was shocked that the door to the veranda is open and he can see a silhouette of a figure. Fuma was sure that he locked those before he left. So with a heart beating so fast, he stepped closer to check who was the figure that was standing on the veranda. He slowly opens the white curtains and there stands the man he was just thinking about a few minutes ago, he is wearing a white polo and black pants his face is illuminated and he looks so beautiful under the moonlight. Fuma didn’t realize that he has been standing there for minutes already, it felt like time stopped when he saw the man he loves all these years smiling at him.</p><p>Kenty cleared his throat “How long do you plan on standing there?” he said smiling.</p><p>Fuma went back to his senses and realized that he has been standing there for far too long “Oh sorry, you scared me. I thought someone forced themselves into my apartment like a burglar or something” he said.</p><p>Kenty laughed “I am too handsome and rich to be a burglar you know,” He said jokingly.</p><p>Fuma walked towards his lover and hugged him so tight that the older responded with a tighter one. He whispered, “I missed you, I thought, I won’t see you before my birthday”.</p><p>Kenty smiled “Stupid, we just saw each other yesterday”</p><p>Fuma broke their hug and then placed a sweet soft kiss on Kenty’s lips then he spoke “I know but I mean this, like some quality time you know?” and then kissed him again but this time more passionately, Fuma used his tongue to open his lover’s mouth which Kenty followed what his lover wants, his mind is going crazy when Fuma’s tongue was passionately twirled around his, but instead of resisting, he held the other flushed against his body. Fuma decided to break their kiss both of them are breathless.</p><p>Fuma looked him straight in the eye as he caressed his cheeks and smiled “I love you so much” Kenty just smiled and held his lover's hands that is on his cheeks.</p><p>Both of them decided to sit on the bench, Fuma placed his hands on Kenty’s shoulders. The older just rest his head on the younger’s shoulders. They are both looking at the clear moonlit sky.</p><p>Fuma placed a small kiss on his lover’s head and then spoke “You know when I was looking at you earlier, I thought about how beautiful you are and how lucky I am to have you in my life” he said which made Kenty wondered why his lover is suddenly saying these things though Fuma is someone who may look like someone who messes around he is a very passionate person and thoughtful.</p><p>“Why are you suddenly saying this?” Kenty said.</p><p>“When I was looking at you, it felt like the time suddenly stopped. You know like from those you see in romantic movies and I thought this is the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with” Fuma added.</p><p>Kenty decided to face Fuma “Eh? What’s happening? Why so sudden?” he said while nervously laughing.</p><p>There was a short silence Fuma took a deep breath and looked at the older’s dark eyes “What I am saying is, if I ask you to marry me will you say yes?”</p><p>Kenty was speechless he was shocked by what the younger just said. He composed himself “Stupid! Of course, I would say yes”</p><p>Fuma held his head to rest it on his shoulders and then he spoke “That’s good then, I’ll tell the agency tomorrow about it” He then kissed Kenty’s head again.</p><p>“But will they agree to it?” Kenty said.</p><p>“They already allowed Miyata-san and Tamamori-san to get married. So they will also allow us. Don’t worry I got this” Fuma said while stroking his lover’s head.</p><p>“Ok, but I will decide on what we will wear, the guests, venue…”Kenty wanted to continue but he was stopped when Fuma caught his lips and placed a sweet soft kiss.</p><p>Fuma smiled and then spoke “hai, hai. We can continue talking about this but I want to do other things with that lips of yours” he smirked and then he carried Kenty princess style and kissed him again. Kenty placed his hands on his lover’s shoulder to support his weight while smiling shyly.</p>
