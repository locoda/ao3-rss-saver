      <p>"So~ what are you?" Kento beamed at Fuma who was raising his eyebrows in response.</p><p>"What am I? What do you mean?"</p><p>Kento tsked, "You know, in the press conference you did today, the MC asked you about 'seme' and 'uke'."</p><p>Fuma nodded, "Then?"</p><p>Kento smiled widely, "What is your answer then? Since you didn't answer in the press conference, I was curious about it."</p><p>"What are you curious about? You know it already." Fuma chuckled and ruffled Kento's hair as he passed him towards the kitchen.</p><p>Kento frowned and followed Fuma, "What do you mean I know it? I don't know unless you tell me, Fuma!"</p><p>Fuma took a glass of water, drank it to the bottom and looked at Kento. "Come here, Kento."</p><p>Kento walked closer to Fuma and to his surprise, Fuma yanked him to his embrace. Fuma's hands circled around his waist and his face buried on his hair.</p><p>"I love your scent. What's your shampoo?" Fuma asked as he breathed in Kento's hair.</p><p>Kento put his hands on Fuma's chest, clutching on his shirt. "It's the same as yours, dummy."</p><p>Fuma humming approvingly, "But it smells different on you. It feels like home. <em>I'm home</em>."</p><p>Kento laughed, "<em>Welcome home</em>, Fuma."</p><p>Then, they went silent for a few minutes. They were enjoying each other's embrace and presence.<em> It does feel like home</em>, Kento thought. </p><p>"Do you really want to know what my answer is?"</p><p>Kento, who had almost forgotten the conversation they were doing before, nodded and let Fuma continue.</p><p>"It's both."</p><p>"Eh?" Kento looked up at Fuma, his big brown eyes met Fuma's soft gaze.</p><p>"Either it's giving or receiving, I will get flustered, as long as it's you." Fuma leaned down and pecked Kento's nose tip.</p><p>Kento blinked and his cheeks flushed as he realised what Fuma meant. "I thought I was the one who was responsible for cheesy and romantic things?" He looked away and tried to get rid of the hot blush that creeped on his cheeks and ears.</p><p>Fuma chuckled, "Yes, you are." This time he aimed at Kento's plump lips and kissed him slowly.</p><p>"You know?" Fuma asked as he leaned back to took a breath. Kento, who was still breathing heavily and felt dizzy after the kiss, only shook his head.</p><p>Fuma tightened his embrace on Kento's waist, "I like both being undressed by you or being the one who is undressing you. But, do you know what I like the most?"</p><p>Kento shook his head again, "What is it?" He looked at Fuma and waited for his answer.</p><p>Fuma grinned widely, "What I like the most is when you're beneath me and I was inside you."</p><p>Kento's eyes widened and his cheeks flushed again, much redder than the previous.</p><p>"KIKUCHI FUMA!!!"</p><p>Fuma laughed, so loud and sounded annoying in Kento's ears. But, a few seconds later, Kento found himself laughing with Fuma.</p><p>It feels like home, no, <em><strong>it is home</strong></em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>fin.</p>
