<em>
<strong>Fuma</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Hey, Fuma."</p><p align="justify">Fuma frowned, "Me?"</p><p align="justify">Kento nodded, "Yes. I'm talking to you, Fuma."</p><p align="justify">"Wait. What's going on? Why are you suddenly calling me Fuma?"</p><p align="justify">Kento shrugged, "I don't know. I just want to."</p><p align="justify">Fuma stopped reading his script and put it down on the table. "That's weird."</p><p align="justify">"Why~? Everyone calls you Fuma."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah. But you don't usually call me Fuma. It feels weird."</p><p align="justify">Kento pouted, his moist eyes looking at Fuma, "You're so mean."</p><p align="justify">Fuma didn't reply, he took his script and continued to read it.</p><p align="justify">After being silent for a few minutes, Kento stood up from his chair and sat beside Fuma.</p><p align="justify">Fuma glanced at him for a second then immersed himself on the script again.</p><p align="justify">"Hey, Fuma. Do you know?"</p><p align="justify">"I don't know."</p><p align="justify">"I love Fuma."</p><p align="justify">Fuma sighed, "I know. So?"</p><p align="justify">Kento hit Fuma's shoulder, "You should say that you love me too!"</p><p align="justify">"I love you."</p><p align="justify">"That's not sincere! Fuma, come on!"</p><p align="justify">"I love Nakajima the most."</p><p align="justify">Kento felt hot blush creeped on his cheeks, "T-that's too much and you call me Nakajima! You have to call me Kento!"</p><p align="justify">Fuma tsked, he threw his script away and pulled Kento into a kiss. He put his right hand on the back of Kento's head and deepened their kiss.</p><p align="justify">Kento stared at Fuma, wide-eyed in surprise, "Mmh!" He tried to stop the kiss but Fuma changed the angle and licked Kento's lips as if asking permission to enter Kento's mouth.</p><p align="justify">"A-aah!" Soon after Kento opened his mouth to moan, Fuma's tongue entered Kento's mouth, licking Kento's teeth and colliding their tongue. He grabbed Kento's jaw and kissed him until saliva drooling from the corner of Kento's mouth.</p><p align="justify">Kento hit Fuma's shoulder several times in order to make him stop. Fuma bit Kento's lower lip before he leaned back and wiped up saliva from Kento's jaw and lips.</p><p align="justify">"You're so noisy. Stop blabbering or else I'll kiss you again."</p><p align="justify">Kento, who was still out of breath, only glared at Fuma. His eyes were full of water and his cheeks were flushed. "I hate you."</p><p align="justify">Fuma chuckled, "I love you too, Kento."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Understanding</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Fuma glanced at Kento when the intro of 'RUN' started playing. Kento didn't look at him but Fuma knew very well how Kento felt. He knew what was going on in Kento's head.</p><p align="justify">Fuma and Kento were doing their usual back-to-back choreography but when they were supposed to move, Kento didn't move and even started to put his head on Fuma's shoulder.</p><p align="justify">Fuma was shocked for a while but then he laughed. He knew. He knew that Kento didn't want this to end. Kento wanted to be on his back until the end of the song. It was their last back-to-back on the concert stage.</p><p align="justify">Kento without a doubt put all of his weight on Fuma's back. He also knew. He knew Fuma wouldn't let him fall down. Their hair was colliding, their heart beat at the same pace, and their mind thought the same thing. <em>I didn't want to let go of this moment. I would cherish this moment for the rest of my life.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Morning</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sun was shining brightly, birds chirped and the wind breezed gently. Kento opened his eyes and all he could see was his lover's chest. Kento tried to move but the hand that circled his waist stopped his movement. It was Fuma's hand. He embraced Kento in his arm all night.</p><p align="justify">"Kikuchi, wake up." Kento looked up at Fuma and whispered.</p><p align="justify">Fuma opened his eyes, "Morning, Nakajima." He said with a hoarse voice, then pecked Kento's nose tip.</p><p align="justify">Kento giggled, "Morning, Kikuchi." He kissed Fuma's jaw in return.</p><p align="justify">"What time is it?"</p><p align="justify">"I don't know. Maybe around 9 am?"</p><p align="justify">"Oh." Fuma pulled Kento closer to his body, "Why are you waking up so early? Let's sleep again."</p><p align="justify">Kento pouted, "No, Kikuchi! I want to spend our day off with things we couldn't do when we both had work."</p><p align="justify">"Sleeping together is one of them. We couldn't sleep together when we had work."</p><p align="justify">"Kikuchi!!!" Kento hit Fuma's shoulder with an usual strength and it made Fuma groan in pain.</p><p align="justify">"Okay, okay." Fuma loosened his hug and let Kento get out of their bed. He saw his lover stretched and couldn't help but let out a laugh.</p><p align="justify">Kento frowned, "What are you laughing at?"</p><p align="justify">"You're so cute."</p><p align="justify">Kento ignored him and quickly walked out of the room. But, he didn't know that Fuma already saw his red ears.</p><p align="justify">After a few minutes, Fuma decided to follow Kento. When he opened the door, a sweet smell of coffee wafted from the kitchen. Fuma walked to the kitchen and found Kento was brewing coffee with an apron on.</p><p align="justify">"Kikuchi! You startled me!" Kento complained when Fuma suddenly hugged him from behind. Fuma chuckled and responded with a kiss on Kento's nape.</p><p align="justify">"Nakajima, let's spend the morning together for the rest of our life."</p><p align="justify">Kento didn't answer but turned his body to face Fuma. He looked at Fuma with tears welled up in his big eyes. "I love you, Fuma." Then he hugged Fuma tightly and buried his face on Fuma's shoulder.</p><p align="justify">"I love you too." Fuma whispered and tightened his hug.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Attractive</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Fuma kissed Kento's eyes, and looked at the big black orbs that sparkled beautifully. Fuma really really loved Kento's eyes. They were so beautiful.</p><p align="justify">"I can stare at your eyes all day, you don't know how much I love your eyes."</p><p align="justify">Kento giggled, "You're so cheesy. I love your eyes too."</p><p align="justify">"I'm serious. Your eyes are so beautiful. The most beautiful eyes I've ever seen." Fuma kissed Kento's eyes one more time before he pulled Kento's right leg and put it to his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">"What are you going to do, Kikuchi?"</p><p align="justify">"Have I said before that I also love your leg?"</p><p align="justify">Kento shook his head, then without a word Fuma kissed Kento's ankle.</p><p align="justify">"Kikuchi, wait!"</p><p align="justify">Fuma didn't bother to obey Kento's word, he started to give kisses from Kento's ankle to his inner thigh.</p><p align="justify">"Nakajima, your legs are so beautiful. You can step on me and I'll thank you instead."</p><p align="justify">Kento covered his face with his hands. Hot blush creeped on his cheeks, ears and even neck.</p><p align="justify">"I love you, Nakajima." Fuma bit Kento's inner thigh and earned a small moan from Kento.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Kids</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Kento bit his lower lip while looking at the thing in his hand. It was a pregnancy test pack. He already tried several test packs and all of them have two red lines in it which means positive. He's pregnant. Kento is pregnant.</p><p align="justify">"Is it true? Am I dreaming?" Kento couldn't hold his tears and started crying in the bathroom. After his cry subsided, Kento stood up and with a wide smile blooming on his lips he opened the bathroom door. It's already 9 pm but Fuma hadn't come home yet, so Kento decided to wait for him while cooking something.</p><p align="justify">An hour later, Kento finished cooking and started to arrange the dish on the dining table. Soon, he heard Fuma said “I'm home.” Kento quickly ran to the entrance and said, "Welcome home, Kikuchi!"</p><p align="justify">"Oh, why are you so happy? Did something good happen?"</p><p align="justify">Kento nodded excitedly, "Yes! I can't wait to tell you about it but let's have dinner first."</p><p align="justify">"Wait, Nakajima." Fuma grabbed Kento's arm before he left and looked at him suspiciously.</p><p align="justify">"Um? What's wrong Kikuchi?"</p><p align="justify">"Did you cry? Your eyes are kind of swollen."</p><p align="justify">Kento was silent for a second then he smiled, "Yes. But it's tears of happiness. No need to worry, Kikuchi."</p><p align="justify">"But…"</p><p align="justify">"No but, Kikuchi. Let's eat before the food gets cold." Kento pulled Fuma to the dining table and urged him to sit down.</p><p align="justify">Fuma still hesitated but he obeyed Kento's words.</p><p align="justify">"It looks so delicious. Do you cook this by yourself?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes! I know you love my carbonara pasta so I decided to make it." Kento smiled, showing his cute front teeth.</p><p align="justify">Fuma also smiled and then ruffled Kento's hair. His action made Kento groan in annoyance.</p><p align="justify">They started to eat in silence and after finishing the meal, Kento stood up in order to wash the dishes but Fuma stopped him.</p><p align="justify">"Nakajima, you can wash the dishes later. Now, tell me what happened."</p><p align="justify">Nakajima took a long breath, his fingers fidgeted, then with a small voice Fuma barely heard he said, "Fuma, you're going to be a father."</p><p align="justify">"Huh?"</p><p align="justify">"I'm pregnant." Kento looked directly at Fuma's eyes.</p><p align="justify">Fuma opened his mouth but nothing came out, wide-eyed in surprise. "You're what?"</p><p align="justify">Kento sighed, sometimes Fuma's brain is too slow. "I'm pregnant, Kikuchi Fuma. I'm carrying your baby. Your omega is pregnant now."</p><p align="justify">Fuma suddenly stood up, walked closer to Kento and then yanked him to his embrace. He hugged Kento tightly while stroking Kento's back. "Thank you, Kento. Thank you so much." Tears welled up in his eyes, Fuma cried while buried his face on Kento's black hair.</p><p align="justify">Kento laughed, patted Fuma's wide back and said, "It's okay, Fuma. Don't cry."</p><p align="justify">"It's the best news I've ever heard in my whole life. My beloved omega carrying my baby. That's amazing. I'm going to be a father, oh my God it feels like a dream."</p><p align="justify">Fuma leaned back, kissed Kento several times, and looked at Kento's eyes lovingly. After that Fuma kneeled down, kissed Kento's stomach and whispered. "Hi, baby. This is your Papa. I hope you will be a good kid. Don't make your Mama suffer, okay?"</p><p align="justify">Kento laughed, "Okay, Papa Fuma. Now, let Mama Kento wash the dishes."</p><p align="justify">Fuma pouted, "No. I will wash the dishes. You need to rest."</p><p align="justify">Kento nodded, "Then I leave the rest to you. I'll wait in the bedroom. I want you to scent me."</p><p align="justify">Fuma stood up, pecked Kento's cheek, "As your wish, my omega."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Emergencies</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Fuma-kun! Fuma-kun! It's an emergency!" So ran into the dressing room. He opened the door and he was breathing heavily.</p><p align="justify">Fuma, who was sitting on the sofa, frowned and asked So, "What's wrong, So-chan?"</p><p align="justify">"Kenty–"</p><p align="justify">"What happened to Nakajima?"</p><p align="justify">"Kenty fell down from the stage!"</p><p align="justify">Fuma immediately ran to the stage, his heart was beating fast. Soon, he arrived backstage and found Kento was unconscious.</p><p align="justify">"Nakajima!" Fuma shouted and crouched down next to Kento's lying body. He held Kento's right hand then asked the staff, "What's going on? Did Nakajima really fall down from the stage?"</p><p align="justify">The staff shook his head, "No. Nakajima-san fainted on stage and fortunately we could catch him before he fell."</p><p align="justify">Fuma breathed in relief, he thought Kento really fell down from the stage and injured his body. Fuma looked at Kento's face, Kento's face was so pale and his eye bags were dark. He didn't get enough sleep due to the packed schedule he had.</p><p align="justify">"Ngh–" Kento suddenly groaned in pain, his eyelashes fluttering. "What's going on?" Kento asked while looking around.</p><p align="justify">"Kikuchi?" He stopped looking around when he saw Fuma looked at him worriedly. Fuma's eyes were teary and looked like he was near to tearing up.</p><p align="justify">"Don't scare me, you idiot."</p><p align="justify">"Sorry. I didn't mean to." Kento stretched his left hand to touch Fuma's cheek. "Don't cry. I'm okay. I just feel kind of dizzy."</p><p align="justify">Fuma kissed the back of Kento's right hand, "You need more rest, please don't force yourself."</p><p align="justify">"I know it, Kikuchi. But, I couldn't sleep when I'm at home, I don't know why."</p><p align="justify">"Then, you can sleep at my home. I'll sing you a lullaby and do anything to make you sleep."</p><p align="justify">Kento widened his eyes, "Are you sure, Kikuchi?"</p><p align="justify">Fuma nodded, "I'm sure. Let's live together, Kento."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify">.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>
<strong>Nightmare</strong>
</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Kento thrashed in his sleep, tears streaming down his cheeks, and his eyebrows furrowed.</p><p align="justify">"Fuma, Fuma don't leave me." He mumbled and his hand stretched as if he wanted to reach something or someone.</p><p align="justify">Fuma, who was sleeping beside him, opened his eyes and saw Kento was crying. He frantically tried to wake Kento up.</p><p align="justify">"Nakajima! Nakajima, wake up!" Fuma patted Kento's wet cheek several times.</p><p align="justify">"Fu-Fuma?"</p><p align="justify">"Yes, I'm here. What are you dreaming about?"</p><p align="justify">Kento suddenly hugged Fuma and cried on his chest. "Fuma, don't leave me."</p><p align="justify">Fuma combed Kento's tangled hair, "I won't leave you. So, tell me what's going on, okay?"</p><p align="justify">"You left me. You broke up with me in my dream. You chose the new member of timelesz to be your lover and left me alone. I'm so scared Fuma."</p><p align="justify">"That's just a dream. In reality, I will never leave you let alone break up with you. That won't happen." Fuma kissed the crown of Kento's head. "Sorry for making you anxious. I promise I will reassure you again and again so you don't have to be scared that I will leave you alone."</p><p align="justify">Kento nodded and tightened his hug. "Thank you, Fuma."</p><p align="justify">Fuma smiled, "My pleasure. I love you. Let's sleep again."</p>
