  <p>Since Shokichi met Nesmith years ago he has felt sparks between them .  Nesmith  noticed Shokichi biting  his lip  and instinctively wrapped his arms around him.  He looks down at the man whose face is buried in his chest.   Now a days Shokichi has  Nesmith 's arms around him every day. " Sho do you have a crush on me ? "  He asks and felt a squeeze and  heard a yawn.  Shokichi clings to Nesmith as he gets carried to bed . Nesmith kissed his cheek as he felt Shokichi's lips kiss his chest then he laid Shokichi down . He got in bed and watched Shokichi snuggle close to him . " I'll take this slow baby " He said as he kissed Shokichi's lips softly . <br/>
They've been living together for years now.  Shokichi knew that Nesmith was a wolf and didn't tell the others in the group .   He used  the wolf as a pillow and held a paw  and when he woke up in the morning he noticed Nesmith was a human again. He gave him a kiss . The kisses became passionate.  Nesmith broke the kisses. He turned into a wolf noticing that Shokichi was shivering. He nuzzled his nose against Shokichi's cheek as he felt the fur being petted.  " My baby " He heard Shokichi say against his fur. He watched Shokichi get up and turned into a human again.  Shokichi got dressed . Nesmith got dressed and they both left.<br/>
Once they got to the practice room , Shokichi looked at him  shyly.  He started to practice and  blushed as Nesmith grabbed his waist. He felt a kiss  and Nesmith turned into a wolf .  Shokichi  sat  down as a paw was wrapped around him. He kissed the nose. Kenchi was looking through the window and ran in and started kicking the wolf. " Kenchi stop !" Shokichi yelled . " That's Nesmith" He said as Kenchi stopped . He patted the fur and heard a snarl. " Down baby" He whispered softly. Nesmith calmed down as Shokichi played with his fur. Kenchi  took awhile to understand and left.</p>

  <p>Nesmith changed back to human form and  wondered why Kenchi did that. He saw that Shokichi was sleeping clutching onto his shirt. " I'm going no where" He whispered into Shokichi's ear.  He turned back into a wolf after  he put Shokichi  on his  back and walked slowly out.  Akira patted the head of the wolf .

He felt a few kisses down his neck. He smiled as he fell asleep.  Nesmith fell asleep.  <br/>Shokichi woke up cuddled up against Nesmith's wolf form. He kissed the wolf's head.  " Nes I knew you were unique when I first met you at auditions" He said as he wiped a few tears away when Nesmith changed to human form.   He clings to him and gives him kisses. " Don't cry baby" Shokichi says as he hears Nesmith howl. He plays with Nesmith's hair watching Nesmith calm down.  Nesmith rubs Shokichi's back as he falls back asleep.   " My Nes" Shokichi whispered .

He giggled as Nesmith kissed him. Nesmith sat up and pulled Shokichi to his lap. He  gave Shokichi soft kisses.  Shokichi grinded against him as the kisses got more passionate then stopped . He heard a whimper and kissed Nesmith softly. <br/>They got ready and went to work . Kenchi pulled Shokichi aside and said that he'll get hurt because wolves can't be tamed . Nesmith heard this  and saw Shokichi's face . He was mad and walked over and Shokichi wrapped his arm around him.

Takahiro noticed the tension . Shokichi ran out of the room and ran to the  entertainment room. He curled up on one of the couches. <br/>Meanwhile Akira and Takahiro were fighting over who was going to find him.  Elly  found him curled up on the couch and just watched him move closer . Shokichi felt his back being rubbed. " You ran"  Elly said and Shokichi nodded.  He noticed that Takahiro was near by and Shokichi tensed up.  He heard a snarl from Shokichi who is now in wolf form . " Puppy  calm down  shh it's okay "  Elly said  as he petted the wolf. Takahiro came closer and threw Shokichi to the ground. Elly bit Takahiro instinctively when he turned into a wolf.  Shokichi whined and Akira never came for him. He knew Akira's motive was to make Takahiro look bad. Takahiro noticed that he hurt Shokichi but Shokichi came over to him limping to let out a bark and lick his wound. " I'm sorry " Takahiro whispered as he hugged the wolf . Elly moved away and turned into a human again.  He left the room.  Shokichi felt Takahiro's tears and was thrown to the wall by some magic force . He cried in pain . Akira walked in and Shokichi snarled .  Shokichi went over to Takahiro." Why are you making Takahiro fight ? He came looking for me . Why didn't you? "  Shokichi said as  he turned into a human .

" Sho calm down baby"  Takahiro whispered  into his ear. Takahiro looked at Akira with a scared look on his face as Shokichi looked at him . " I'm sorry Shokichi " Akira said as he walked out. Shokichi turned back into a human. He explained to Takahiro what happened. " Akira was controlling me and I was fighting back with my magic and it wasn't strong enough and I hurt you which never meant to happen."  Takahiro said as he kissed Shokichi's cheek softly.  " I know baby" Shokichi said  as Takahiro curled up into his chest.  " Can I come to your place ?  I'm scared of what Akira will do to us next" Takahiro asked but the last part came out as a whisper. Shokichi nodded as he put Takahiro on his back .  " Akira has it in his head that we're dating when we aren't .. he never asked ." Shokichi said  as Takahiro whispered the question that Akira was supposed to ask. " Yes baby  I'll be yours."  Shokichi said as Takahiro  buried his face in Shokichi's  back.

They both walked out of the office.   Shokichi sniffed around and wagged his tail. He felt soft strokes of his fur.

  <p>Akira teleports himself upstairs. " I'm not here to fight, Take care of Shokichi for me" He said with tears coming down his face.  Takahiro never saw Akira cry like this and he knew that Akira felt remorse for whatever he did.  Takahiro looked at him and was thinking .

  <p>Shokichi gets up from the bed  and goes to the couch and Akira watches and follows him . He watches Shokichi look at a picture of Nesmith . He notices tears on the pillow .  " Nesmith why did you hurt me ? Akira loves me so I got to forget you " He hears Shokichi whisper and pulls him close.  He lets Shokichi cry into his chest. He hears his name whispered so he holds him tighter.   Shokichi looks up at Akira and gives him a kiss. " I'm here to mend your heart Shokichi . I love you so much ."

He felt Akira move and whispered " Ryohei don't go "  and felt Akira hold him tighter. " I'm going nowhere " He heard Akira say and Nesmith was far from his mind.  He really loves Akira .  " Bubba "Shokichi whispered as Akira  kissed him softly.  " Baby if I ever hurt you .. I'm very sorry" Akira said as Shokichi  wiped his tears away.</p><p>Shokichi knew Akira was set up but he was wondering by who. He knew about the times they shared. Akira would of never hurt him while drunk someone laced the drinks and  he sensed it because Akira fainted after trying to fuck him because Akira didn't remember what happened. Akira never beat him when they dated before.  Hiro even knew this and Hiro is being told lies.</p><p>"Bubba  kisses more kisses. " Shokichi cutely whispered in Akira's ear and Akira complied as he put Shokichi in his lap. He moaned softly as he felt Akira softly thrust inside him . Akira knew that sort of calmed Shokichi down as he sped up the thrusts as the kisses became rougher.

  <p>Nesmith wakes up to Shokichi crying in his sleep. He rubs Shokichi's back softly as he calmly tells Shokichi it's okay. He feels so bad that he couldn't protect him. Shokichi still has nightmares about what Takahiro did to him .<br/>Shokichi looked up at Nesmith  once he was awake and hugged him tightly. He  felt a kiss hit his lips and kissed back.<br/>" Bubba" He whispered as Nesmith smiled at him and gave him kisses. " I remember when we first met and you were scared of me and I didn't like you much ." Nesmith said as he held  him close.  " I remember that and then we kissed after that first meeting because I was shaking real bad.' Shokichi said as he kissed Nesmith softly.  <br/>Nesmith recalled this because he remembered how scared Shokichi was because the second generation was still new.  He also remembered  how sad Shokichi was because of the lost audition . He remembered Shokichi was on his lap and how tightly he held him.<br/>Shokichi hoped Takahiro was alright . A knock was heard at the door and it was Takahiro.  Shokichi noticed this and had Nesmith answer it . Both of them noticed how shaky Takahiro was . Shokichi instinctively pulled Takahiro into his arms as he heard cries .  Nesmith noticed that Takahiro was taking so long to recover from what happened that only Shokichi can get him to talk . He just doesn't like seeing Takahiro like this . He felt Takahiro kiss his tears away.  Takahiro went back into Shokichi's arms. <br/>Why'd Akira harm them? Why'd Akira use Takahiro? Those were the thoughts in Nesmith's head.  Nesmith watched Shokichi calm Takahiro down .  He knew Shokichi was  hurt deep down but also that Takahiro didn't mean it. He kissed the tear that went down Shokichi's cheek then kissed Takahiro's cheek.<br/>Takahiro was asleep on the bed and so was Shokichi . Nesmith saw how happy they were . Shokichi's heart would break if he left again but he choose to leave . He left a note and a tear fell on it. He knew he had to go but was unsure. He left anyway . <br/>Shokichi woke up the next morning and saw the note and started crying . He didn't come into work .  Naoto and the others were worried that he didn't come in . Naoto was yelling at Nesmith  until Nesmith explained why he did what he did . Naoki chimed in and said it was unjustified. Exile is breaking apart and Naoto broke down because it was too much. Takahiro finally got Shokichi to go in after cuddling with him for an hour and a few dozen kisses. He hid behind Shokichi. Shokichi ran over to Naoto and tried to calm him down. Takahiro started to shake when Naoki approached. He felt a hug and relaxed. Shokichi exchanged Naoto for Takahiro and gave Takahiro a kiss.</p>

  <p>Shokichi saw Nesmith tear up and walked over to him and then hesitated to hug him . He broke down into tears and  kissed Nesmith on the cheek . " I'm sorry if I hurt you. " Shokichi said as he felt arms wrap around him tightly. " No I loved you a lot and I still do .. I just want you  to be happy. You didn't feel happy with me" Nesmith said as Shokichi shook his head.<br/>Takahiro watched as Nesmith let Shokichi go .  He watched Shokichi wipe Nesmith's tears away. " I loved you a lot , I feel like I don't want to be here right now ." Shokichi said as he looked at Nesmith . </p><p>Nesmith let Shokichi sit on his lap and  held him close. " Takahiro, don't depend on others to fix you. You're hurt right now I get that but Shokichi and Nesmith were happy before . You can stay with me for awhile . Let Shokichi go. " Keiji said as he wrapped his arms Takahiro.  Takahiro nodded as Shokichi was walking back over to him . Keiji explained to Shokichi the talk that he and Takahiro had.  Nesmith walked over and hugged Shokichi from behind. <br/>They all began to practice after everything was settled . Shokichi kept looking at Nesmith .  Nesmith felt a hand hold his once the break was announced. "Baby " Nesmith whispered as he saw Shokichi get on his lap .  He looked at Shokichi who was blushing. <br/>"Are you mine ?" Shokichi asked and Nesmith smiled and nodded .  He felt multiple kisses hit his lips and Nesmith smirked. " Bad " Shokichi whispered in Nesmith's ear. They went to an empty room and locked the door . Nesmith watched Shokichi strip down as he took off of his clothes and slammed into Shokichi . He heard moans of his name as Shokichi's cum shot across the room onto a mirror. Nesmith came inside of Shokichi. He pulled out and helped Shokichi get dressed .  Shokichi blushed as he cleaned up the mirror.  <br/>He felt arms wrap around him and felt soft kisses down his neck. " I missed you a lot " He said as Nesmith turned him around.  He rested his head on Nesmuth's chest as he felt a  jacket be wrapped around him .  He walked back to the practice room with Nesmith . " I love you " He whispered into Nesmith's ear . Nesmith watched Shokichi bury his face in his chest while they walked in the room. Shokichi was blushing as Nesmith snuck a kiss.  <br/>They began to practice and Shokichi yawned as he continued. " Nesmith I'm sleepy. " Shokichi said as Nesmith wrapped his arms around him. " Your house or mine? " Nesmith asked even though he knew the answer. Shokichi liked cuddling up to someone and Nesmith was that someone.  <br/>He took Shokichi to his house .He  carried him inside and wondered if he's been sleeping and laid  down with him on the bed . He noticed how Shokichi's breathing calmed down as held him him close. " Nes" He heard Shokichi whisper.  He knew Shokichi loved him a lot .  "Don't leave me ever again." Shokichi said as he began to wake up . " Baby I won't I promise." He said as he laid him on his chest. He gives Shokichi  gentle kisses.</p>

  <p>" You're my baby." Nesmith whispered into Shokichi's ear.  Nesmith kissed Shokichi's blushing cheeks .  He heard a whine and played with Shokichi's hair .  " My Nes-san." Shokichi said as he was attacked with kisses. He just started to cry and hugged Nesmith tight.<br/>" Hey do you feel something for Takahiro? " Nesmith asked . " Yes but he probably doesn't think of me that way. " Shokichi said .  " He does if he got you to work when I left you.  I felt so bad .. Naoto had to coax me with hugs just to get me to practice." Nesmith said .  <br/>Shokichi texted Takahiro something. He read Takahiro's reply out loud and smiled. He went to go see Takahiro after Nesmith told him he'll be there if everything breaks.  He saw Takahiro shaking and ran to hug him . " Keiji said he'd stay with you where'd he go?"  Shokichi asked as he lifted Takahiro. " He went home ." Takahiro whispered.  He felt a tighter hold. " You should think a bit longer... I'm here for you " Takahiro said as he wiped a tear that was going down Shokichi's face . He knew Shokichi was being used and did not like that but he's still hurt himself.  He wants to protect Shokichi. He knew Shokichi loved him as he kissed him multiple times. " Sho-chan I love you too don't worry I'm healing as much you are." He said as Shokichi laid down with him in  his arms . He noticed dark circles under Shokichi's eyes. " Shokichi baby... have been you sleeping? " He asked and Shokichi shook his head.  Shokichi had Takahiro kissing his tears away.  <br/>He liked being called Takahiro's baby even though he never liked being called baby because he usually gets hurt when he called that.  He started to close his eyes slowly as Takahiro sang into his ear . Takahiro heard snores and smiled.</p>

" That felt good " He said as he noticed Takahiro curled up to him. He wanted to be touched by Takahiro more.  </p><p>Takahiro noticed a blush as he  heard Shokichi  beg to be touched more. He took  his boxers off and rode Shokichi's dick slowly as he kissed him deeply. " If your uncomfortable I'll  stop " He whispered in Shokichi's ear as he began to hear Shokichi's moans .  He felt Shokichi release inside him and  pull out . " I love my baby" He whispered  into Shokichi's ear and saw a blush. He was held tightly as he kissed the blushing cheeks. There was love bites down Shokichi's chest. <br/>Shokichi was the Co-leader of Exile instead of Naoto . Naoto dropped the role . He took Takahiro into work with him . He noticed how Takahiro got on his lap fast and held him close. He kissed him quick and they started to practice. "Baby boy come here." Takahiro said as Shokichi came over to him and gave him a kiss. Shokichi's and Takahiro's chemistry as leaders was unmatched.  They practiced  a little bit more . Takahiro ran over to Shokichi and jumped into his arms after they were done.  Shokichi's chin was rested on top of  Takahiro's  head . He liked when Takahiro was cute like this .  He carried him to the car . " I want to stay in your arms a bit longer ."  Takahiro said as he was put down. He felt arms lift him up once he got out of the car and rested his head against Shokichi's chest. He looked at the ring that was slipped on to his finger.  He smiled as he gave Shokichi a kiss and he was laid down .  He noticed Shokichi snuggling up to him. He heard snores a couple minutes and whispered "Thank you baby." He falls asleep.  Shokichi was shaking  and woke up. Takahiro woke up and held Shokichi tightly.</p>

  <p>They both woke up to a sound.  Takahiro  ran to find out what the sound was. Shokichi heard a scream and went down stairs . He faught the person hurting Takahiro. He called the police.<br/>" Shokichi I'm okay calm down"Takahiro said as they watched the person get taken away. Shokichi kissed the top of his head.  Takahiro  hid in his chest. He played with Shokichi's fingers and felt Shokichi's hands trembling. He took him back up to bed.  He watched Shokichi curl up to him . " Don't leave me."Shokichi whispered. <br/>Takahiro knew Shokichi was hurting because of Nesmith repeatedly leaving him . He gave him kisses and wiped tears away.  He knows that Shokichi falls deep in love and that he feels the same. He heard snores and whispered that he loved him. " Takahiro, baby  come here . I love you too ." Shokichi said half asleep as he let Takahiro lay on top of him .  Shokichi rubbed Takahiro's back gently.He fell asleep as soon as Takahiro. They loved each other so much as they shared lazy kisses. " Merry Christmas." Takahiro said  as the kisses down his neck got rougher. He whimpered as he blushed . He moaned as Shokichi moved inside him slowly. He moaned even louder as the thrusts got faster and harder . He came once Shokichi did .  He slapped Shokichi's inner thigh as he moved down to lick the excess cum off Shokichi's dick. " Baby boy  I got you ." Takahiro said as Shokichi whined for more .  He flipped Shokichi over and slammed inside him . He heard whines mixed with whimpers and moans. Shokichi came on the sheets as he felt a hot liquid inside him. Takahiro gave him gentle kisses as he let him snuggle close.  Shokichi liked his gift. Takahiro loved him so much and Shokichi knew that .  He wanted nothing to get in between them .<br/>He carried Shokichi downstairs as he kissed him and sat him down and he started cooking.<br/>He watched Shokichi and sat on his lap.  Feeling a tight grip as he ate, he noticed Shokichi finshed his plate. They did share a plate . He giggled as he felt kisses on his cheek. They slow danced  in kitchen and shared kisses . Shokichi smiled at Takahiro who was snuggled up to to his chest. He wanted to keep him like this forever which will happen. He heard an I love you whispered and he noticed Takahiro looking up at him .

  <p>Shokichi woke up . He was clearly scared as he noticed Takahiro sit up and wrap his arms around Shokichi's waist.  Sweet nothings were whispered in his ear.  He smiled as he calmed down. He felt a kiss to his lips. " Baby lets sleep more." Takahiro said as he watched Shokichi lay back down. They both went back to sleep. Shokichi was snuggled close to Takahiro.  Takahiro tried not to wake Shokichi up when he got up. Shokichi woke up later and felt a body sit on his lap.  He laughed because Takahiro waited to get on his lap.  Takahiro just wanted to stay in his arms arms longer.  Shokichi helped Takahiro heal and  Takahiro helped Shokichi heal.  He asked if Takahiro wanted to stay with him  and be his boyfriend.  Takahiro said yes as he felt lips on his lips.<br/>
They went to work and practiced for awhile . Takahiro noticed Shokichi being upset and pulled him close taking him out of the room. He felt a few kisses  hit his lips . " Baby lets go back ." Takahiro said as they walked back. They went back to practicing. <br/>
Shokichi smiled as he practiced and Takahiro just wanted to hug him. He stopped and Takahiro ran into his arms. He held him close. " So cute" He said as Takahiro hid his face.<br/>
Nesmith was jealous of  Shokichi's relationship because he was still in love with Shokichi. He knew he was getting sick as he felt himself puke. Keiji knew love sickness happened to him . He just didn't know how to fix him . Even Hiro noticed he was getting sicker and sicker.  Shokichi's heart hurt a little bit as he watched Nesmith get worse until he noticed  that he stopped coming in. " Shokichi I know you're hurting because Nesmith is hurting . How do you feel about us taking a break  because you seem to feel something still? " Takahiro asked .  " I want the break for a bit . " Shokichi said as Takahiro gave him a last kiss.<br/>
Shokichi went to Nesmith's house and found him laying in bed .  " Sho come here " He heard him continuously whisper. He finally broke down like he wanted to and Nesmith pulled him into the bed. " Sho baby don't cry." He heard Nesmith say. Nesmith kissed his tears away. He noticed Shokichi's heart stopped for a second  and he rubbed his back softly. " Baby I got you ." Nesmith said. " You have always got me since the beginning." Shokichi said as he felt lips kissed his .<br/>
Nesmith knows he has the actual ring that Shokichi meant to give Takahiro but Shokichi wanted him to keep it. He knew Shokichi would come back. " Don't go. I won't ." Shokichi said as Nesmith squeezed his hand . They fell asleep after awhile . They slept until the next day.</p>

  <p>Shokichi woke up first with arms wrapped around him . He smiled and Nesmith squeezed him tighter. He felt lips against his. <br/>Nesmith smiled as Shokichi got on his lap. " Baby boy I'm here don't worry. " He whispered as he felt Shokichi's grip tighten. He kissed Shokichi's head. He noticed how hurt Shokichi was and choose not leave him alone . He listened to Shokichi explain he how he felt different without him and he kissed his cheek.<br/>" I felt as sick as you did. I just wanted to be left alone but I felt like I had to take care of Takahiro."  He heard Shokichi say as Nesmith sighs. " You helped him though. I know you had sex with him and you were uncomfortable with it." Nesmith said as he wiped Shokichi's tears away. " You're with me now . You're safe. Akira is gone . Takahiro is gone." Nesmith said.  "'Takahiro actually noticed something wrong with our relationship and I noticed it too. You flip other people's situations to make them fit your narrative." Shokichi said as he got up to leave . <br/>He went back to Takahiro's place and laid on the couch in Takahiro's arms. Takahiro held Shokichi tightly.  Shokichi felt soft lips against his temple and tried to smile. " Oh baby don't be sad " Takahiro said and he knew Nesmith did something to make him upset and come back.  " He accused of you trying to hurt me while we were dating." Shokichi said. " Akira is back ."  Takahiro said. " He was just very upset with how he acted before." Takahiro continued.  " You didn't let him in ,did you ?" Shokichi asked and Takahiro shook his head. </p><p>Someone was knocking at the door, it was Akira . Shokichi gave in and let him in.  He looked at Akira and looked down.  Akira watched Shokichi go in his arms. "What happened ?"  Akira asked as he held Shokichi close. " Nesmith just doesn't want to leave him alone.  He .was manipulating the situation saying I didn't love him and he was talking about  you negatively ." Takahiro said .  " I understand what I did was wrong and I wanted to apologize." Akira  said . Shokichi just broke down in Akira's arms. " It's okay don't worry I won't hurt you." Akira whispered in Shokichi"s ear. Shokichi relaxed in Akira's arms. "I'm sorry for hurting both of you." Akira said.  He felt a pair of lips of kiss his arm. " I think we're all being set up." Takahiro said as he watched Shokichi snuggle Akira.  " But by who? " Akira asked.  " I don't know but Shokichi missed you."Takahiro said as he wondered if Shokichi has actually slept. <br/>Akira sat down with Shokichi in his lap falling asleep slowly. He gave Shokichi a kiss on the forehead. " Sleep Sho. I got you . " He whispered.  " Thank you Takahiro for taking care of him." He said .  Takahiro smiled .  " I think Nesmith would set something like this up with help." Takahiro said as he kissed Shokichi's cheek . Shokichi woke up on Akira's lap and blushed. "He wants kisses from you." Takahiro said and watched Akira give Shokichi kisses. “ I love you.” Shokichi whispered. “ Happy New Year” Akira said.  Takahiro gave  Akira’s cheek a kiss.

  <p>" Ryohei wake up." Shokichi said as he shook him . They both hurry upstairs to see Takahiro crying.  Shokichi looks at Akira and watches Takahiro hug him as he looks down. He felt bad and started to cry. " I should stop going  back and fourth to people. " Shokichi said as he left to go to the studio and sleep there.  He unlocked the studio door once he got there and laid on the couch . He cried until he fell asleep. </p><p>Meanwhile  at the house , Akira and Takahiro argue about who is going to get him.  He sleeps until the next morning or until Elly notices and tries to wake him up. He rambled to Elly about how he felt. He noticed the practice room had the guys in it and he didn't want to be seen like this. Tetsuya saw him out of the corner of his eye and pulled him inside.  He noticed Takahiro's worried expression and was pulled into a hug. " I was worried about you." He heard Takahiro say.  He just broke down into tears after everyone except Takahiro left . He felt lips kissing his tears away.  "Elly told me what you said." Takahiro said .  He smiled shyly as he hid his face in Takahiro's neck .  " I love you Takahiro but I don't know how to express that and I'm scared that I'll lose you." Shokichi said as he noticed Takahiro's grip tighten. " Don't worry baby ." Takahiro whispered in his ear .  Once they got home they cuddled together. Akira was gone. The jealousy was over .<br/>Shokichi held onto to Takahiro tightly curling up around him. "Happy New Year baby." Takahiro said and he hugged him tightly. " Never do that again. You scared me " Takahiro continued as he felt a kiss. He gave Shokichi multiple kisses.  <br/>Shokichi sat up and Takahiro  sat on his lap. He smiled at the person with a head on his chest. Takahiro really loved Shokichi. Shokichi loved him too and they helped each other heal. He let Takahiro sleep on his lap as he slowly laid down.  " Oh baby you're okay." He  whispered knowing Takahiro was worried. He fell asleep with Takahiro in his arms . Takahiro woke up a couple hours later kissing the lips of the sleeping man below him. He watched Shokichi open his eyes. " Baby " He said as he played with Shokichi's hair and he held him close.  He kisses the blushing cheeks and then his lips felt a kiss. <br/>They went back to work the next day even though Shokichi clearly did not want to go. Shokichi was in the studio recording when Takahiro came in and sat on the couch .He watched Shokichi walk towards him and hugged him tightly.  " Baby I'm here." He said as he held him close. He kisses him softly as he looks down at him. He sat Shokichi down on his lap and felt arms wrap around him. Shokichi felt lips on his neck and he whined and clung to Takahiro tighter.</p>

  <p>" Takahiro I'm not in the mood . Stop it." Shokichi said as he broke free from his grasp .  " This relationship isn't really going to work is it?" Takahiro asked as Shokichi walked into an empty practice room and started to cry.  Takahiro  left the building for a bit and Nesmith looked in the room and he was worried. He knew Shokichi felt heartache. Shokichi told Takahiro how he felt and he felt bad for hurting him. Shokichi stayed in the room for a little bit longer  and Nesmith finally walked in .  Shokichi felt arms wrap around him and turned around . " Nesmith.." Shokichi whispered as he blushed and looked down. He  felt fingers wipe his tears away.<br/>Nesmith just held him close. He noticed how quick Shokichi calmed but if he did let him go he'd start crying again.  Takahiro watched through the glass and walked away.   Nesmith noticed Takahiro but didn't get mad . He gave  Shokichi a few kisses and sat down with him in his lap rocking him . " Stay " He heard Shokichi whisper.  " I'm not leaving please don't leave me." He whispered as Shokichi curled up in his chest.  Shokichi felt a kiss on the top of his head and smiled.  Nesmith carried  him to his car. He whined when he sat down . Nesmith thought that was cute and started to drive .<br/>Shokichi was asleep and once Nesmith was parked he climbed over so Shokichi can hold him. Nesmith was carried in and felt lips kiss his.  Nesmith was sat down and Shokichi hugged him with a sense of fear. He looked at his phone for a second and saw a message from Takahiro .  He read and let Shokichi see the message.  He followed Shokichi upstairs  and let him  lay down on top of his chest.   He rubbed Shokichi's  back as he cries. He never has seen Shokichi so broken before. " Nes" He heard  Shokichi whisper. <br/>He wondered how Shokichi was so genuine on his feelings and Takahiro wanted him back after he decided to leave him there crying like that.  He knew Shokichi didn't want Takahiro and that the relationship was based on guilt.  " I'm here for you no matter how much I mess everything we had up . I still love you." He said as Shokichi gave him a kiss . He knew a kiss sealed everything but that Shokichi needed heal. Shokichi has been used by two people but Nesmith was his first love .   He felt his kisses get deepened and moans as his ass gets squeezed. He pulls away and smiles and rests his head on Nesmith's chest. He falls asleep slowly.  He clings to Nesmith tightly so he doesn't leave. Nesmith plays with Shokichi's hair and he himself falls asleep.</p>

  <p>Nesmith woke up to hearing a cry and  he hugged Shokichi tightly. Shokichi woke up and a few tears went down his face. Nesmith kissed the tears away.  "I missed you" He heard Shokichi whisper.  He smiled .<br/>
Shokichi's heart stopped beating fast when calmed down.  He felt Nesmith rub his chest.  He played with Nesmith's hand.  Nesmith got up and lifted Shokichi up and spun him around. He felt Shokichi's grip tighten.  " I'm sorry if I scared you. " He said as he heard a giggle. He kissed him quickly.  Shokichi walked with Nesmith to the door and it was Takahiro. " Please say what your really up to, Nesmith.  I don't like seeing Shokichi hopefully in love like this ." He said .  " Sho I love you but it really is time to let you go because I've been using you . Takahiro and Akira noticed . Takahiro and Akira were being my test subjects and I didn't want to hurt them either." Nesmith said. " You got Takahiro to hurt me! You made Akira lose his job! Hiro didn't know about this!  " Shokichi yelled as he cried and shook .  He fell to the floor as Akira walked in. He noticed Shokichi on the floor , crying. " You've hurt us enough." Akira said as he tried to get Shokichi off the floor . He held Shokichi close. <br/>
" Elly I want Elly " Shokichi said . Takahiro took him to Elly's place. Elly hugs Shokichi tightly and notices him break down when Takahiro goes away. The rest of the members were over and saw Shokichi come in the room looking like a crying mess. Shokichi tried to calm down to say what happened but Elly read the texts as Shokichi was snuggled up against him. " Takahiro was helping him cope and saw how hurt he was and Takahiro didn't mean to hurt him." Elly continued as Omi balled his fist and Naoto was noticeably angry. Naoto kissed Shokichi's head.  " Takahiro should know better , he should of stopped  when he noticed him crying and bleeding.  Atsushi told me what happened.  " Naoto said .  " I know but Exile might have to be over after this gets out." Elly said. Ryuji gets on Shokichi's lap and clings to him . Kenjiro just acts confused.  " Ryuji I'll be fine baby . " Shokichi whispered into Ryuji's ear and held him tightly.   Elly kissed Shokichi's cheek.   "  He's falling asleep.  Ryuji calmed him .  " Naoto said as Naoki wiped a tear off of Shokichi's cheek.  Ryuji gets off of Shokichi's lap and leaves with the rest and<br/>
Shokichi starts to shake and Elly takes him upstairs and sets him on the bed . He begs Elly to stay and cuddle him.<br/>
Elly climbs in the bed and wrapped his arms around him. He's never seen Shokichi hurt this bad .  He knew Akira was sorry from the texts Shokichi got but Akira was the one set up just as bad. He knew Akira was genuine and felt so bad that he didn't really want to come back to Exile and was loosing money. He knew Shokichi felt something between him and Akira.  He brought him to Akira's house once he woke up. " Ryohei " He heard Shokichi whisper and Akira. He noticed how Akira wrapped his arms around Shokichi.<br/>
Shokichi  looks at Akira as Elly leaves. " I promise I won't hurt you , I loved you. I was genuine about it." Akira  said as he brought  Shokichi  inside.  He watched Shokichi break down and held him close, rocking him. " Ryohei. " He heard Shokichi whisper in a broken voice as he  kissed his head. " Baby I got you .  I tried my best to protect you. I feel so bad . I had to leave because I couldn't stop it . Hiro tried to stop it . "  He said  as Shokichi wiped his tears away . " You were drugged." Shokichi said as he kissed Akira's lips softly.   " You're fine now " Shokichi said as he laid on top of Akira's chest.   Shokichi knew that he got through to him when he was drugged and that he was scared .  Akira was holding Shokichi tightly.  "Ryohei I'm okay don't cry and I'm here now . Bubba don't cry." He heard Shokichi whisper in his ear. Shokichi was curled up on Akira's chest .  They both fell asleep. <br/>
They woke up the next morning .  Shokichi didn't want to let Akira go .  "  Not letting go Bubba." Shokichi whispered .<br/>
Akira's heart melted when he heard that whispered and  gave him a few kisses. He saw a blush. He knew Shokichi wanted  to not go into work but made him go anyway.  Shokichi was  walking behind him and Hiro wanted to talk to them about what happened and Shokichi held Akira's hand tightly the whole time. " You're strong Shokichi. It's okay if you want to quit. ' " Atsushi said as Akira looked at him . " Akira you're also strong . You're helping him heal and Takahiro really did mess him up. " Atsushi continued.  " The juniors noticed the pain , Taiki and Alan mostly and tried to think of things to help you guys." Matsu  said.  "They got everyone in the company  except for Takahiro and Nesmith to write in this book." Makidai said  as he handed the book to Akira.</p>

  <p>Akira and Shokichi went to the meeting room and looked at the book. Akira let Shokichi be on his lap and wrapped an arm around him. He felt a quick kiss and looked through the book as  Shokichi teared up and pointed to a message .  Akira noticed who it was and smiled .  He noticed Shokichi getting sleepy and let him fall asleep.  He smiled looking down at the person who was asleep in his arms , wrapping his jacket around him , carrying him to  the car. He sets him in the car and then gets in to drive.  He starts to drive. Once he parks , he carries Shokichi inside .  " Ryohei .." Shokichi whispered. " Yes baby ?"

He sat down with Shokichi on his lap , wrapping a blanket around him. Shokichi woke up a couple hours later  giving Akira a few kisses.  The kisses got rougher as Akira slipped his tongue in Shokichi's mouth. Akira knew Shokichi wanted more. " Are you sure?" Akira asked  as Shokichi nodded and stripped his clothes off . Akira slipped the boxers down and inserted his dick in Shokichi's ass. Shokichi moved his hips slowly as he gave Akira kisses. The movement became faster and Akira pinned Shokichi to the couch.  Moans were heard and they both came. Akira was giving Shokichi soft kisses down his cheek and cleaned him up.  He wrapped himself around Shokichi protectively . Shokichi knew that Akira was the one  who needed protecting more then him . He knew when Akira had that out of character melt down to him during the test and he really wanted to stay with him.

I wanted to stay with you since the test but I was scared and I was already crying when I left you and I wanted to stay.  Takahiro wasn't drugged when he did what he did . He just didn't stop even though he wanted to  but he felt something from it. He felt bad after getting  beaten up. "  He heard Shokichi say and  played with his hair. He knew Shokichi felt something from him  that made him want to stay. He kissed Shokichi's cheek softly.  He wiped Shokichi's tear away and took up him upstairs.</p>

  <p>Shokichi was curled up to Akira's side.  Akira still has a job because Hiro told him he can come back anytime.  He  kissed the top of Shokichi's head .  He knew they were healing each other.  The scars they have are both mental and physical. Akira really wanted to protect Shokichi. He noticed how Shokichi clung to him . " Don't be scared baby I got you." He whispered as Shokichi gave him a kiss.  Akira was worried about Shokichi since the day in the rain . He took the blame for everything even tho he didn't even set it up. He starts to cry . Shokichi nuzzles his nose against Akira's cheek in an attempt to calm him down. He feels a tight grip from shaking hands . " Ryohei don't cry you're okay. I'm okay."

" He heard a Akira  whisper. He started to cry as he clung to Akira tightly. They both hurt and Shokichi knew that . <br/>Akira played with his hair and just let him cry. He missed Shokichi in his arms but didn't like to see him cry.  He started to pepper him with kisses. He heard a giggle  and  Shokichi  hid his face in his chest. Akira thought this was cute and carried Shokichi downstairs. He noticed Shokichi bury his face into his  side when he was put down.  He cooked once he was let go.  Shokichi pouted as he ate .  " Come here baby ." Akira said as he  watched  Shokichi  get on his lap once he finished . He kissed the top of Shokichi's head. " Cutie ." He said and  Shokichi blushed .

Shokichi pulled Akira's hand and received a kiss to relax him . They both went to practice and Naoto noticed how happy Shokichi was . They both would never let Exile break due to petty behavior. Akira looks less depressed. Elly was right to Shokichi  him to Akira since he and Akira had a connection.

  <p>" Did Takahiro ever psychically hurt you?" Shokichi  asked and Akira let out a yes.   He  knew Akira would never fight back  if Takahiro ever tried to fight him .  He saw Takahiro walk up to them.  " Yes I did psychically hurt him. " Takahiro said feeling guilty because he knew hurt Akira badly.  Shokichi started to shake as he felt anger and Atsushi was watching from a distance.  Shokichi held Akira close. Takahiro broke down  in front of them and apologized for everything he's done even though the damage is done . Atsushi never knew Takahiro had that much emotion in him .<br/>Atsushi can tell that Takahiro has been crying for a long time.  Shokichi's look softened as Akira  looked at Takahiro  having a break down. Both of them knew he was hurt too .  Shokichi watched Akira get off his lap and let Takahiro get on .  " Takahiro baby shh." Shokichi whispered  and he knew that Takahiro heard him cry that  day and couldn't stop because he was scared. Atsushi walked up to them and asked Takahiro a couple questions. Shokichi knew Atsushi meant no harm but the questions were hurting Takahiro more . Naoto was watching everything and he knew by body language that Takahiro was truly upset and Nesmith fucked them all up .  Atsushi walked away and knew Takahiro was in great hands. Akira noticed how Takahiro moved to his lap and  held him tightly. Both Shokichi and Akira kissed the top of his head .  " Takahiro you're okay shh ." Akira said as he rubbed his back and Shokichi snuggled  up to him . Takahiro went back inside once he was calm enough and Shokichi went back to Akira's lap .  " Sho baby , you're only mine."Akira whispered into Shokichi's ear.   Shokichi felt a kiss to his lips. He smiled and hugged Akira tightly. Akira carried him back in the practice room. He noticed Shokichi's face was buried in his chest . Takahiro looked at them and mouthed " Thank you" as he looked noticeably upset again. Shokichi got out of Akira's arms and looked at Takahiro's face it was slightly bruised under the make up . He wiped the tear that was going down Takahiro's face away. Takahiro  is regretting what he has done and is wondering why Shokichi's so forgiving. He's trying to forget.  He  feels his knees give out and  Shokichi catches him .  Akira calls the ambulance. Shokichi held Takahiro close to him. The nurse asked  if he was getting sleep. Shokichi noticed the lies as Atsushi answered bo he hasn't as he came in .  The nurse laid him in the back. Akira said Shokichi can go with him. Shokichi got in the ambulance. He held Takahiro's hand tightly. The ambulance was on the way to the hospital. Takahiro woke up once  he was in the hospital and Shokichi looked at him.  " Takahiro I'm so worried about you." Shokichi said as he kissed his forehead. Shokichi looked at the pout.  " Shokichi .. " Takahiro  said. Shokichi  sat on the edge of bed and Akira walked in. " We're glad that your okay . " Akira said.  Shokichi looked at  Takahiro super worried. Takahiro really wanted to cuddle with him and Akira nodded  letting him  pull Shokichi close to him. "Baby I'm okay  shh."  Takahiro whispered into Shokichi's ear.  He felt a kiss to his forehead. " Takahiro you're ready to be discharged " A nurse shouted.  Takahiro let Shokichi lift him up. " I don't want to leave you alone Takahiro but Akira.." Shokichi said. " I think your heart decided that it didn't want me but you felt bad  and it's cute but don't let that  fog your thoughts. " Akira said. Shokichi nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>Shokichi looked at the man clutching his shirt.  " Takahiro were you broken hearted?" He asked and Takahiro answered yes as he kissed him.  Shokichi's heart was beating fast.  Takahiro was asleep in the car and Akira dropped them both off. Once they got inside, Shokichi sat Takahiro down on the bed .  He laid down curling up around him. He felt a hand wipe his tear away. Takahiro knew something Shokichi didn't.  He know that Shokichi loved him through the pain. Both of them wanted to quit Exile because they've went through so much but they've put so much into it that they can't . Takahiro's arms wrapped around Shokichi's waist and he kissed him. He heard a whispered "I love you."  Takahiro's heart melted.  He let Shokichi cry as he held him close. Sometimes people just need to cry is what Takahiro thought as he soothingly rubbed Shokichi's back. <br/>Seeing Shokichi hurt like this hurt Takahiro.  Shokichi wiped Takahiro's tears away. He kissed him gently as Takahiro  deepened the kiss. " You'll never loose me ." He said in between kisses. " I never said I would ." Takahiro said .  Shokichi whimpered as Takahiro's lips went down his body.  His boxers were wet with a white liquid.  Takahiro smirked . He slipped off Shokichi's boxers watching Shokichi get on top of him and adjusted himself . Takahiro moaned as Shokichi's hips started to move and thrusted hard into Shokichi's ass. " I missed you so much baby" Takahiro whispered as he harshly kissed him . Takahiro released inside of Shokichi's ass. He heard a moan as he pressed Shokichi into the mattress and roughly thrusted into him . Shokichi was shaking really bad as he came on the sheets . He felt Takahiro release inside him a couple times and whined softly. " Takahiro I wanna cuddle "  he whined as he caught his breath. He felt Takahiro  pull him close and buried his face in his chest.<br/>Takahiro held Shokichi's hand tightly as he gave him gentle kisses. They were still healing and they didn't want to be apart.Shokichi noticed that Takahiro still had the ring he gave him on . He smiled. " I'll never take off this ring" He heard Takahiro say.</p><p>Shokichi squeezed Takahiro's hand. Takahiro kissed him softly. He heard snores from the man cuddled up to him. He slowly fell asleep himself. They woke up a few hours later. Shokichi sat up as and Takahiro crawled into his lap. “ Baby .” He heard  Takahiro say as he felt arms wrap around him. He kissed Takahiro’s head .  “ I’m here Takahiro don’t worry I’m not leaving.”  He said as Takahiro’s grip got tighter.  He carried Takahiro down stairs. They were both naked. Shokichi blushed when his cheek was kissed. They got dressed after eating.  Shokichi and Takahiro were working separately today and Shokichi’s nerves weren’t at ease when they separated. He heard a scream and runs to it. He realizes it was  Takahiro’s voice . Takahiro was getting beaten up and tried to defend himself and Shokichi took a punch to the ribs after he hovered over him. Atsushi ran immediately in to stop it.</p>

" Takahiro said as he laid next to him.  He let Takahiro snuggle up to his side ,  he knew that Takahiro cared and was worried . He felt a kiss placed on his ribs. He played with Takahiro's hair. He was breathing slowly.  The nurse noticed that Takahiro was sleeping next to him and told Shokichi that he was okay to go home.<br/>Shokichi picked up Takahiro up and felt a face bury in his chest.   He drove them home and sat Takahiro on his lap once they got home.  Takahiro slowly woke up. His face was red and he asked  Shokichi if he was okay. " I'm fine baby ." Shokichi said as he kissed the blushing cheeks.  Shokichi  left a love bite on Takahiro's neck. He felt Takahiro's hold get tighter and lips go against his injury .  He smiled as he rubbed Takahiro's back . Takahiro got off Shokichi's lap. He looked at the pouting face then snuggled to his side.  He kissed the pout  then pouted himself.

" I'm going in tomorrow " he  heard Shokichi say as his back was soothingly rubbed. " No you're not ." Takahiro said as he kissed Shokichi's chest.  He felt the hold get tighter, and looked up at the pouting face.  Shokichi went upstairs and started crying.

Shokichi started to calm down as he turned around and felt lips go against his. Takahiro got Shokichi the pain killers. He heard a whine and thought it was cute.  He snuggled up to Shokichi's side after Shokichi took the medicine. He felt a few quick kisses and blushed. Shokichi only made him feel this way .<br/>He felt a hand rub his back and started to fall asleep . Shokichi fell asleep.   <br/>Takahiro heard something at the door and went to investigate. He noticed Akira was all bloody and standing in the doorway . " I don't think Nesmith is doing all of this. He called me for something and what happened to me was after .."  Akira  said as Shokichi came down stairs.  " Ryohei what happened? " Shokichi asked as he felt pain from his ribs because it slightly hard to breathe.  " I was attacked " Akira said  as he helped Shokichi to the couch.</p>

  <p>Nesmith noticed Shokichi fell asleep curled up against him . He took a picture and gave him a kiss on the top of his head. Shokichi stirred  a bit and Nesmith rubbed his chest softly.  He felt his hand get held and watched the eyes open slowly. He sits up and Shokichi gets on his on his lap.  His arms instinctively go around him. " Nes don't let go ." He heard Shokichi whisper and knew  he did the right thing by staying. Hiro also did the right thing by making their schedules a little bit shorter. Shokichi fell back asleep on Nesmith's lap hugging him tightly like a teddy bear.<br/>
Nesmith  thought this was cute, wrapping him in a blanket. " I love you so much ." He heard Shokichi whisper. He kissed Shokichi's cheek softly as he heard snores. He set Shokichi down to go to the bathroom. When he came back , Shokichi was curled up in a ball. Nesmith curled around him . He fell asleep.<br/>
Shokichi woke up a few hours later and saw arms around him giving the arm a kiss since he didn't want to wake up the man wrapped around him. He felt lips kiss his, the grip got tighter around him and then he was let go . He pouted as he kissed back. " Come here . " Nesmith said and he knew Nesmith was tired of his issue .  " Nesmith , I know you are tired of my issues." Shokichi said as he moved into in his arms. " It is tiring  but I want to help you through anything. We're a couple which means we help each other."  Nesmith said .  Shokichi kissed him softly as he moved closer.  He wrapped his arms around the other .   He  noticed the bite marks on his chest and blushed. " I'm only yours don't worry ." Shokichi said as he looked at Nesmith.<br/>
Nesmith looked at him as he kissed his chest.  " I actually wish we were wolves . What if the dream is telling us that we are and you're scared? You don't  need to be."  Nesmith said  .<br/>
" We might be." Shokichi said . " Takahiro had a weird scent on him. That wasn't clone. " Nesmith said. " I'm sure you are being silly." Shokichi said. " But Sho there's weird tension like we want to transform but we  are scared." Nesmith said. " I've felt this tension but it doesn't feel real. ." Shokichi said as he tries to transforms into a wolf.  " Baby it wasn't successful. " Nesmith said as he kissed him softly. Shokichi was wrapped in a blanket while he was on Nesmith's lap. He turned into a wolf  while sleeping. Nesmith noticed as he petted the fur. He noticed how Shokichi was curled up.<br/>
They’ve been through a lot and Nesmith knew that. Shokichi woke up and stirred in his new form . “ Puppy shh I got you .” Nesmith said. Shokichi turned back into a human .  “ Well .. I was a wolf. “ Shokichi said as he kissed Nesmith. “ You looked so beautiful.” Nesmith said as Shokichi blushed .</p><p>“ I would of screwed you even if that’s illegal . “ Nesmith said as he bit Shokichi’s neck harshly and sucked on it. “ We could be wolves for that” Shokichi said as he moaned .

  <p>Nesmith got up  and left the room for a bit and Shokichi turned into his wolf form and walked around . He barked frantically.  In his head  he thinks someone is going to hurt him.  Nesmith noticed how frantic Shokichi is and goes to calm him down.   He hears a gun and he was shot through the window.  Nesmith took Shokichi to the hospital. He waited for hours and Shokichi noticed the tears . He was in his human form. " I'll be fine .. we have to find out who did it. " Shokichi said . Shokichi let Nesmith cuddle up to him . " Takahiro maybe knew something.." Nesmith said. " He's the one who caused this .. I saw him."Shokichi said .  He was told he could go home and Nesmith drove him home. Nesmith  carried him inside. "Takahitro drop the gun." Nesmith said as he called the police.  Shokichi was shaking. He growled moving back as he transformed into a wolf . " Puppy go to the bed ." Nesmith whispered and Shokichi curled up on the bed. He heard a gun shot. "No .. " Shokichi thought  as he rushed back downstairs and saw Nesmith on the ground . The ambulance didn't make it in time.  <br/>Keiji followed the sirens  and saw Shokichi breaking down. " He's dead .. why wasn't it me?" Shokichi said as keiji looked at him. " You shouldn't say that ..He tried to protect you." Keiji said as he pulled him close. " I miss him " Shokichi said as Keiji played with his hair.  Keiji kissed his head. He brought him to Elly's house. Naoto looked at how broken Shokichi was and hugged him tightly. Elly heard what everyone else heard.  "Nesmith is dead ." Shokichi said and he broke down. Elly was trying to comfort him.  "Takahiro is far away.. Nesmith did what he needed to protect you ."  Naoto said . <br/>Akira was trying to call Shokichi's phone he was really worried. He finally called Elly to check on Shokichi . He told Elly he really didn't know that Takahiro would of done that. Shokichi noticed fear in Akira's voice.  Takahiro was hurting him .  Shokichi started crying.  Akira said he wished he was there with Shokichi. He came over right away. " Shokichi  I'm here for you."Akira said as he wrapped his arms around him . He felt the grip around him get tighter. He noticed that Shokichi  was still crying. He's glad that Takahiro's gone but Nesmith being gone is something new. Seeing Shokichi like this hurt him and he kissed the top of his head as he cried himself.  "Ryohei don't cry.. you didn't know ." Shokichi said  as he looked up at him . Akira took Shokichi home with him. He let him curl up to him and gave him a kiss once they were in bed.  " Shh baby I'm here and Nesmith is here ." Akira says as he points up. Shokichi smiles knowing that Nesmith trusts Akira with heart but he'll have to get used to this . Akira is  taking this slowly so he hurt either of them.  They kiss passionately for awhile and they fall asleep.</p>

  <p>Shokichi wakes up .  " Bubba wake up." He whispered as he shook Akira .   He turns into a wolf and  let's Akira see. Akira pets him and lets him curl up to him . He turns back into a human. Akira knew they were both safe but he knew it was the end of Exile. He honestly wanted Exile to end but not this way. Shokichi saw Akira cry. Both of them knew Nesmith is watching. Shokichi got a call on his phone . It was the hospital saying that Nesmith is alive.  Akira heard and  was happy but he wanted to know for how much longer. He and Shokichi went to visit. Shokichi looked at Nesmith with tears in his eyes .   He felt a hand hold his . " Shokichi don't cry I'm okay.  I just wanted to protect you." Nesmith said as he tried to sit up.  " No no lay down . Takahiro's gone." Shokichi said as Akira hugged him from behind. "That's good. Akira if  I don't make it , please take care of Shokichi and love him well." Nesmith said.  " Nes you'll make it, I know it." Shokichi said.  He felt tears go down his face as Akira took him out of the room .  He held on to Akira tightly. Nurses rushed into Nesmith's room. The machine was beeping and Shokichi just broke down , Akira just held him.  " He was hurt way too bad  to recover , he wanted to talk to you one last time . "  Akira  said as he rocked Shokichi back and forth. Shokichi tried to calm down when he whispered I love you. He tried to calm his breath since he's still hurt. <br/>Akira took him to the car and took him home . He carried the sleeping Shokichi in and cried  . <br/>" Ryohei don't cry  we're strong." He heard Shokichi say as he sat down with him on his lap.  He felt Shokichi kiss his tears away.  " Sho chan I love you so much . I promise not to hurt you." Akira said and Shokichi's grip became  tighter. " I love you too Ryo-san." He heard him whisper.  Their friend and Shokichi's first love died right in front of them and Exile is ruined . Shokichi felt a couple of kisses hit his lips. He knows Akira's love is genuine. <br/>Akira felt Shokichi grind  against him . " Are you sure your ready ?" Akira asked and Shokichi  whined  a yes.  He stripped Shokichi and himself. He slammed into Shokichi moving fast as he heard moans. Shokichi felt pain and pleasure and noticed Akira  stopped  and wiped his tears away. He noticed Akira going slow as he moaned Akira's name into his ear.  He felt cum release inside him  as he released on the couch.  He was carried  upstairs to the bed and kissed the man carrying him softly.   " I love you baby ." Akira whispered into his ear.  Shokichi had a blanket wrapped around him and snuggled close to Akira's side  wrapping his arms around him.  Akira thought this reaction was cute and assured Shokichi that he was going nowhere.</p>

Shokichi fell asleep as he  cuddled up to Akira . " You're my  baby " Akira whispered as Shokichi smiled and felt a cloth wiping him off.  Akira noticed that he was in Shokichi's arms and buried his face in Shokichi's chest. Once  Shokichi woke up he noticed Akira was asleep curled up in his chest . He went back to sleep . Akira woke up in Shokichi's arms and  shyly hugged him . Shokichi  found the interaction adorable and kissed him. <br/>He felt lips kiss his and answered his phone .  It was Tetsuya crying. Akira knows that Tetsuya likes Shokichi a lot .

He  calmed down while Shokichi kissed him gently.  He heard Shokichi  speak  as he held his arm tightly  " I'm never going to leave  you, don't worry even Nesmith is protecting you ."  Shokichi said as he kissed his neck gently.  " I know we both loved him . I shouldn't have done what I what did." Takahiro said  as he watched Shokichi tear up.

" He's scared to talk about what happened with someone else that's not me." Shokichi said. " He's going to hurt himself again if he doesn't get help." Tetsuya said. " Ryo ?

Once he got stitches and was somewhat awake , Shokichi walked in the room.  Takahiro tried to get up and Shokichi held his hand telling him to stay down. Akira walked in the room and asked who hurt Takahiro because he was close to dying. " A random man tried to have sex with me when the broke in and I fought him off and almost died." Takahiro cried as Shokichi squeezed his hand. Akira's heart stopped and tried to get him to describe the man . Akira brought Shokichi outside and explained that Takahiro's description fit Tetsuya.  " Keiji must know something because he told him to come to me but Tetsuya told a fabricated story to me." He said as Shokichi called Keiji and told him where Takahiro was.  " He was the one telling Takahiro to hurt me " Shokichi told Keiji and Akira . " Takahiro and I's arguments never get physical."

" Baby I'm going to be okay." Takahiro whispered into Shokichi's ear and saw Shokichi's face light up.  Shokichi fell asleep  in Takahiro's arms while kissing him. Takahiro held him tightly while falling asleep himself. They woke up a couple hours later.  Shokichi couldn't help himself to kiss Takahiro's chest. Takahiro got up and  and  went to the bathroom. He really wants to go home and asked the nurse. The nurse got him discharged since they're were no other problems. He walked out with Shokichi clung to him . Shokichi drove them home. Takahiro was asleep in the passenger seat and got carried inside.  He opened his eyes. " Can I stay in your arms longer ?" He asked with a  pout and Shokichi gave in .

He felt a finger wipe the tear going down his face away.<br/>Akira pulled Shokichi into  the hallway ask him questions. Akira is questioning Takahiro's motives . He can sense Shokichi's mental distress so could Tetsuya. He was trying to save Shokichi from getting hurt again. He took Shokichi away from the hospital so they could talk alone. He knew Shokichi didn't want to be with Takahiro. He let him cry in his arms .  " I miss Tetsuya. I wish we weren't so quick to blame him. Takahiro's mental mind games are hurting me." Shokichi said as Akira explained that the didn't kick out Tetsuya. He brought him back to his place. Tetsuya noticed Shokichi's scarred and instantly hugs him tightly.  He was checking Shokichi for bruises. " Tetsuya , he wasn't hurt . He's just upset. " Akira said as he kissed Shokichi's cheek. Akira saw what Tetsuya was trying to do and Shokichi didn't want the interaction. He watched Shokichi shut down and tried to pull him away.  Akira's grip tightened around Shokichi's waist.  He told Tetsuya to get out and let a face bury into his chest. Shokichi was crying hard  and Akira's eyes softened once he looked down at Shokichi. They've helped each other through everything. Akira knows better not to let Shokichi go until he's done crying.  He feels a finger wipe one of his tears away. " I just want people to leave us alone. I didn't know Nesmith was cheating on  you and that Takahiro is crazy. I did not know anything about the plan but I was forced to go with it." He said as Shokichi looked at him . " Ryo you shouldn't of . It hurt both of us. " He heard Shokichi say as a kiss went on his cheek. Shokichi giggled as his lips were kissed.  " I know I shouldn't have ,it was to protect you .

Shokichi sat up slowly and Akira noticed a bruise on the left side of his face. " Did Tetsuya ever hit you ?"  He heard Akira ask and nodded.  " Did Takahiro ever hit you ?" Akira asked and Shokichi shook his head. Akira knew Takahiro meant no harm but  had to keep them away from each other because Tetsuya would try to harm them both.  <br/>Akira remembered  Hiro telling him that Shokichi was loyal Takahiro even he was hurt by him to show Takahiro that he was strong  and to try to tell Takahiro to move from the past.  " Do you still love Takahiro?" Akira asked. " Yes I do . I just want to know if he's alright."  Shokichi said as he cried into Akira's chest. "He's going to be fine." He said as he took Shokichi back to Takahiro. " Shokichi" Takahiro said as he cried. Shokichi got into the bed. " Baby don't cry." Shokichi whispered . Akira left with a smile knowing he did the right thing. Shokichi felt arms wrap around him tightly. He smiled as a kiss hit his lips .  Takahiro yawned softly. He noticed Shokichi was falling asleep.  " I'm guessing you had no sleep. Baby sleep I'll be here." Takahiro whispered in his ear.  They both fell asleep.

Shokichi's eyes opened as kisses  were being given.  He noticed Takahiro was shyly hiding his face. He whined .  " Babyyyyy." Takahiro heard in a whine and kissed the man holding him again and again . His head hurt slightly and Shokichi gave him medicine. He felt his tears being wiped away.  " Don't cry . Im here ."  Shokichi said as he felt a tight squeeze.  <br/>Shokichi noticed Takahiro was getting headaches strong enough to the point where he had to lay down. He put them in the tub and started to wash Takahiro. He noticed how Takahiro snuggled close as he was being clean and there was more noticeable bruises on his body that are healing.  Takahiro yelped when his thigh was being washed . Shokichi lifted Takahiro out of the tub . He called Akira once he got Takahiro out of the tub and dressed .  " Takahiro was attacked more then just the head ." He said to Akira in a worried tone . Akira came by and looked at Takahiro and was visibly angry. Takahiro was hugged tightly as Akira explained that he wasn't mad at him. He felt Shokichi kiss his head then went to talk to Akira.</p>

  <p>Takahiro looked at Elly and let Shokichi go. " T-Takahiro are you really letting me go ? I wanna be in your arms." Shokichi said as he broke down. Takahiro slapped him without impulse .  Elly jumped in between them . " Shokichi doesn't deserve the way you are treating him. He's been hurt just as much as you have. " Elly said as he watched Shokichi burry his face into his chest.  " Takahiro do you really love me?" Shokichi asked and Takahiro shook his head. Shokichi's tears are going down his face. He collapsed onto the floor . Elly called  an ambulance and went with Shokichi . Hoping he wakes up. He texts Naoto to tell him what happened . Naoto was visibly shaken up by the call when he got  to the hospital.  He rushed to see Shokichi and Shokichi was awake. Naoto kissed his forehead.  " You worried me" Naoto said.  Shokichi was crying as Elly held his hand. Naoto looked at how hurt he was. " I warned you about him." Elly said as he felt a squeeze to his hand . Then Taiki came in the room. Shokichi noticed how shaken up Taiki was.   " Taiki come here." Shokichi said softly. He noticed how Taiki laid in his arms. " Shokichi stop hurting yourself by being around people who don't care about you." Taiki said as he kissed Shokichi's cheek.   Shokichi held him tightly. " Taiki's right, you need be around people who care about you."  Naoto said. " Baby your okay . I'm here I got you. " Taiki whispered into Shokichi's ear.   "I don't want anyone else hurt,  it's my fault everyone is  worried over me." Shokichi said as he nuzzled his face into Taiki's chest. " it's not your fault , everything fell when Nesmith passed away." Naoto said . " Everyone in the company wants you to recover well even Takahiro, even though he himself  isn't all that well mentally either. He does love you . He just wants to recover from everything before continuing anything with you. He's scared to leave you alone. "Elly said . " Yeah some of my panic attacks do make me feel immobile and fall down ." Shokichi said .  " He's really worried about you ." Naoto said .  Shokichi answered the phone as he heard Takahiro try not to cry.  " Hey baby don't cry. I'll be okay and back to you soon . I promise." Shokichi said as Takahiro brusts into tears and kept saying sorry.  Naoto's heart broke because he's never heard Takahiro care so much  that he cried before. " I miss cuddling up to you but you have to heal." Shokichi said as he tried not to cry.  " Oh baby I never was hurt by you. My inner conscious is telling me that I should leave because I'm not worth your time." Takahiro said and Shokichi started to cry. " I want to visit you, can I ? " Takahiro asked and Shokichi said yes.  Taiki got out of his arms . The three of them left.  Takahiro quickly rushed in and laid in Shokichi's arms .</p>

Shokichi slowly fell back asleep. <br/>He woke up a few hours later to  Takahiro  curled up in his arms.  He forgot that Takahiro could teleport. He kissed the man in his arms.  " Hmm I'm comfy" Takahiro said as Shokichi smiled .Takahiro gave Shokichi's chest a couple  kisses as he  felt a face hide in the crook of his neck. <br/>He whispered how much of a good puppy Shokichi is as he began to feel Shokichi transform into a wolf.  He knew that Shokichi transformed into a wolf when there was a need for protection. " Puppy we're fine . I got you , no protection needed ." He whispered as Shokichi waged his tail. He held a paw tightly as Shokichi changed back . " Baby I'm okay " He said  as he was kissed softly.  They went back to sleep  even though Shokichi sensed danger and gripped Takahiro tightly. Takahiro was snoring , clinging to him tightly. He nuzzled Shokichi's cheek with his nose. Shokichi looked down at him giving him quick kiss. Takahiro was still asleep. Shokichi was pouting because he couldn't go back to sleep.  Takahiro woke up slowly as he looked up at Shokichi giving him a squeeze. Shokichi gave Takahiro a kiss , sitting up. He felt a body sit on his lap, curling up  into his chest.</p>

  <p>Shokichi and Takahiro went to work. Shokichi had Takahiro in his lap while writing a song ,  Takahiro wasn't distracting him since Takahiro fell asleep snuggled against his chest.  He kissed Takahiro's head. Takahiro was helping him write but he fell asleep. He felt his head being  kissed and he squeezed Shokichi's waist, looking up at the man holding him semi awake . Shokichi looked at him smiling.  Takahiro kissed him softly as his back was rubbed. " You worked so hard baby." He said as  Shokichi held him close.  He kissed his chest softly as held one of his hands.  He teleported out of Shokichi's arms and Shokichi pouted.  Shokichi looked at him pouting and Takahiro went back into his arms.  He felt kisses down his chest. " Love you " Takahiro said as he heard the recording of Shokichi's voice .  " My baby has a beautiful voice" Takahiro continued and saw Shokichi's face become red . He kissed the blushing cheeks.  <br/>Takahiro knew how much he loved Shokichi .  Does Shokichi know how much he loved him?  He felt so bad for hurting him that he wanted to fix him and be his . He loved him for a long time.  Nesmith was hurting him , he remembered what happened while him and Nesmith was alone that made him cry. He was told to hurt Shokichi to make him look good.  Shokichi heard him whisper " No I can't , No I won't ." and held him close.  " I know Nesmith told you to hurt me and not to stop" He said as  Takahiro wiped the tear going down his cheek away . " Shh baby don't cry, He's gone now ." Shokichi said as he rubbed Takahiro's chest. Elly heard through the door frame, he felt even more guilty for what he did and he just sat against the wall , silently crying. Shokichi noticed this once he put down a sleeping Takahiro and walked out in the hallway.  He sat down and Elly went to his lap , hugging him tightly . "It's not your fault , you didn't know. I forgive you ." Shokichi kept whispering into Elly's ear.  Takahiro walked into the hallway after  waking up , noticing Elly crying. He let Shokichi keep comforting him as he kissed the top of Shokichi's head. He watched him give Elly to Omi. He felt arms lift him up. " Your safe baby , sleep I got you ." He heard  Shokichi whisper in his ear, kissing his cheek.  Shokichi sat back down once he got back in the studio. " Home "Takahiro whispered as he teleported them to the house.  Shokichi blinked , looking a little worried. He noticed Takahiro hugging him tightly, calming him down .  They both fell asleep once they changed.</p>

" Baby continue" Shokichi said in a raspy voice as he woke up.  "I want to be in your arms ." Takahiro whispered as Shokichi pulls him up and into his arms.

  <p>" Shokichi please wake up . " Takahiro begged  as he started crying.  Shokichi coughed up more blood . Takahiro called Elly and told him what he did which was a bad idea. Takahiro was crying frantically as Shokichi woke up .  Shokichi was crying because it hurt too much , he tried to move away from Takahiro. Akira teleported himself in and and saw blood . " Bubba" Shokichi whispered  as he was laid in the bed as he saw Takahiro being  beat up. Shokichi tried to explain that it was his fault and  yelled what he said to Takahiro.  Akira looked at him with disgust , healing Takahiro. Takahiro knew Shokichi was mourning still and looked at him .<br/>Shokichi cried in pain . " Baby I'm sorry ." He cried out as Takahiro healed him , he was shaking . Takahiro watched him  and knew better not to touch him. " Takahiro " He  heard as a cry.  He crawled to the other side of the bed .  " Don't leave " He heard as a cry. He knows Shokichi wants to cuddle but he felt worse .  " I didn't mean wh-what I said . I just was upset " Shokichi said as he  looked over at Takahiro.  <br/>Takahiro crawled into Shokichi's arms, he wiped the tears away.   " Baby calm, I'm not going to hurt you again, that really upset me . " He said as he snuggled up to him, clutching to Shokichi's shirt. <br/>Shokichi noticed tears going down Takahiro's face , giving him a squeeze.  He slowly gave him a kiss as wiped the tears away.  There was still  blood on his shirt. Akira was watching the interaction because he knew Shokichi was upset when he said what he said , he knew Takahiro was scared to loose Shokichi but Shokichi was almost killed by him.  Both of them screwed up in his mind . Shokichi was still having trouble breathing so he took them to the hospital.<br/>He was gasping for air but after a bit , stopped breathing.  He was rushed into an empty room.  . Naoto rushed into to see him and so did Atsushi. Atsushi slapped Takahiro alongside the head.   " Atsushi don't" Shokichi said  with a rasp . " I caused this mess." Shokichi said with a few tears coming down his cheeks.  Takahiro wiped Shokichi's tears away.  " Shh Sho your going to be fine." He said softly as he kissed his head and all of them left the room . Shokichi fell asleep. <br/>The next day he woke up, feeling somewhat better . Takahiro was looking at him as he sat up slowly. " Shokichi I'm sorry . I feel guilty. I knew you were upset." Takahiro said as his hand was squeezed. He gave Shokichi  sweet soft kisses . He walked out with Shokichi who was discharged, he hid his face in Shokichi's side giving him a squeeze. " Aww are you okay? Baby we're safe . I'm okay. " Shokichi said as Takahiro shook his head. Takahiro teleported them home. He still had his face hid in Shokichi's side , Shokichi just held him close.  He was relaxed but still worried about Shokichi.  They were in bed .</p>

  <p>" Kenchi" Shokichi said as he slowly woke up with his arms around around Kenchi. Takahiro was standing there worried they were in the studio but Kenchi noticed Shokichi was going to faint . Takahiro was scared , he wondered why Shokichi fainted like he did . He kissed the top of Shokichi's head as Kenchi let Shokichi go. Shokichi decided he wanted to stay in Kenchi's arms . Kenchi brought Shokichi to a conference room to ask him what's wrong. Shokichi started to say what was going on and that he felt sorry for bringing him into his problems and that nobody listened to him even after that incident.  Kenchi just wanted to hug him so tight .  He knew that Shokichi screwed up but he wanted to help anyway. He felt bad for him as he knew Takahiro was just using his kindness.  " K-Kenchi can I have a hug ?" Shokichi asked while shaking .  Kenchi noticed how shaky Shokichi was and hugged him tightly, keeping him close.  He heard sobs , he knew Shokichi was still in pain . He gives him a kiss on cheek. " I got you, your safe." Kenchi continuously whispered.  Kenchi wanted to fix this but he knew Shokichi had to fix it too.  Shokichi finally calmed down, the arms around him stayed around him protectively .  "I want to end it with Takahiro , it's hard to end it. I'm scared . I know I shouldn't of said what I said." Shokichi said while trying to steady his breathing.  " Is  he hurting you but you don't want to get him harmed ? " Kenchi asked and Shokichi  nodded.  He noticed the make  up on his face . <br/>Sway  and Kazuki walked in the room , seeing their senior covered in bruises . They both touched Shokichi's hand and said " Don't let Takahiro fool you , he will kill you like he did Nesmith." and Kenchi's jaw dropped .  " You gotta run " Kenchi said as he called the police and had Takahiro taken away. Shokichi  was in Kenchi's arms   still , he just wanted to stay in them because he was scared . Kenchi looks at Shokichi who's now in wolf form  on his lap asleep. He doesn't want to leave Shokichi alone . He wraps his jacket around him as he lifted him . "Ken-san. Your so strong ." Shokichi said as he wrapped his legs around Kenchi's waist .  He took him to the car as he felt a kiss to his cheek and heard a shaky whispered "<br/>Thank you".  He put him down on the seat .  He noticed that Shokichi lost more puppies and that's why he was more clingy then normal . He was upset. He knew Shokichi tried telling Takahiro but Takahiro didn't listen.  " Baby, Shokichi we can cuddle when we get home ." He said as he heard snores and continued to drive . Once they got home , he put Shokichi in bed , wrapping himself around him tightly.  " Ken..chi , are you going to stay?" Shokichi asked as he woke up. " Yes  I am , go to sleep you need it." Kenchi said as he watched Shokichi close his eyes.</p>

  <p>Kenchi woke up the person  on top of him by giving him a quick kiss, he was shy. Shokichi saw Kenchi's flustered face.  He quickly kissed him back becoming shy , tugging at his shirt. He hugged him tightly. Kenchi smiled  as he felt his neck get kissed. " Your so handsome, the puppies were going to look like you . I feel something coming from your stomach " He says as Shokichi looks surprised.  "<br/>Huh I thought they were dead because of the blood , but some of them lived .  I was going to leave Takahiro because he didn't like that I was expecting."  Shokichi said as Kenchi kissed his tears away. He rubbed Shokichi's stomach as the puppies kept kicking. "You guys or girls are going to be as pretty as daddy." Kenchi whispered to Shokichi's stomach .  Shokichi smiled as he kissed Kenchi's head as he tried to get up. Kenchi texted the two people he trusted most  they Shokichi was pregnant. It was a rare for a male wolf to get pregnant. Kenchi looks at Shokichi then looks away.<br/>Shokichi kisses down Kenchi's chest as he grinds against him. Kenchi stops him , giving him a kiss. " Shokichi calm down." He said as Shokichi begin to relax. Shokichi's touch to Kenchi's face was gentle. How did Takahiro not like this treatment? That's the question that went through Kenchi's head. Shokichi's touch to him was gentle, He really liked it.   <br/>Kenchi understands that Shokichi panics a lot  so whenever he does pulls him close to him whispering into his ear that he's okay and not to be scared . He notices that Shokichi kisses his arm if he feels protected.  Kenchi never feels tired when he helps Shokichi .  They went to work , and separated  for the day. Shokichi waited for him in the lobby. " Kenchi ." Kenchi heard Shokichi excitedly say as he hugged him tightly.  Kenchi was a vampire and a warlock  but Shokichi didn't care ,he truly loved Kenchi for how kind he is. He kissed Shokichi's lips as he buried his face into Shokichi's chest. Shokichi took him home. <br/>He felt kisses go down his chest after they got home , whimpering softly as Kenchi strips his clothes off. " No teasing." He whispered softly as he bit Kenchi's neck softly.  He whined in pain and Kenchi stopped. Kenchi cradled Shokichi's head against his chest. " Are you sure you want this ?" He asked and Shokichi nodded .  He put his dick inside Shokichi  and started to move slowly .  He heard moans as he kissed down his back , turning him around. As the thrusts got harasher , Shokichi's moans got louder as he released on the sheets.  Kenchi released inside him as he heard a whimper, Shokichi was trying to catch his breath as a loud moan came out and Kenchi pulled out.<br/>Shokichi was  washed off gently as he cuddled close to Kenchi . He buried his blushing face into Kenchi's side as they both began to fall asleep. He held the hand that was rubbing his stomach tightly. He was asleep.</p>

  <p>Shokichi woke up curled up to his Kenchi's side . It took him a couple days to decide to make Kenchi be his boyfriend. He remembered that day he was told to run  but wanted to be in Kenchi's arms instead. He sat on the counter as Kenchi cooked , huffing a bit . Kenchi stopped and gave him a kiss. They went into work , Akira noticed how they couldn't  be separated.  Shokichi was watching Kenchi dance , he ran over to catch him as he fell. He felt Kenchi's face bury in his chest.  " Baby are you alright?" Shokichi asked as Kenchi nodded. He felt a quick kiss.  <br/>Kenchi and Tetsuya knew Nesmith's motives to get him to stay. Tetsuya also knows Takahiro's motives which he told Kenchi why he tried to get Shokichi to stay  with him , it wasn't to hurt him .  Shokichi knew Akira felt like shit too but was scared to tell anyone. He noticed cuts on Akira's arms and pulled him into another room and asked him what's wrong. He noticed Akira start crying, Kenchi and Tetsuya were also in the room as Akira explained what happened . Shokichi looked at Kenchi because he couldn't find words to say. <br/>" I'm surprised the stylists knew about this and didn't tell anyone, even Hiro knew ." Tetsuya said  as he wiped Akira's tears away.  Kenchi wrapped  his arms around Shokichi's  waist. " Ken"  Shokichi whispered as he smiled.   He looked at Tetsuya and Akira cuddled up to each other .  " Baby let's leave them alone" Shokichi said as he let Kenchi pull him out of the room.  Shokichi stayed in Kenchi's arms for a bit longer as they shared a kiss. He wiggled out of his arms  trying to find food. Kenchi sighs as he helps Shokichi find food. Shokichi eats the chocolate he was given . He snuggled against Kenchi . At least  he was safe , closing his eyes. He  fell asleep as Kenchi rubbed his stomach. He felt a blanket on him , he woke up in bed.    He noticed that Kenchi took them home .  "Baby " Kenchi said as he sat on his lap , hugging him tightly.  "So cute" Shokichi said as he kissed Kenchi's lips. " Exile is ending, Akira said that he wanted it to end because too many members are going to leave." Shokichi said .  He kissed Kenchi's tears away. He just sat there and let Kenchi  cry into his shirt . He kissed down Kenchi's cheek. <br/>Kenchi  kissed Shokichi's neck softly as he grinded against him , Shokichi took off his pants slowly and inserted himself inside him . The thrusts were slow and gentle. Kenchi begged for harder and deeper thrusts as he moved his hips faster. Shokichi moaned as his thrusts got faster deeper , harsher and faster . Kenchi squirted then fully released as Shokichi released inside him. Shokichi cleaned off Kenchi as hickies were being left on his neck.  "I'm not leaving you ever" Shokichi said as Kenchi made him hard again.  " I like seeing you this way. You're so beautiful " Shokichi said as Kenchi was pushed onto the bed and he thrusted slow and hard into him . Kenchi released on the sheets and as Shokichi released in him. Kenchi pulled into Shokichi's arms and given soft kisses. They both fell asleep.</p>

  <p>Shokichi noticed that Kenchi was curled up to his chest when he woke up. The older man was cute to him , he traced Kenchi's face with his finger .  He felt a kiss to his lips. " You were awake the whole time." Shokichi said . "I'm good at acting  or am I ?" Kenchi asked as he was kissed .  He smiled at Kenchi then hid his face. Kenchi  thought this reaction was cute  and hugged him tightly , pouting. " My baby " He said in a pouting voice . Shokichi unhid his face and kissed Kenchi. " Baby don't be upset , I'm here." Shokichi whispered into Kenchi's ear softly as he rocked him. <br/>They both went into work . Kenchi didn't want to separate and Shokichi knew this but told him that he'll meet him later. He meets Shokichi in the studio and sat in his lap while he was editing songs. Nothing is better then this is what he thought.  He was kissed softly as he snuggled close to Shokichi's chest, holding him  tightly.  Akira and Tetsuya noticed this sight and smiled . They've never saw Kenchi fall for someone this bad and are surprised that Shokichi doesn't complain about him being too clingy.  <br/>" Baby boy " Kenchi whispered into Shokichi's ear as he looked at Shokichi cutely . Shokichi smiled softly as he heard a yawn. He let Kenchi sleep on his lap as he edited songs .  " I remember the time I was crying in Tetsuya's dressing room , Tetsuya was comforting me ..but the  thway Takahiro saw it.."  Shokichi said as he heard Kenchi said he remembers that .  " Oi , stop scaring me like that ." Shokichi said as he kissed Kenchi's pout. " He was doing nothing wrong but why were you naked?" Kenchi asked  and Shokichi blushed.<br/>Tetsuya walked in the room . " I was .. I was trying out something " Shokichi said as Tetsuya walked into the room. He felt a hand hold his, Akira pulled him out . Shokichi felt Kenchi leave his arms , he looked at him , shaking. "He .. hurt me .. " Shokichi said  as he cried . Akira punched Tetsuya in the hallway while they were listening in.  Shokichi knew Akira was there but who did he hit.  He saw Tetsuya laying down in the hallway unconscious.  He cuddled up to Kenchi on the couch . He was crying  , Kenchi was holding him tightly. " I'm not leaving " Kenchi said.  He felt Akira's hand on his shoulder, and heard him whisper " Your safe , don't worry." .  He kissed down Kenchi's cheek .  " Was he going to hurt Shokichi ?" He heard Kenchi ask Akira .  "Uh uh"  Akira answered.  " Kenchi can I ?" Akira asked as he noticed Shokichi cuddling close to Kenchi , growling .  " I think Shokichi wants to be alone with me , no." Kenchi said as Akira left. " Sho -Chan I got you shh" Kenchi whispered. Shokichi was on Kenchi's lap , hugging him tightly.  He noticed lips against his and  smirked. He moaned softly as the kisses got rougher, pulling away as he began to loose breath. Kenchi was tracing the tattoos on Shokichi's arm wondering why Shokichi kept them.</p>

  <p>Kenchi and Shokichi knew each other for a long time but never were as close as they are now. Kenchi kisses down  Shokichi's neck  , smiling as Shokichi was relaxed in his lap.  He noticed Shokichi fell asleep. " Puppy " he whispered as he noticed Shokichi turned into his wolf form . Kenchi laughs quietly at how comfortable Shokichi was to not control his ability to change into a wolf when he is sleeping. He rested his head on the fur and teleported them home. " Kenchi" He heard Shokichi whisper as he held him close.  He knew Shokichi lost the puppies because he's never left alone . He rested head against his stomach, feeling no kicking. His hair was played with.   <br/>Shokichi knew Kenchi sensed something was wrong, he kissed his head. He noticed Kenchi 's eyes had a sad look to them and hugged him tighter . He kissed his cheek softly and he knew people were manipulating him to stay away from Kenchi. Kenchi was hurt in multiple situations too and Shokichi noticed this. Shokichi will never stay away from Kenchi , he keeps getting weird texts telling him to stay away from Kenchi. He showed Kenchi the texts that tell him to stay away from him and he walked out of the room. Kenchi started crying and Shokichi's never heard Kenchi cry before.  Shokichi looked at Kenchi, calling Sway to ask him about if he's getting weird texts and sway answered that he was . Shokichi began to cry and Kenchi came over to him ,hugging him tightly. " Baby" He whispered softly, Kenchi just held on tighter.  " I'm going no where." Kenchi said as he  traced the tattoo of the man he was holding.  <br/>" I'm glad baby , I'm just as upset as you are . I just want to be with you . " Shokichi said as his neck was kissed.  His baby . His Kenchi was  seducing  him , he just couldn't resist to let out a moan. He was embarrassed and blushed . Kenchi noticed and pouting saying sorry in a cute way.  He felt arms around his waist and a kiss to his lips.  He clung to the body that lifted him up.  Shokichi noticed Kenchi bury his face in  his chest once he sat down . They both sat in silence, calming down .  These texts were scaring them. <br/>Shokichi felt Kenchi's lips travel down his chest, he noticed little bite marks. He moaned as he felt Kenchi  suck his dick noticing him grind against the sheets. " Baby in me , please" Kenchi heard in a moan, he flipped Shokichi over sliding his dick inside him. He began to thrust slowly , Shokichi whined and moaned . The thrusts became harsher and faster, Shokichi moaned as he felt kisses down his back. Kenchi  releases inside him as he noticed Shokichi release on the sheets . He pulled out , starting to clean Shokichi off . He let Shokichi curl up to his chest. The worry they had was temporarily gone , both of them fell asleep after sharing gentle kisses.</p>

  <p>Kenchi woke up first,  looking at Shokichi curled up to him . He moved away slowly. Shokichi woke up and looked up at him . He kissed Kenchi's cheek as he was helped up. He was asked if he felt okay and just hid his face  in Kenchi's chest , that tells Kenchi that he was still scared  about those text messages.  He calmed down after awhile. They both went into work.<br/>Shokichi let Kenchi onto his lap as he worked on songs , he noticed Kenchi was asleep and kissed his cheek as he let him . He continued working. Atsushi was smiling as he looked through the window.  Shokichi just continued working as Kenchi  woke up and kissed him softly.  " Sho Chan is so comfy, I could stay in his lap all day" Kenchi said in a cute voice which caused Shokichi's grip to be tighter.  Kenchi watched him edit songs and suggested some edits which Shokichi gladly did .  Shokichi took a break and put Kenchi on the couch them he got something to eat. He came back to Kenchi all beaten and got angry , Atsushi rushed in the room  and  explained how he tried to help  Kenchi and broke down . He hasn't seen Atsushi cry this hard  before.  He tried to calm Atsushi down so that the explanation can be easily explained.  He cleaned Kenchi up as he listened to the explanation Atsushi gave. He was upset at himself.<br/>Kenchi snuggled close to Shokichi , wiping his tears away .  He felt a kiss to his lips and heard a whispered sorry . He noticed how sad Shokichi was  and tried to calm him down. " Baby I'll be okay." Kenchi said as he held Shokichi on his lap , giving him a few more kisses. He watched a face bury into his chest. “ I haven’t seen him calm down like that before “ Atsushi said . “ Takahiro always had him worried thinking he did something wrong.” Atsushi said . “ You were threatened to take him to see Takahiro that day , weren’t you? Because I know know Naoto would never have let you do that .” Kenchi said and Atsushi nodded. <br/>“ it’s not your fault , Atsushi .” Hiro said as he walked in . Shokichi’s eyes widened as he looked over at how Atsushi was holding on to Hiro.  “ You guys are , uh.. dating ?” Shokichi tried ask as Kenchi tried to get Hiro to avoid the questions. “ We’ve known each other for a long time so.. it was bound to happen.” Hiro said as he smiled at Atsushi. “ My wife is okay with it , I told her and we divorced.  I still get to see the kids and so does Atsushi. She doesn’t mind.” Hiro continued. Both of them left the room  as Kenchi and Shokichi were still shocked.  <br/>Kisses went down Shokichi’s cheeks and Kenchi saw a smile . Kenchi teleported them back home , he let Shokichi clean off his wounds and cuddled close to him . Kenchi did heal himself a tiny bit but just wanted Shokichi to play nurse which made Shokichi roll his eyes.</p>

  <p>" Ken" Shokichi whispered as he looked at Kenchi . Kenchi noticed Shokichi was worried. " I'm just glad it wasn't you who got hurt . I've watched you get hurt but was scared to intervene. " Kenchi says as he tried not to cry . Shokichi just held on to him as he kissed his cheek. He just looked at the man who fell asleep on his lap  , hugging him tightly.  He  thought Kenchi was cute while sleeping so he took a picture, he noticed Kenchi was smiling . He pouted as he began to fall asleep.<br/> " Sleep  baby I got you " Kenchi said half asleep as he laid Shokichi down  then snuggled up to him .  They fell asleep . Kenchi was curled up to Shokichi when he woke up.  Shokichi thought Kenchi was cute unlike Takahiro who made him scared everytime.  He felt free with Kenchi even though he was still scared. Kenchi felt a tear fall  down his cheek and held onto Shokichi tightly . " Sh baby I'm here don't cry " He heard Shokichi whisper as he woke up slowly , noticing he was in Shokichi's lap. Shokichi's heart beat made Kenchi calm down.<br/>" Are you sure you want to visit Takahiro? Even after what he did to you?" Kenchi asked as he went to visit Takahiro with Shokichi. They both saw a beaten Takahiro, they noticed how shaky Takahiro was when he talked and there was blood near his ankle . Takahiro explained that the guard did it. He was scared to endure it again . Shokichi teared up , Takahiro didn't deserve this in his mind that's probably why he was clingy towards Shokichi the first time he was out. Kenchi noticed he was coughing up blood , he found a way to get him out to get him medical care.  The doctors noticed how scared Takahiro was.  Shokichi was in the corner trying not to cry because he hated how this happened and Takahiro motioned him to come over so he did . Takahiro was trying to say how sorry he was for the way he treating  him and everything that happened. He passed out. Kenchi noticed the connection they had and noticed how worried Shokichi got and held him close. He knew Takahiro would live. He wants to hear both sides of the relationship before he makes a conclusion. <br/>Takahiro explains his end of the relationship and admits his faults and knows Shokichi admitted his already . He listens to Shokichi's side and noticed he was neglecting his emotions. He knew that he was trying to fix that before getting others involved  but Shokichi truly didn't know that others would of hurt him that's what Takahiro knows. " Bubba" Shokichi heard Takahiro whisper . <br/>Shokichi noticed how shy Takahiro when he explained how much he loved him and still loves him . He knows he screwed up  ,starting to cry , Takahiro notices this  and pouted because he wanted to cuddle up to him and make him feel better so he teleported to Shokichi's lap.  Shokichi noticed this because Takahiro would do this all the time if he was upset.</p>

  <p>" Bubba " Takahiro said as he was shy and tried not to . " I wanted our relationship to be over because too many people were getting involved with it and I felt like I was getting guilt tripped to leave you . That's why I told Kenchi about how I felt instead of you." Shokichi said as Kenchi smiled . " So you weren't going to kill  him" Kenchi asked and Takahiro shook his head .  " I would never do that , I accidentally hurt him because he made me upset and I couldn't control my emotions . I'm sorry . I haven't felt anger before." Takahiro said as his tears were kissed away.  " Baby don't cry ." Shokichi whispered in his ear. " I don't want to go back please don't let them hurt me." Takahiro pleaded . Kenchi bailed him out .  " Actually I begged to see Takahiro." Shokichi said , feeling guilty . Kenchi let them know that he'll always be there for them as he left . He knew Shokichi was happy and that he treated him well so he smiled. Meanwhile Takahiro and Shokichi were talking about how they felt because Takahiro knew Shokichi kissed Kenchi and Shokichi looked at Kenchi  with tears in his eyes but he knew he didn't want to hurt Takahiro nor Kenchi .  He had to make a choice for both of their safety so he choose Kenchi because he knew he everyone would be trying to harm his relationship if he ever has one again with Takahiro.   He cries softly as he walks up to Kenchi  but Kenchi noticed how heartbroken Shokichi and told them both he'll  tell Atsushi and Hiro about what happened.<br/>Eyes glared at Shokichi the next day in the office, he started to panic, going into a corner  and crying . " You guys really hurt him " Atsushi and Hiro said in unison . " Takahiro didn't really have any motives to hurt him , even though there's bruises on Shokichi  he endures them because they're mainly caused by flashbacks that only Shokichi can calm down. " Atsushi continued as Hiro tried to get Shokichi out of the corner .  Shokichi  finally comes out but he's still crying.  Takahiro coaxed Shokichi to get into the conference room and talk to him and Kenchi . Shokichi had Takahiro on his lap as he talked .  Takahiro noticed how Ryuji stared at Shokichi .  He asked if that's why Shokichi acted the way he did . Kenchi saw the nod and saw the tears well  up in his eyes . He asked Takahiro if Shokichi could be on his lap.  Takahiro complied and saw how  calm Shokichi got . Takahiro knows it's time to end it because they'll end up hurting each other. Takahiro explains to Shokichi that he should be Kenchi due to the past and that's what Shokichi remembers if he keeps going back  to him . Shokichi knows Takahiro is right because the same things will happen again and clutches Kenchi's shirt tightly.  " Takahiro's right . You seem happier with me , right?  " Kenchi asked as Shokichi nodded .  Shokichi snuggled into Kenchi's chest. Takahiro was about to cry even though he did the right thing  . He realized there's no them anymore and started crying. Shokichi heard the cries and went over to Takahiro and hugged him.</p>

  <p>Once Shokichi let Takahiro go , he watched Takahiro collapse to the floor. He picked him up and held him close. " Heartbroken and hurt too many times." Kenchi said .  " I don't know what to do. " Shokichi said. " Well we could help .. " Hiro said as him and Atsushi looked in from the door way.  Takahiro held on to Shokichi tighter. <br/>Kenchi felt bad for Takahiro but he knew Shokichi didn't know what he truly wanted . He felt like Shokichi agreed to not see Takahiro get hurt again. Kenchi watching the struggles that Shokichi and Takahiro went through to stay together actually hurt him . Kenchi remembers Takahiro being so  happy but what happened Shokichi and that caused Takahiro to break. He knows that probably is why Shokichi felt safe in his arms  because Shokichi was finally away from people using his kindness to tear his relationships apart. <br/>Shokichi's heart beat wasn't  steady , he started to panic and Takahiro woke up .   He heard Takahiro whisper that he's okay and that he himself was safe . Kenchi noticed the interaction and thought to himself that it was good. <br/>Takahiro was overly protective of Shokichi and everyone in the room knew that.  " Are you sure you want to leave me?"  Takahiro whispered in his ear.  He saw  Shokichi shake his head.   " Kenchi, I changed my mind . I'm sorry . I'm glad I had you while I did. " Shokichi said . " You'll have me always . If anything goes wrong call me." Kenchi says  . Shokichi nods  as he feels Takahiro snuggle against him.  Hiro and Atsushi walked out of the room then Shokichi and Takahiro.  Shokichi felt a face bury in his side, he kissed the top of Takahiro's head.  " Baby you're okay . I'm okay"  Shokichi said as he felt lips against his.  He noticed how legs wrapped around his waist  as Takahiro jumped up . His neck was kissed softly  then he looked down at Takahiro  who was acting innocent. The others noticed how scared Takahiro was and the kiss to Shokichi's neck indicated that fear.  <br/>Mandy touched Takahiro's hand realizing there's trust still towards him  but he knows the rest of them will have to gain the trust back . He was gentle. Mandy knew him and  Kenchi  knew the truth .  Shokichi remembers the argument he had with Takahiro which caused him to get hurt.  He was teleported to home, Takahiro got down  laying Shokichi down and snuggled close to him . Takahiro felt arms pull him closer to the man that was he snuggled up to. He looked up at Shokichi , rubbing his stomach. " I should of listened to you more." Takahiro said as he felt a kiss to his lips. Shokichi just smiled and kisses Takahiro back. He whimpered as he looked away. " Baby what happened?" Takahiro asked . Kenchi sensed fear and teleported to where Shokichi was.  " He's scared . Not of you" Kenchi said .   " Are you sure about us?" Takahiro asked and Shokichi shook his head .  " I understand that you think something will happen." Takahiro said as he heard Shokichi say the words no don't.</p>

  <p>Shokichi screamed help as Kenchi tried to get him out of Takahiro's grasp .   Takahiro was tied up and Shokichi was crying while Kenchi was holding him. " Baby shh , I'm here." Kenchi whispered into Shokichi's ear.  Akira teleported to see if Shokichi was alright .  " Kenchi , please  take Shokichi with you because I trust you." Akira said and Kenchi nodded.  Kenchi teleported himself and Shokichi to his house, he felt a kiss to his lips. " Bubba" Shokichi whispered into Kenchi's ear giving him a hug .  He was checking and healing Shokichi as he felt Shokichi's grip get tighter, giving his cheek a kiss. The only thing he can't heal is the mental pain and fear that Shokichi feels . He knew the others were right  Takahiro can never change. He kissed Shokichi's neck . Shokichi sensed fear and laid down , playing with Kenchi's hair. " Puppy " He heard Kenchi whisper as turned into a wolf because the fear sensed was above anything he's sensed before, he felt a face bury in fur and felt tears. Kenchi felt guilt not fear . Shokichi tried to cheer him up , he saved him from Takahiro .<br/>Kenchi looked at wolf who was sleeping looking at the paw wrapped around him as he watched the transformation back into a human , he softly kissed Shokichi's lips.  Shokichi heard the whispered I love you and smiled . Kenchi snuggled up to Shokichi and fell asleep slowly holding Shokichi's arm .  He was crying in his sleep, Shokichi woke up and rocked him slowly. " Never again " He whispered as Shokichi woke him up . "Baby don't be scared ." He heard Shokichi say as he nuzzled his face into Shokichi's chest.  " Kenchi..I love you so much . Don't worry I'm here through everything." Shokichi said as tears went down his face.  Kenchi kissed tears away. "I love you a lot , seeing you get hurt , hurt me a lot too because I was scared to do anything." Kenchi said as Shokichi  kissed him softly as he felt the urge to cling to him . " I'm glad you saved me, can we stay like this?" Shokichi said .  Shokichi knows Kenchi likes being in his lap, snuggled close so he lets him.  It's cute to him and he felt kisses his neck. He whimpered ,Kenchi thought it was adorable to tease Shokichi by leaving bite marks down his chest.  Kenchi noticed Shokichi wanted more so he slipped off his  boxers , taking Shokichi  and flipping him over, slamming inside of him , beginning to move slowly. Shokichi's moans filled the room. He released inside Shokichi , he moved to Shokichi's lap and adjusted himself. Shokichi started to move as Kenchi moved . The movements became faster and harsher , Kenchi moaned loudly .  There was love bites all over their bodies . Shokichi released inside Kenchi as he heard a loud moan , Kenchi released again and he caught it in his mouth and swallowed .  He heard a whine , he pulled out  then he cleaned Kenchi up then himself . He let Kenchi snuggle up to his side.</p>

He fell asleep snuggled up to Shokichi's side , giving him a kiss.  A few hours later Shokichi  woke up but didn't want to move because Kenchi was snuggled up to him.  The elder looked cute to Shokichi  and kissed his lips gently. He never thought Kenchi liked guys . He sat up and Kenchi moved to his lap , going back to sleep. " Baby stay." He heard Kenchi whisper.  " How long did you like me for?" Shokichi asked . " Since you were with Nesmith ." Kenchi answered .  <br/>Flashback <br/>Shokichi was in Kenchi's arms  scared .  Nesmith was hurting him , Kenchi knew that much. Kenchi  felt a kiss to his lips , his  grip around Shokichi tightened since the fear was sensed . Shokichi fell asleep in his arms.  Kenchi promised to keep him safe.</p><p>Kenchi  knew he kept his promise but fell in love .  Shokichi smiled as the elder kissed him again.  Kenchi loved being in Shokichi's arms and he let Shokichi know that.  Atsushi was right about something once Kenchi falls in love he's super protective. Kenchi was holding onto Shokichi protectively  while on his lap.  Shokichi smiled at the man on his lap.  He thought Kenchi was being cute but he noticed he was upset . " Baby don't be upset." Shokichi said as he rubbed Kenchi's back. He watched Kenchi calm.   " It's my turn  to return the favor and protect you ." Shokichi said as Kenchi kissed him softly.  Kenchi wrapped his legs around Shokichi's waist . He was carried downstairs. Shokichi felt  kisses as he fell down the stairs. Kenchi  got worried as he started to check Shokichi for any bruises.  He felt a hand rub his back trying to calm him down .  " I'm okay baby I got you ." Shokichi said as he smiled .  He was given kisses and held close. Shokichi pouted , looking down.  Kenchi noticed Shokichi had a carpet burn, he put medicine on it.  He felt arms wrap tightly around him as he began to cook. Shokichi was given a plate and gave Kenchi a gentle kiss . He felt a body sit on his lap after he was done. He knew Kenchi was still frightened. Kenchi was was curled up into Shokichi's chest, his back back was being rubbed . He was kissed softly. He loved Shokichi so much but he feels like Shokichi's still in love with Takahiro.  He and Shokichi knew Takahiro did things that he couldn't help .  They heard a scream . It was Takahiro and they went to look. Takahiro was getting hurt , Shokichi had the urge to help but looked at Kenchi. " Akira is doing all the harm , I know it . Takahiro didn't know how to say it was him ." Shokichi said as watched Takahiro walk up to the door, coughing blood .  " Takahiro, I know Akira is making you do all this but why?" Shokichi asked as Kenchi healed him.</p>

  <p>" So you killed Nesmith because Akira  helped him cheat by using you ." Shokichi said as he started to cry , Takahiro  wiped his tears away. " You were trying to save him because Akira was using you to get to him but you fell in love with him ." Kenchi  said as he saw a nod and Takahiro breaking down. Shokichi noticed and pulled him close.  "Atsushi and  Hiro knew but were too late to stop it " Takahiro said . Shokichi just held Takahiro .  Kenchi knew Takahiro  was telling the truth .  Shokichi knew Takahiro was always over at Kenchi's place if he needed a place to stay. <br/>" Akira manipulated Tetsuya too , also everyone into believing I'm the bad guy." Takahiro said as his heart stopped beating  for a second. " Baby don't die." Shokichi  said as Takahiro's heart beat went back to normal.  " I'm fine . Just scared. Kenchi always believed me ." Takahiro said . Shokichi  just held Takahiro tightly.  He wrapped a blanket around Takahiro, feeling a hand hold his. " Takahiro does love you very much , he never meant to scare you or  hurt you ." Kenchi said.   He knew Kenchi was right , Takahiro would never hurt him  or never meant to.  He looked at the man curled up in his chest.  He knew Takahiro never met harm and always wanted him safe.  Everytime Takahiro hurt him , it was a flashback , he knew this and tried calm him down. Kenchi also knew that  but because he let himself get hurt because he knew Takahiro would get scared if he was forced out of these flashbacks.  He noticed Shokichi  give Takahiro a kiss.  Shokichi and Takahiro missed each other, Kenchi knew that.  Takahiro fell asleep on Shokichi's lap, Kenchi smiled.  " You should stay with Takahiro for the night , I'm fine here alone." Kenchi said as he teleported them to the guest room.  He woke up snuggled against Takahiro's chest.  Takahiro smiled at him as  he held his hand tightly.  "I love you  so much. " Shokichi said  as he kissed him. Takahiro explains how much he loves him , he noticed how Shokichi started to cry.  " Baby don't cry, shh." Takahiro said as he explained how he wanted to fix himself but everyone except Shokichi and Kenchi wanted him to .  He noticed how Shokichi kissed his tears away , he was the one that was supposed to protect Shokichi from the people he thought that he was able to trust.  Shokichi let Takahiro bury his face into his chest, he noticed how Takahiro cuddled up to him. Kenchi was smiling as he was listening in to the conversation, He  wished  the others would of let them talk out how they felt. He knew that wasn't possible as they wanted to make Takahiro look bad even though Takahiro was weak.   Shokichi noticed how Takahiro fell back asleep.  He was sad still , squeezing Takahiro.  He felt a kiss on his chest.  " Baby don't worry I'm here . I got you ." He heard as a whisper. He smiled as he pouted for a kiss , he felt a kiss to his lips.</p>

" I could I never get him to sleep,  he couldn't forget  the time you guys had. He kept crying. I kept him safe ." Kenchi  said . Shokichi was tossing and turning. He was having a nightmare.  <br/>Takahiro  crawled into Shokichi's arms , he was relived when he calmed him down .  " Takahiro don't leave ." Shokichi started repeating.  This broke Takahiro's heart and Shokichi's eyes opened.  He was giving Shokichi a dozen kisses per minute. " Hmm baby I'm okay ." Shokichi said. Takahiro searches Shokichi's body  for bruises.  His baby . His Shokichi . Is okay. " Baby you are so cute , I'm okay . " Shokichi  said as he pulled Takahiro on top of him. He smiled as he  kissed him softly.  <br/>Shokichi held Takahiro tightly  , feeling legs wrap around his waist, arms wrapping around his neck .

Kenchi didn't know that happened but Keiji did and didn't tell him because he was so fed up and wanted to leave. Exile is ending on a bad note  Kenchi continued .  <br/>Takahiro snuggled up to Shokichi's chest as he listened. He knew what he did was wrong but him  and Shokichi were getting hurt , he explained that to Kenchi . Kenchi understood as Shokichi tried to calm Takahiro down. He patted Takahiro's head. " You'll be okay." He whispered.  Shokichi smiled as Takahiro kissed him.  His arm was kissed and  he heard it's my turn to to protect you whispered into his ear .  He realized that Takahiro fell asleep in his arms. He continued talking to Kenchi as Takahiro shivered .  He put Takahiro back into the bed and let him sleep.

He noticed that Shokichi's face was buried in his chest now.  His baby.  His Shokichi is in his arms, he missed that so much.  He kissed Shokichi's head softly. " I love you so much." He said as Shokichi's fingers connected with his . He missed this so much , he let tears quietly go down his face. He felt kisses  go down his cheeks.  He smiled as he looked at Shokichi's eyes.</p>

He was pinned to the bed as Shokichi's movements became harsher and faster. He felt Shokichi's cum inside him . He was snuggled against Shokichi's chest as they  caught their breath. His kisses were gentle. Shokichi was wrapped around Takahiro like a blanket , he noticed Takahiro was asleep. He's the only one that truly loves Takahiro and he knows that. Takahiro was holding Shokichi's hand as they slept . He woke up a few hours later to a smiling face that was sleeping  . He crawled up Shokichi's chest to give him a kiss. He heard a giggle and saw eyes open. " Baby " He said as he clung to Shokichi tightly. He was taken to the shower, he was put in and washed . Shokichi was washed off . As the shower got cold , he felt Takahiro shiver and turned the water off. He made sure Takahiro was dry and dressed. He felt arms around his waist, giving Takahiro a kiss that was gentle, he noticed how Takahiro had shaky legs still. They went downstairs to eat , Shokichi gave Takahiro his plate . He watched Takahiro eat then ate his plate. He felt arms around him and smiled . He was on Takahiro's lap, hugging him tightly. Takahiro noticed that Shokichi  was curled up  on his lap and started to give him kisses. They both went in to work , Takahiro was looking up at Shokichi with a smile. They both separated for the day .  Takahiro was listening to some tracks and making some edits when Shokichi started his break.</p>

He felt punches , he froze , not wanting to deal with this and was teleported away.  Akira saw bruises as Shokichi  cried into his chest. " I feel like he's using me" Shokichi whispered as Akira kissed his cheek.  " I've been trying to get away from him , you saved me ." Shokichi whispered as he snuggled close.<br/>

" I'm going nowhere, I tried my best to leave him. I'm sorry " Shokichi said as he starred crying. Sway saw Kazuki curl up to Shokichi's chest as Mandy walked in asking what was wrong. Everything was  explained to Mandy.  They looked at how Shokichi's  face nuzzled against Mandy's hand .<br/>
Elly walked by and noticed bruises on Shokichi's face . Elly was looking through the window as he felt the urge to go in .  He went in and saw Shokichi's face up close , shaking.

Their joint studio was the place Shokichi was taken , he told Elly everything and how he felt .<br/>
Elly was gentle as he snuggled against Shokichi's chest. He told Shokichi , Takahiro came looking for him so he told him to help . He  noticed the dried blood  on Shokichi's  cheek from his nose , kissing his cheek gently. He kept  hearing Shokichi  say he doesn't want to go back and he listens to the reasons why.

They both had Elly and Taiki  make out with them  if they were comfortable with it.   Takahiro watched Shokichi snuggle up to Elly's chest and smiled as he watched Taiki snuggle up to his .  "They're so cute , let's take them with us."  Takahiro said as he teleported  all of them home.  Taiki was surprised when he woke up in a bed snuggled against Takahiro as Elly was calm and kissed Shokichi's lips again.  Their hands were together, all four hands  . Three sets of lips were  against Shokichi's lips , they heard a whimper . "Shokichi , Takahiro is this a good idea?" Takahiro heard Elly ask and a memory came to him . Shokichi quickly crawled over to Takahiro and and held him tightly. " No " Shokichi said as he felt a nose nuzzle his cheek . "Elly you don't have to go , maybe Taiki should because Takahiro's not ready ." Shokichi said . Takahiro looked at Elly and hugged him tightly, wrapping his legs around him as Shokichi kissed the top of his head.  Taiki left after Shokichi hugged him tightly. Both Elly and Taiki felt the tension between Takahiro and Shokichi. Shokichi overheard what Takahiro was saying and he somewhat agreed  and Elly went out to find him on the stairs crying , he  let Elly hug him tightly. " He could of told me  how he felt , I feel like dirt" Shokichi said as he heard stuff breaking in the room.

Elly noticed the bruises when the makeup washed off , Akira wiped the tears away . The whole room was trashed . Naoto popped in and ran to Shokichi. " I knew something like this was going to happen. " Naoto said as he cradled Shokichi's face in his hands.  " Baby  I'm here , shh." Naoto whispered into Shokichi's ear. Shokichi snuggled against Naoto , trying to calm down . He finally falls asleep and Akira knows why he didn't sleep. Akira felt the tension between Takahiro and Shokichi too . The album never got done and  Akira knew Takahiro was the distraction because there was fights between them all the time even though they only showed everybody the cute couple things . Akira told Naoto what was happening and that Kenchi even fell for it. " Kenchi hasn't been into work is that why?" Naoto asked as Akira explained that Kenchi was being used by Takahiro. Shokichi  woke up after and a couple minutes, Naoto just wanted to hold him a little longer . " Kenchi , you're okay. Shokichi is okay."  Akira said as Kenchi crouched down to kiss Shokichi's cheek , wiping a tear away .  Shokichi jumped into Kenchi's arms.  " Wow he did trash everything.
