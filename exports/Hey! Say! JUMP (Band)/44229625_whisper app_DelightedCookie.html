  <strong>This guy in the condo across mine has all his lights on and dancing alone in his underwear. Living his best life, honestly.</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: MisterStealYoMan26</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Thanks my boyfriend just left me and I am celebrating because he's shit. Do u wanna join in?</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: MakeThisMushroomPop22</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Right coz you're the guy in the other building. Do a cartwheel!</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: MisterStealYoMan26</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Make sure ure watching because I'm not doing this again.</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: MakeThisMushroomPop22</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Okay holy shit I'm coming to you with food and drinks to celebrate your independence. Meet me downstairs later.</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: MisterStealYoMan26</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Oh look they'll definitely fuck</strong>
</p><p>
  <span>User: OverTheMoon15</span>

</p><p>
  <span>Takaki chuckled when he saw the response to his post while he stood in the lobby of the neighboring building, two boxes of pizza and a pack of beer in a plastic bag. He sent a DM to 'MakeThisMushroomPop22' telling him he's already in the lobby and if he could kindly pick him up now...</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Holy shit - you were serious about the food and drinks!" a voice said, laughing, the familiar man now up close and looking at him in amusement. "I thought you were pulling my leg!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I said I was coming to you with food and drinks, didn't I?" Takaki asked, presenting the entire thing, expecting he'd finally take it. "Happy independence day,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wow - uh - let's go up? I can't finish this by myself and celebrating is always fun with people around," the other said. Yuya would've said no, give him the thing and go back home but the man was already walking to the elevator, turning to him with expecting eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I wasn't really thinking about coming up and joining you. I just felt sort of happy for you for living your best life at two in the morning," Takaki said as he sat on the floor, opening the boxes and the pack of beer. Looking at the window, he saw his own window right across, curtains drawn up to the side. If he turned his lights on, they could've done something like in that Taylor Swift song. Would've been amusing, definitely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Called my boyfriend and heard someone else tell him to come back to bed before he cut the line. Does that seem like a prank?" the other asked instead, placing two glasses in front of him. He suddenly noticed that he's still just wearing his underwear only with an oversized shirt that afforded him decency.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If it was, he would've told you who it was. Not panic and cut the line," Takaki shrugged, bowing when the man gave him a slice of the pizza he bought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly. So I sent him a message that we're done and if he wants his things back, he'll have to look for them in the garbage," the man shrugged and took a big bite, humming in approval.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you also tell him he's garbage?" Takaki asked and the man smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Told him he wouldn't have to look too far since he lives in the garbage already,"</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"I probably shouldn't stay long in case he comes here begging for forgiveness," Takaki said but made no move. He wasn't expecting the man to have a stash ready and now he's pleasantly buzzed that if he stood up, he'd definitely fall back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Probably. But it'd be so funny if he comes here and he sees you," Inoo said from the floor, staring up at the ceiling. As the night proceeded, the two began talking about their past relationships and breakups, laughing at some, snorting at others. It's kind of nice to be able to talk about those things knowing the other person does not know the other party. Talking to friends always gets him a - 'but he was so nice'. Of course he'd go out with nice people. Were they expecting him to go out with murderers and serial killers? Even those would be nice if they wanted to but that's not the point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inoo, however, just outright cursed them and told him they could all fuck off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I could tell him I have been cheating on him for a long time," Inoo slurred, turning to his side to face him. "And I called to tell him I wanna break up."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Or you could tell him he's not a lost since you could have literally anyone the moment you become available," Takaki said smugly, pointing to himself to make a point. Inoo laughed at that and laughed some more as he struggled to somehow crawl to him and put his head on his lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Makes it sound like I have a long line of men waiting for my hand," Inoo answered, closing his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly. So he knows what he's lost," Takaki nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were having a happy time - a good time - on the floor just talking when he suddenly heard the other sniffle and when he looked, he's curled towards him, crying on his lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey, are you alright?" Yuya asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I loved him, you know?" Kei said, sniffling. "He was a shitty man but he made me happy,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He did?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Made me feel special," the crying man nodded. "Thought I finally found the man for me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Takaki only hummed and placed a hand on his back, feeling him shake a bit more. "But I'm really thinking of breaking it up," the man confessed. "Lately, he's started feeling cold and far and I thought maybe I was the issue. I asked him about it but he said there was nothing wrong but he kept on being cold and I thought - maybe he's not happy with me anymore," the man went on, "Maybe I should let him go and let him find happiness and then - I called him and heard someone else and I was just - " he sobbed and curled a little tighter towards Takaki who pulled him as much as he could with his arms feeling like jelly. Just for comfort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You figured he's being cold because there's already someone else," Yuya concluded and the answering nod was enough. "A good thing you told him he's garbage, then. Because he is," Yuya said comfortingly, deciding that if the man's curled on his lap then he can rub his back to make him feel better. "No good man would do that. If he doesn't love you or if he wants someone else, he should've told you," Yuya said. "Honesty is the least he could do."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Do you think I made the right decision breaking up with him?" Inoo asked a little later when they both fell quiet and the only sound they could hear was the waking city.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you feel like it was the right decision?" Inoo nodded his answer. "Then you made the right decision. You can't control your feelings but you can control when you lie," Yuya explained. "And he chose to lie," he continued. "I know there will be a night when you feel like you should get back with him because you miss him. Because you used to be good for each other. But I also want you to remember about the choices he had made that hurt you," Yuya said. Inoo nodded quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You celebrated tonight because you're happy to be rid of a cheater. Always remember that," Yuya said, running a hand through the man's hair, smiling softly when he began to hear his gentle snores, the sun finally peeking from the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Inoo woke up on the couch to a clean living room and kitchen, a glass of water on his coffee table.</span>
