        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Okay so hear me out - first, happy new year, second, I have been thinking about this au since 2023 rolled in but I have no idea how to write it and to get this out my system, this is happening.<br/>Also, the main idea was actually the last chapter for this - the +1 - and I really have no idea how to lead to that so, if you think this is as carelessly written as the others I have, yes. Because I just really wanna get to the end without bothering about the others. This is me pretending I know what I'm doing to get to the end. Like life but that's not the point.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>I.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The name Ogata Yamato has been popular in the racing world for quite some time now. He's known for his elusiveness and the numerous rumors surrounding the faceless racer. Only his name is out there. Even that, nobody is sure is true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He's kind - as far as kindness goes. He's polite enough to maintain a certain air of professionalism about him that somehow makes him untouchable and others a little uncomfortable. There is a feeling of detachedness about him that makes people want to know more yet hesitant enough to ask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That's why when Inoo was assigned to interview him after the upcoming competition, he did all he could to convince his superior to assign it to someone else. Preferably a senior. Or anyone who is not a rookie and is confident enough to look at the signature dark helmet of the man who only ever answers yes-no questions about anything about things he wants to keep private.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that it's hard to interview Ogata Yamato but he's really trying to keep his streak of 'days without anything embarrassing happening to him.'</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That and the fact that he may have a teensy tiny crush on the man. He has not seen his face but Inoo's always had a thing for nice voices and Ogata's voice is certainly something he enjoyed listening to during his intern days when he would listen to his muffled interviews and transcribe them as part of his school project. He only wished the man removed his helmet to answer but can't blame him for keeping it on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Add the fact that he's passionate about societal issues and Inoo's always a sucker for people who could stand their ground about things they are passionate about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This is bullshit. The man's probably been asked this a million times now," Inoo groaned as he paced back and forth inside the empty room in a more deserted wing of the venue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Part of the preparation for the competition, the reporters are also invited to see the venue to cover the preparation for the event and interview anyone they would see in the place prepping for the big day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Every other reporter in this venue probably has the same set of questions. What made them think this is a good - why do I have to do this?" he exclaimed, rubbing his face. "Sure, let's make the rookie interview Ogata Yamato. If this goes south, it's easy to blame him for messing up and fire him -"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello!" another voice said and Inoo froze, turning slowly to see a long haired man smiling at the door. "I was just passing by. Are you okay?" the man asked, walking slowly towards him, hands in a gesture that was meant to seem friendly. "I heard you were going to interview Ogata but you sounded frustrated,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, and?" Inoo deadpanned, turning so as to seem aloof.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would've thought you'd be excited seeing almost every other reported I've heard so far sounded excited to be interviewing him," the man revealed and that made Inoo turn around, revealing worry on his face and the sudden flood of uncertainty much like the day he was told he would be interviewing Ogata Yamato.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They are? I mean, yeah I know they are - I mean, that's Ogata Yamato!" Inoo rambled, a quick change from the aloofness he wanted the stranger to perceive. "Did you hear what questions they were gonna ask?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not really. But I assume it's the same set they ask each year," the man shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. "It's literally the same ones with a few variations year after year anyway," he chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, I suppose I'm going to be one more man asking him the same questions this year," Inoo sighed, glancing at the notepad in his hand. "Just between us? I don't know how they could be excited about that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maybe because it's an annual thing?" the man politely offered and Inoo could do nothing but agree.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why don't you rephrase your questions?" The man asked, Takaki Yuya, suggested after hearing his set of questions and his qualms about them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I did tell you my superiors want me to ask these exact questions, right?" Inoo chuckled humorously, the grumbles he had not an inside joke he had with the stranger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know but they just want the answers to those questions if you think of it," the man said. "So why not rephrase them? Get the same answers using different questions?" the man said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a good suggestion and he considered it, brainstorming with the man on how the questions should be presented.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you so much for helping me, Takaki-san. I would've just been angry the entire day if you didn't help me," Inoo sighed, packing his things up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Happy to be of help. It was a problem I knew I could assist in,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You assisted plenty. That's for sure," Inoo chuckled as they made their way out the room and into the empty hallway. Tomorrow, that place would be filled with people rushing about to get to their seats or wherever they need to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's a relief. Just remember that Ogata-san is not special. He's just like you and me," Takaki said comfortingly, making Inoo laugh this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He probably goes home to his shelves of victory cups at home while I to my packs of instant ramen in a broken fridge. But sure. Just like you and me," he said a little sarcastically but humorously enough to make the other man laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who knows? He might be eating ramen out of those cups just to feel something," Takaki winked and this time, Inoo laughed freely - the first one since getting the task.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Congratulations on your victory, Ogata-san!" Inoo cheerfully greeted when the man was escorted to the designated spot where he would be interviewed. "You performance was remarkable!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Inoo-san," the man only said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hearing his muffled voice in recording and interviews did no justice hearing him live albeit muffled still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You've been doing this for years - surely you don't feel nervous anymore after winning so many times," Inoo said, replacing a question he remembers Takaki said he personally hates hearing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ogata paused, as if to think, before turning to him - making Inoo think he has his entire attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I still do, actually," the man answered. "I feel nervous just looking at the track but I suppose I'm just luckier than most."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I wouldn't call that getting lucky but if you're adamant on being modest -"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man laughed. Actually laughed. Like his shoulder shook with that laughter that everybody else paused to watch and listen because Ogata Yamato doesn't laugh. He huffs and hums but never laughs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am - " the man said, still chuckling, " - adamant on being modest," the man said. "At this point, I am operating on luck and a little motivation,"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"What are your plans now?" Inoo asked, still quite speechless from the man's chattiness. This has been the chattiest Ogata has been and he hardly asked questions!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Honestly? Just take the cup, go home, and eat ramen in it to really savor the moment," Takaki said and Inoo couldn't help but laugh as the man made the gesture that seemed like he winked and he couldn't think of anything else but how adorable that was. "I really wanna stay with you but they are already signaling me to go."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course. Thank you for sparing us your time, Ogata-san," Inoo smiled - almost grinned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll see you on the next race, Inoo-san,"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>His paycheck after that very successful interview was more than enough to get him a new fridge and some things to put in it to last him till the next pay.</span>

  <span>II.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The last interview did so well that he was being sent once more to do another. Apparently, the last one made a buzz online - enough that if you look Ogata's name up, the first video search result is his. A few other sites also used his video - crediting him of course - and writing about how Ogata Yamato has finally decided to reveal another side of him other than his usual serious, gloomy, and quiet persona unlike some of his peers who often appeared to be fueled by adrenaline.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps he just caught Ogata in a good time. Perhaps he was just lucky - a rookie's luck, he calls it - and perhaps this time, he won't be as lucky anymore as to get the same reaction from the man like the last time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Focusing on the now, Inoo found himself holding on to the competition programme, pacing back and forth inside an empty room somewhere there were not many people going about. Much like the last time, they were being invited to cover the proceedings before the event to broadcast how the preparations are going and how the racers are gearing themselves up and putting themselves in a competition mood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Prior, he got to talk to a few racers and they asked him if Ogata's shared with him a few secrets - in the spirit of good humor and teasing, of course, seeing that he's become quite the name among players as the one who has managed to get a reaction from their biggest competition yet. But now that's done and he's back in his little bubble, gearing himself up to talk to Ogata because Ogata does not do interviews before the race. He only does them after. And in that case, he has to make everything count.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I had a good feeling I'd find you here," a voice said and Inoo was smiling before he could even turn around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Takaki-san!" Inoo greeted, the bounce on his step going thankfully unnoticed by both parties. "You have no idea how glad I am to see you,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"As am I. Prepping for later?" the man asked, gesturing towards the chair so they could both sit down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt almost natural - the interaction. Two strangers who are suddenly familiar after a meeting they were not anticipating. A good experience that has led to where he is -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. Thanks to you, I am once more in this dilemma," he chuckled albeit teasingly, the other man catching on pretty quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's not my fault you did an exemplary job the last time," the man said in mocked defense, "But honestly? I was really impressed. You took a mile the inch you were given."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You are really underestimating the help you gave me," Inoo shook his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He told him about his experience, how high that one left him after and what he needed to do to come down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I honestly wished you were there to talk me through it," Inoo admitted, fidgeting in his seat as he allowed the stranger to see him being quite vulnerable. "The interview itself wasn't the problem - it was what came after. I guess I left myself too unchecked that I sort of felt lost after that interaction." Inoo revealed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you talk to anyone about this?" Takaki asked and the other man shook his head. "Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me this. Going back, why do you think you felt that way?"</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is it okay if I ask for your number?" Inoo braved, already bracing himself for the kind 'no' he knew was headed his way. It was absolutely foolish after all - asking this man for his number when the only thing they have in common is the fact that Inoo needs and he gives. Aside from that, they don't really -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure. As long as I get yours in return," Takaki answered, which made Inoo pause.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am," the man chuckled, taking his phone out. "You better give me your number now before I change my mind about giving mine to you."</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good luck later!" Takaki grinned, holding his phone up. "Let's talk after your interview, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll take you up on that. Thank you, Takaki-san!" Inoo smiled and waved, watching the man head towards the tents where the racers and the crew would be, prepping for the big race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only now that he finally noticed that the man was wearing an all black suit - he does remember seeing that from one of the racer's crew. He's probably part of that new kid in town Meguro who has his entire crew in black.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This world changes as quickly as its drivers. One minute Ogata is the biggest name and the next thing you know, there's another rising star not too far behind.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Another win!" Inoo cheered when Ogata in all his black suit glory was near enough to hear him. "Congratulations, Ogata-san!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm inclined to believe that as long as you are here to congratulate me after, I'm bound to win," Takaki returned easily, making Inoo blush. But he's a professional, of course. He easily tamped that giddy feeling and focused on pointing out that he didn't peg him as someone who believed in lucky charms but only in innate luck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was very sure I was gonna lose. Did you see my tire give in earlier?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I did! Everyone was at the edge of their seats when it exploded a mere second away from your pit stop!" Inoo frowned, glancing towards the now empty tracks. He does remember the collective gasp when his right back tire gave in before he could even properly reach the stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It set me back 4 seconds," the man's muffled voice answered. "But I thought, it'd be embarrassing to face you if I don't win."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It feels more like I'm a threat than a good luck charm," Inoo teased back and laughed, laughing a little louder when the man put a hand on his helmet as if to scratch it.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"How do you plan to celebrate tonight's win, Ogata-san?" Inoo got on to the final question. "Ramen in the cup?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you'll join me, that's a plan. If not, I'll probably just go out with my crew somewhere," the man answered and he's pretty sure - no. Can't be. Is it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Really now, Ogata-san," Inoo laughed, a little nervous, "Surely there's a better way to celebrate. The night's young!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He only shrugged, putting a gentle hand on his head. "They want me to go. See you next time?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"See you around, Ogata-san,"</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When he got home, there was already a message waiting for him for a new found friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Takaki Yuya 07:39 PM:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; do u want him to stop?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; I can do it</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the interview, he told Takaki that the way Ogata answered him felt like he was flirting with him. Of course, he didn't want to be presumptuous but he couldn't help but feel that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of the usual 'get your head out the clouds' that his friends would definitely say, the man expressed concern about his comfort and if only -</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">
  <span>I'm fine Takaki-san</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>honest? I feel flattered he would think I'm even worth the attention</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>if he was actually flirting</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>I saw the groupies he tries so hard to ignore</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>he definitely has better options</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; If u think that way then ure in d wrong field</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; arent reporters supposed to be observant?</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>I AM observant</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>that's why I think he's flirting with me</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; then y do u think he has better options</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; when there's u</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; d best he could possibly get</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That gave Inoo a pause. Only because he needed a moment to calm himself down because that last set of messages is definitely doing something to him and now he can't stop himself from smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ok so he thinks that man is cute but that's beside the point. They just met!</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">
  <span>careful now, Takaki-san</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>that was a really smooth one</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; was it?</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>it was</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>definitely smooth</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>YOU should flirt with ME</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>and drop smooth one-liners like that</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; dun worry</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; I'll make em smoother</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; so you'll slip and fall for me</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; HAHAHAHAHA</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>now you're just pushing it</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>HAHAHAHA</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; I am</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; kidding aside, offer stands</span>
</p><p>
  <span>&gt;&gt; it stops when ure not comfy</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>I'm fine, Takaki-san</span>
</p><p align="right">
  <span>Thank you</span>

</p><p>"I'm surprised you got what I meant," Inoo said surprised when not five minutes later, Takaki joined him with some snacks too!</p><p>"We've had this rendezvous twice now," Takaki looked at him knowingly and they chuckled.</p><p>Their snacks were quite grand - sandwiches with hefty fillings in them and some bottled water.</p><p>"Why are we eating like we're going to race?" Inoo asked, bowing his thanks when the man gave him some on a make-shift plate.</p><p>"Because we are?" Takaki shrugged but ultimately left the question unanswered.</p><p>"Which team do you belong to? So I could thank them for letting me have food too," Inoo decided to tease instead, appreciating the food since he has not eaten anything that morning - and the man knows since he's been talking to him about feeling like he can't eat anything at the moment.</p><p>"Don't worry about it. We feed a battalion so I think they won't notice," Takaki smiled.</p><p> </p><p>This is going to be Inoo's third interview. Much like the other two, he's nervous but at least he knows what to look forward to. And he has this man who -</p><p>"Say, Inoo-san," Takaki spoke, pulling him from his thoughts. "What if you knew Ogata Yamato beneath the helmet?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"What would you do? If you knew him without the helmet?" the man asked, eyes focused on his food.</p><p> </p><p>That's a good question. He hadn't really thought about it until the man asked. Ogata just always seemed untouchable to him. Like an entity that was there to race and race alone. Maybe his black head-to-toe outfit was to blame but there's something about the man - the way he stood, he walked, even talked - put him in a category that for Inoo is too far for him to reach. Nobody knows a lot about the man. It's only that he started racing recently, made a name for himself, and has a plan to retire early. That's it. He's just - if he knew him personally, he wouldn't know what to do.</p><p> </p><p>The recent developments may have changed a few things, however.</p><p>It left him thinking about knowing the man intimately, in a way. Imagining witnessing the first time he removes his helmet, smiling at him, scratching his head the way he adorably scratches his helmet when he's asked questions - maybe saying a quip or two about how how it was getting beneath it just to excuse him finally removing the blasted thing separating him from the rest of the world -</p><p>Thing is, that always leaves him imagining Takaki after. His long hair tied back to keep it away from his face and when he finally removes his helmet, he'll be shaking his head to loosen the hair out and he'll be holding the thing on his waist and -</p><p>"Inoo-san?" Takaki said, shaking him from that image. "You're staring,"</p><p>"Right, uh, sorry, uh," Inoo said, taking a sharp breath in. "Um, I don't know, actually," he decided to say, picking up their conversation as if nothing happened. "I guess I'll take pictures like everybody else."</p><p>"Right," the man said, still eating. He really brought a lot of snacks. "What do you think he looks like?"</p><p>A good fucking question because this entire time, Inoo sees Takaki in his head once Ogata's helmet is off.</p><p> </p><p>When he was still just transcribing his interviews, he never really thought about what he would look like. He just enjoyed the voice and that's it. But now -</p><p>"I don't know. Maybe he looks like you," Inoo shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant about it but he noticed Takaki froze for a few seconds before chuckling.</p><p>"Would it be okay if he looked like me?"</p><p>Inoo snorted. "Of course it would be okay. In case you haven't seen yourself in a mirror, you look good," Inoo said as platonically as he could, trying his hardest not to let his budding attraction bleed into his words. And failing spectacularly. Might as well own up to it. "If Ogata-san looks half as good as you are, he'd be lucky."</p><p>"Careful now, Inoo-san. I might think you're flirting with me," the man chuckled. "Wouldn't want to be in a competition with Ogata-san."</p><p>"You should be. You have high chances of winning," Inoo shrugged, keeping his features aloof although inside, he was everything but.</p><p>"Would those chances go down if I was actually Ogata-san?" Takaki asked. "Just wondering," he shrugged.</p><p>"If you are him, then you should keep flirting with me. Invite me over again tonight for some ramen," Inoo dared, not really looking at the man now. "Takaki-san under Ogata-san's helmet has some really good chances," he said.</p><p>"If it was someone else?"</p><p>"I don't know. I only like strangers who help me and bring me snacks," Inoo said and turned and was happy he did because Takaki was blushing and biting his lips, staring at his sandwich as if pondering something.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Wish me good luck," Takaki said before they part ways, like lovers about to return to their families after a secret rendezvous, a shy smile, bright eyes - Okay sue him he's a romantic.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Just do it," Takaki smiled and really, this limbo they have put themselves into is another thing for Inoo to think about once he's home.</p><p>"Good luck, Takaki-san," Inoo smiled, albeit confused. "Do your best today."</p><p>"I will," Takaki grinned and ran along, his black suit standing out in the middle of the bright field of reds, whites, and yellows.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Much like the last race, everyone was left gasping on the edge of their seats when once more, Ogata's tires exploded. It placed him at a 5-second disadvantage but as if by miracle, the man snatched the first place once more, lifted by his crew as if the hero that saved the day.</p><p> </p><p>"You are definitely something else, Ogata-san," Inoo remarked when the man was finally close enough to hear him. "You've got to be connected to some higher power somewhere."</p><p>"Luck, I tell you. Did I make you nervous?"</p><p>"You made EVERYBODY nervous," Inoo emphasized, the hand on his chest feeling his quickly beating heart. "What happened out there?"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"And how are you feeling after that - THAT?" Inoo chuckled a little breathless, listening to the man explain what happened and how he dealt with it on the track.</p><p>"Right now? I'm just relieved I could stand here and tell you I won," Takaki answered with a sigh, his shoulders falling and suddenly, Inoo noticed the suit he was wearing. The tiny dark purple detail peeking out at the hem -</p><p>"I won, Inoo-san,"</p><p> </p><p>"Congratulations, Ogata-san," Inoo answered, as if on default. He didn't dare move in case he did something inappropriate for the camera.</p><p>"Thank you. Ramen at my place later?" He asked, tone changing. "The cup's really big. We could put some tofu on it and some veggies and meat," the man said, making motions with his hands which he doesn't typically do. Then his right hand flew to his helmet and as if suddenly, Inoo was seeing a different man.</p><p>Someone he knew.</p><p>"I might take you up on that this time. All with that veggie temptation," Inoo answered and the man laughed, waving as he was ushered to his next interview.</p><p>
  <br/>

  <p>IV.</p><p> </p><p>"We really gotta stop meeting like this,"</p><p> </p><p>Inoo turned around smiling, laughing when the man raised the bag of snacks he was carrying, a mischievous glint in his eyes.</p><p>"Stop looking for me when I don't want to be found," Inoo teased as he settled across the man. He doesn't really know what kind of place the room was but there was a bench and they could put the food between them.</p><p> </p><p>After his last message, Takaki didn't reply. Actually, he felt like he was left in a limbo of 'maybe he shouldn't have said anything' and 'dammit you should've told me right at the beginning' and it's not a pretty place.</p><p>He chose not to send any messages too and months passed with nothing - not even the usual greeting in the morning they have silently agreed to do in between when there's a lull in excitement and racers do what they do.</p><p>He kinda missed him. But also, he knows the conversation that needs to be had.</p><p>"I can't help it. My feet naturally carry me towards you," Takaki answered and this time, Inoo let himself blush.</p><p>"I thought that only happens after a race. Part of the process and all," Inoo tried, not looking. But at his peripheral, he saw Takaki stop and look up.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you mad?" he asked quietly and it sounded almost as if he was scared. Gone was the cheery, kind, Takaki he knew and the confident Ogata he talks to.</p><p>This is just -</p><p>"You could've told me sooner," Inoo said, finally looking back at him. "Did you not trust me to keep it a secret?"</p><p>"I was - how did you figure it out?" Takaki said, sighing, as if he wanted to say something else but chose differently, maybe having all those considerations in his mind. He's kept his identity this long after all.</p><p>"Would you believe it's the hem of your suit?" Inoo chuckled, reaching out a cautious hand to trace the dark purple peeking from the hem. "I didn't notice it before because it's always darker when we talk and I see you during the day. But last time, the lights were particularly bright and I noticed the purple hemming," Inoo explained. "Couldn't brush it off as Meguro-san's after that."</p><p>"And here I thought I was being obvious with all the verbal hints," Takaki chuckled, watching that careful hand retreat. "Are you sure you should be a reporter?" he teased.</p><p>"I observe 'other people' towards 'other people', Takaki-san. Not 'other people' towards me," Inoo responded, rolling his eyes but ultimately cackling when Takaki did the same. "Also, the ramen invitation would've been a big give away if I got on later."</p><p>"I was counting on that," Yuya smiled, pushing the other sandwich towards the other man. "Should we keep that inside joke going? Are you comfortable with me flirting?" Takaki asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Were YOU flirting?" Inoo decided to say after a beat, gauging Takaki's reaction. "I thought it was Ogata-san flirting. Takaki-san is a little wussy I have to give an explicit 'permission to flirt' to," he said, picking up that teasing tone he had before finding out all of this. "I'd appreciate it if YOU were actually flirting."</p><p>"You're difficult," Takaki laughed. "Fine. As Ogata Yamato, can I keep flirting with you?"</p><p>"I know a few people who would be so jealous right now," Inoo only laughed.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"I'm not gonna tell you good luck this time," Inoo said before they parted ways. "That last time I did that, you lost 5 seconds."</p><p>"What are you gonna say, then? to motivate me?" Takaki dared, raising a brow.</p><p>"I won't interview you if you get anything but first place," Inoo answered, crossing his arms to answer that dare.</p><p>"Good," Takaki smirked. "I wasn't planning on losing."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Disappointing your fans is one thing you're bad at," Inoo laughed when the man walked to him and immediately placed a hand on his head. "Congratulations on another success, Ogata-san!"</p><p>"Apparently, I'm bad at being obvious too. But that aside, thank you, Inoo-san,"</p><p> </p><p>"No seconds lost, and more than enough to spare. How are you feeling about this win?" Inoo asked, feeling himself settle in where he was standing. He knows this man. He doesn't feel as scared. And his high is comfortably tethered to the ground.</p><p>"Pretty good, if I'm being honest. This race has been the biggest pressure on me so far,"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Yep. Getting anything but the championship title was not an option. At least I was told," Ogata said and there was a certain lilt to his tone that Inoo knew was a teasing jab at him from earlier.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"The next race is not until the next season. What do you plan to do in the interim? More training?" Inoo asked finally.</p><p>"Probably. If I'm lucky, I could finally learn to make something better than a bowl of ramen," Ogata-san expressed, turning to Inoo. "Perhaps you could teach me some cooking tricks?"</p><p>"I could definitely refer you to a friend. He's been bringing me great snacks lately," Inoo answered knowingly, still the joke remaining between them.</p><p>"Sounds awesome,"</p><p>"See you around, Ogata-san,"</p><p>

  <p>
  <span>V.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Congratulations, Ogata-san!" Inoo greeted, chuckling when the man only put a hand on his head as thanks. "I know this season has been tough but as always, you came through,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I like being bad at something - like disappointing people," Ogata answered and not only did Inoo laugh, the people that gathered around them laughed too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Really now, Ogata-san," he laughed, "But really. How did you prepare this season? I heard you went through a specific program?"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"You won't be racing in the next couple of seasons, we were told. So, what are your plans after this?" Inoo-san, glancing at Ogata's coach, sending a thumbs up their way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Training, still. I can't stop doing that or my coach would strangle me," Ogata chided his coach's way. "But I also want to explore other aspects of my life outside racing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hobbies, perhaps?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure. Cooking. So next time I invite you to eat ramen with me, you won't hesitate to say yes," the man said, the tilt of his head in that teasing manner than made Inoo laugh unexpectedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't hesitate last time," Inoo responded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, but we didn't really follow through with that, did we?" The man asked, glancing at the man already signaling him to go to the next reporter. "Perhaps just a normal dinner invitation somewhere else would work this time?"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn't know how he never recognized the voice seeing he listened to him for a couple of good semesters. But then again, a voice sounds different, muffled and not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're staring," Takaki said after a few beats of silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How much have they been talking on the phone lately? How much have they left each other voice messages and he still sounds nothing like the Ogata he listened to before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, I'm not," Inoo denied, turning back to his chips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know I'm your type but damn," Takaki teased and he would have blushed. He used to. But now it's just a usual banter between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Inoo thinks back about how they came to this point, he'd say it turned out better than he was expecting from a really popular guy and a man on the field such as himself. They don't get a lot of time together - Yuya has to train and he has to work - but they've cultivated an easy kind of friendship with a side of flirting in the interim.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that Yuya openly flirts with him, it's quite hard to keep up the aggressiveness he used to have. Often, he finds himself speechless when Takaki drops a line and he doesn't look like he is and he's just - oh. Oh that's smooth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't let it get into your head. You're not special," Inoo grumbled, drinking the soda the other man gave him with as much spite as he could.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They aren't dating - is it called dating when all you do with the guy you like, and likes you back, is flirt and have long phone conversations and silly voice messages and text messages read later in the day? not that Inoo has not dated anyone but he hasn't dated for a long time and this feels like a territory he should be careful in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's a conversation they aren't really having. Suppose they are just enjoying what they have, wordlessly offering themselves to the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ouch," Takaki said mockingly, a hand to his chest. "And here I am building an altar for you in my place because you're special."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's creepy," Inoo laughed, watching the other laugh too. They aren't even - This isn't a date. Eating leftover snacks on the side of the track while the staff cleaned up and everybody geared up to go home isn't a date. Talking about senseless stuff and bantering isn't a date. Telling your colleague you have to do something and pretending to have gone home so they'd go ahead of you while the other person lies about wanting to do some warm downs after the adrenaline of the race but really he's just spending time with you isn't a date.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This isn't a date.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So why does it feel like it is one?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He basically asked him to dinner on camera and he already has a pretty good idea of what his boss would say, the comments section, the - anyway. He focused on the now, Yaotome's voice calling to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We're ready to go. You guys good?" he asked as he approached them, a certain knowing look on his face as he looked at Takaki. "By the way, if you see someone you know in the tent, you don't say a word, understand?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Inoo refrained from saying anything when he saw Yabu in the tent helping out. He did promise. </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just to spice it up," Ogata said when he took the microphone from Inoo who laughed at his antics.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How was the race, Inoo-san?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was definitely nerve-wracking, Ogata-san. You pulled a stunt I am sure nobody would've in the middle of the track," Inoo answered, shrugging at people giving him questioning looks as they looked at Ogata holding the microphone this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Were you impressed?" Ogata asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Definitely! I have always been impressed by you but your performance tonight has got to be the best so far," Inoo nodded, voice edging that laughter he is trying his best to keep down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you think you'd consider going out with me after that stunt I pulled earlier on the track?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Inoo froze, looking at his reflection on that darkened helmet, knowing full well how the man behind it looked, ignoring the cheer that suddenly exploded around them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uhm..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Perhaps I was not clear - I was trying to impress you to get you to agree to go on a date with me. Do you think you'd consider?" Ogata asked, louder so the microphone would pick his voice up clearly in the midst of the cheers from his team and the others who are now catching up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What are you doing, Ogata-san?" Inoo asked and for the first time - the very first time on camera - the man removed his helmet, hair flowing - he's pretty sure he's been planning to do this or he wouldn't look that good after removing his helmet. Takaki grinned after squinting through the sudden brightness a bit but ultimately sent him a conspiratorial wink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm asking you out. Properly. And maybe with the goal of putting a label to what we have so I could finally say 'I have to meet my boyfriend after training'," Ogata said and really - what were they expecting Inoo to do if not grab the man and kiss him?</span>
