      <p>Hiiii! I’m so so sorry in advance if it’s a little out of the place, but I got too many ideas on my process of writing and it ended up like this. I really hope you'll enjoy this (very short, imo) YutoYama story! Lots of love! &lt;3</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>We could hear the two young adults moaning, painting. Their skin were bumping on each other, ever since they passed through the entrance of their apartment.</p><p>Yuto was kissing his boyfriend, Ryosuke, like there was literally no tomorrow. Is it because of the love and sexual tension that was building up throughout the podcast episode that the taller one was doing a few hours ago?</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>“What’s turns you on about your boyfriend, Yuya?” Daiki asked while looking at his friend with a teasing look.</p><p>At this question, Yamada, who was in the room, off cam (because it was filmed to post it on YouTube), spit out his Lemola sip, not without coughing, which surprised Nakajima and his friends. He quickly reassured them by making a positive sign with his hand.</p><p>“Well, if it doesn’t sound too cocky or such” Yuya starts his sentence, speaking with his low voice that could make shiver anyone, “I love seeing his desire for me when I look into his eyes after a while not seeing each other. Just that little thing is enough to turn me on.”</p><p>“And not only that… just sharing a moment on intimacy with him, either by kissing him, taking a bath together, anything like that… it makes me love them more and more”</p><p>Yuto bites Yama’s neck as he thrust in and out his man’s butt slowly. He wanted to feel him shiver under him, to feel how much he missed him.</p><p>He stops his kiss to bite his lobe, slowly. He could hear Ryosuke moan louder and it turned him on more.</p><p>“I can see that I’m not the only one who was needy… that’s cute” He whispers into his ear, making Ryosuke kiss him again.</p><p>“It’s not my fault if you’re too hot, even behind your mic- ahhhhh” His moan was higher than the other ones. He kissed Yuto again, trying to refrain his screams to not disturb the neighbours.</p><p>“It’s pretty basic, but I really like when she’s only wearing one of my hoodies, with only her underwear” Keito says, while blushing really hard. “When she hugs me tighter as we kiss each other… when I can feel he breath speed up as I kiss her neck or when like Yuya, we’re having a very intimate moment together. When I’m just with her, actually.” He concludes his thoughts while looking away, as his usual.</p><p>Yuto repositioned himself into Yamada and started to thrust again, making him moan again, louder than before.</p><p>“I love it when she goes against me” Daiki stated, a smirk that he couldn’t hide on his face. “I don’t know if it’s the fact that she’s younger or that she has a head on her shoulders that I don’t always have, but she has something about her that makes me want to kiss her and more every. single. time that she’s in the same room as me.”</p><p>The older of the two looked at him straight into his eyes and said:</p><p>“I… I think I’m-“ He was interrupted by an orgasm so powerful that he almost screamed, spilling out between Yuto and him.</p><p>The taller of the two continued to move slowly, then fast inside him, looking for his own orgasm, which would soon come sooner or later. But he wanted to come, he needed to.</p><p>Nakajima then came into Ryosuke in a groan as loud as his moan and collapsed on his side, breathing heavily.</p><p>After a couple of minutes, that appeared like hours, Yamada asked, with a husky voice:</p><p>“Ne, Yutti… what turns you on about me?”</p><p>He turned his head towards his boyfriend, looking at him as if he was asking an obvious question.</p><p>“Yama-chan… it’s been almost three years that we’re together. I could make a list about what turns me on about you.”</p><p>The young man lifted his head to look at Yuto, saying: “You’re not serious.”</p><p>“Of course I am!” He started with those words: “You turn me on with the way you’re always so determined with every single thing you’re doing. Either to make me smile when I’m at my lowest or when you want to give the best in your work. It’s so hot coming from you.” He ran a hand through Ryosuke’s sweaty red hair, like how he does every time they had sex.</p><p>“The way you can switch from being the cutest person to the sexiest person on earth in seconds makes my heart skip a beat so hardly, if you only knew. The fact that you’re signing in the shower melts me apart, when you’re so focused while driving us home, even with kids, talking to them with you’re sweet little voice!” He giggled as he can picture Yama with his nieces in his head.</p><p>“I just love you for the way you are, honestly. It has been three years and I don’t think I’ll get tired of loving you everyday.”</p><p>He looked at Ryosuke again and was instantly worried as he could see a tear coming out from his left eye. “Awww, Yama! Don’t cry, babe.” He takes the young man by his shoulders to press his against his bare chest.<br/>
“It’s just… I didn’t knew that I was that important to you.” He smiled as he wiped his tears falling put here and there.</p><p>“I could list what turned me on about you… in a second round, maybe?” He puts himself on top of Yuto, locking his arms around his neck, while bending to kiss him again.</p><p>He didn’t even need to ask for it.</p>
