  <strong>
    <em>Lovin' you's a gift tonight<br/>Lovin' you for all my life</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>“You kinda suck at this, you know.”</p><p>Kei grinned as he sipped from his glass of wine, watching as Yuya tried and struggled to neatly wrap the presents he got for his sisters, his own glass going untouched as his brow furrowed in the cutest way.</p><p>“Yeah? You think you can do any better?” Yuya bantered, glancing at him with a playful glare. “I’ve never really been that great at this.”</p><p>“Obviously,” Kei snickered as he shifted to sit beside Yuya on the floor, but instead of helping him wrap the presents he leaned his head on his shoulder. It had been a long few days of rehearsals and work, so it was nice to have this time to wind down. Tomorrow, they would be back at it but for now they were just enjoying being in each other’s presence.</p><p>“Then you should help me, because once these presents are all wrapped I’m all yours for something more fun.”</p><p>Yuya didn’t need to ask twice. Kei set his wine glass down and helped him wrap the presents he got, enjoying the warmth of his body so close.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
    <em>Oh, every day is Christmas when you're here with me<br/>You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Come, join me for a while.”</p><p>Yuto’s voice could be heard clearly from the living room where he had settled with a bowl of popcorn and a movie selected on streaming service, as well as two mugs of hot chocolate topped off with whipped cream and marshmallows. Maybe it was a bit of overkill but what was the holiday season without a bit of indulgence?</p><p>“I’ll be right there, Yutti.”</p><p>The two of them had agreed to a day with no gaming, no work and nothing else to distract them. So after going out for a while to shop and explore areas they hadn’t seen before, taking pictures and being silly, they were back at Ryosuke’s place. The two of them already had dinner a while ago and changed into their warm pajamas. Ryosuke did have to step away to take a phone call so Yuto was waiting for him so they could start a movie, the perfect cap off to their cozy day.</p><p>“Hi,” Yuto greeted him when the other came and sat beside him, grinning.</p><p>“Hi,” Ryosuke laughed, eyeing the hot chocolate. “That’s a lot of toppings. Yutti.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with that?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he shook his head as Yuto’s arm draped over his shoulder to pull him closer.</p><p>“Let’s start the movie?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Maybe they wouldn’t be able to stay awake through the whole thing, but there was something beautiful about cuddling with snacks and hot cocoa in front of the TV.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <strong>
    <em>And when you smile<br/>I can't breathe<br/>Can't believe that you're mine</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Kei-chan, come here. I want to show you something.”</p><p>The two of them had been going on more touring dates lately whenever they found the time, which wasn’t so often.</p><p>Kei had said on Music Station, that he was shining. Yuya kept thinking about that, the look on his face when he said that. Yuya was in love with him, and he was always better with actions than words so he wanted to show him.</p><p>“What is it?” Kei’s voice from behind him, muffled by the helmet that he soon pulled off and jogged over to meet him. And if there was a perfect description to the statement “he lost his breath,” Kei’s response would have nailed it.</p><p>It was kinda cheesy for him, but he knew that inside, Kei loved this kind of thing. Fairy lights strung on trees in an enclosed space, giving it a nice ambience. A space heater was placed beside a small table with candles - fake ones, because safety first - and a meal for two that was pretty much just sandwiches and drinks, but it was the thought that counted. Yuya pushed a hand through his hair, waiting for Kei’s reaction.</p><p>“I can’t believe you did this,” he commented, and when he turned to face him, that smile… Yuya felt like his breath was being taken away too. “I love it. I love you!”</p><p>Yuya met him halfway in the romantic kiss they shared, the warmth of Kei’s body pressing close and arms wrapping around his neck. Yuya thought he needed to surprise him more often.<strong><em><br/></em></strong></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>I'm safe in your arms, you're my angel, baby<br/>Every day is Christmas when you're by my side<br/>You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>When it came to the other members, sometimes Ryosuke shared his love in unorthodox ways - whether it be the tough love with Inoo and Daiki or spoiling Chinen. But when it came to Nakajima Yuto, it was different.</p><p>On stage and in public he would playfully push him away and it was partly because it actually made him shy, but partly because it was what the fans were used to. But when Yuto smiled at him or called him by his first name, it made him weak in the knees.</p><p>Ryosuke would have been happy to just have Yuto by his side - they shared a relationship that went beyond love at this point, but he considered himself lucky that it was something else they could share.</p><p>Being in love.</p><p>It showed in the way they looked at each other and their actions towards each other, it showed in the way that Yuto had a photo of them together as his phone’s homescreen and Ryosuke playfully scolding him for that because people would see it, but secretly loving it.</p><p>It showed in the way that Yuto wasn’t afraid to be real with him, vulnerable even.</p><p>The other had fallen asleep first that night while he was over and Ryosuke was playing a game, so when he quit he crept in, quiet because Yuto needed the rest. The grumbly noises he made when Ryosuke sat on the bed were cute, and his fingers immediately found their way into his long hair so he wouldn’t wake up again. He knew very well how much it calmed him down, after all.</p><p>Watching him sleep, he looked so calm and peaceful. Ryosuke knew, he was utterly and completely in love with Yuto, and it was the best thing that had ever happened to him.</p>
