    <h2 class="toc-heading">who would've thought those had meanings? (he finally figured it out)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Chinen opened his door and got an armful of Nakajima whom he was sure was being held up only by muscle memory and miracles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yuri!" he cheered, throwing his hands up and engulfing the smaller man in an unwarranted hug, the smell of alcohol on his breath not doing much to deter the other who was more than used to it by now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nakajima," Yuri only acknowledges, thankful he has been working out because good heavens, Yuto was heavy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Aw, don't be like that, cutie pie," the man pouted, leaning back to squint at him and pinch his cheek. "I was dying all night to see you!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was not," Yuri murmured, half dragging the taller man, half pulling him upright so his pretty face doesn't hit the carpeted hotel floor. "Why aren't you pestering Yamada like you always do?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall man and his best friend have had a really good thing going lately - even he noticed that - but he and Yamada have not talked about that yet. He was sure though he would know if something beyond friendship was happening between the two even without the talk but it's still better to tread carefully in case there are fresh boundaries he must not cross.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But does that really matter when the tall man himself came here to HIS room and not Yamada's? Fully aware it was him?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chinen shook his head and focused on what's in front of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Because I wanted to see you," the man pouted further, almost comically, that Yuri would've chuckled if not for the fact that he's annoyed to have been saddled with the responsibility of looking after this giant in his room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right..." Yuri decided to trail off, leaving the man alone on the loveseat near his bed before getting beneath the sheets himself to try to get some rest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He should be mad at him for even thinking he could keep up with Takaki and Inoo while drinking. Those two drank like old men and never got drunk while the rest of them drank a glass and never expected to walk straight after. Being dragged into drinking with them most absolutely ensured a drunk man well beyond the reach of clarity and sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which Nakajima Yuto embodied right now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you know I got here all by myself?" Nakajima spoke, slumped on the armrest of the chair, raising a hand to the air to gesture. "Inoo-chan said they could take me to my room but I sneaked to see you!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chinen was tired. He wants to sleep and dream of good things and wake up refreshed. He doesn't want drunk men in his hotel room telling him they sneaked to see him as if expecting him to be grateful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And that should flatter me how?" he decided to answer from where he was comfortably tucked in, already regretting the words the moment they came out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I came HERE! I wanted to see YOU!" Nakajima exclaimed as if that answered a lot of things - maybe even the most unanswerable question in the universe. Well, in his drunken brain, it made a lot of sense. "I crossed the oceans for you!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would hardly call a hallway an ocean but do go on. Profess your undying love," Yuri sighed, finally giving up and just sitting so he could keep an eye on Nakajima in case he finally decides to succumb to sweet sleep and kiss that floor with his entire face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh I will," the taller man said daringly, moving so that he was more upright and facing Chinen's way.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>By the end of his speech, Chinen was red in the face, almost on the verge of rolling over and begging the floor to swallow him whole because Nakajima definitely knew how to use words to express what he was thinking. He was sober enough to recount in detail the way Yuri's hair fell just right over his eyes that when he looked up at him, he felt more than tempted to lean down and devour his lips in a heated kiss that would stay with him for days - how he has to hold himself like a man holding back a famish lion from devouring Chinen Yuri. He was definitely coherent enough to tell Yuri what he thought exactly of his arms and his hands and his lips - boy does the man have a fixation on his lips. All the ways he would kiss him and in places he'd imagined doing it too -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Who knew a man like him actually had the capacity to think that way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nakajima did not stop. He did not shut up. He kept on rambling about the clothes he wears and how he particularly likes the tight ones he wore underneath and the shorts that practically flaunted how muscular his calves were - the man shamelessly told him how he would show his devotion to those calves alone and then there's his thighs and his moan - if Chinen was not looking, he'd have thought he was touching himself at the thought of his thighs alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are not going to remember any of this tomorrow," Chinen chuckled under his breath when he heard Nakajima struggle with his clothing, removing it because it was too hot although the room was very cold because Yuri likes snuggling into his blanket, thank you very much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I wouldn't," the other man agreed so seriously Chinen had to lift his head and see if the man was still slumped on the chair drunk with how sober he sounded</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But you can make it memorable."</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Chinen did not make it memorable. Instead, he turned and watched Yuto struggle on the loveseat before pitying him and moving him to the space next to him in bed. The man was so smashed he couldn't even move his legs to take advantage of the freely given situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yuri," he whined, lifting an arm up to reach him to no avail. "Baby please hug me. I'm cold."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you want me to warm you up?" Chinen deadpanned, amused when the drunken man grinned, nodding vigorously despite his sorry state.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of whatever that question promised, the blanket was only raised until it was tucked beneath Yuto's chin and he was pouting, whining softly as he tried to fight exhaustion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you behave, I promise to reward your efforts," Yuri almost purred and that got Nakajima to sit still for once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that also lead to him falling asleep and it was more amusing than it should've been but Yuri was already tired and would really like that sleep now, drunk man next to him or not.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Yuri woke up earlier than the other and he relished the fact that he could mess up with him better this way. Just to retaliate, of course, for ruining his night by barging in drunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snuggled up to him and woke him up by lightly tracing random patterns on the man's skin. When felt the man take a sharp breath in, he sighed, as if in contentment, and hummed something pleased. He's not just a singer, he's also an actor. And a damn good one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What...?" He heard Yuto breathe before reaching a hesitant arm to wrap around him while he lazily laid on his chest, still purring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Morning, sleepy head," Yuri rasped, voice just scratchy enough that it hinted at a lot of things that could be conceived by the more imaginative. "You wore me out last night."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I... did?" Yuto asked, sounding more confused than cocky and really, he knows why but he'll try to prolong the fun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mhmm," Yuri nodded, still making those senseless patterns, only now they were more suggestive than before. "I'm ruined for others - "</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chinen almost laughed at the comical intake of breath from the man beneath him but he kept his facade. He knew this could only end well but he wasn't willing to let go of the fun. He'll just have to talk to Yama-chan first thing later and tell him what happened so he knows Yuto's not cheating if they are indeed actually together at the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>" - can't easily forget you - well, you know." Chinen rumbled, this time, really driving the point home by scratching at his flesh - enough of a promise and a reminder of a memory that doesn't exist in Yuto's head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Absolutely baffled by just what was happening, Yuto played along and simply kept still, waiting for Yuri to go on.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Chinen knew Yuto was waiting for him to make the next move. He 'can't remember' what happened last night and if it was as good as Yuri claims, Yuri will make a move to have a repeat, right? He won't have to reveal that he can't really remember how he even ended up in Chinen's room in the first place when he could only clearly remember Inoo offering to walk him to his room. He'll have to rely on Yuri's cues to see where this was going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But Yuri was going to lead him nowhere. There was nowhere to go. But it was too fun and he just -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Time to get up. Work day ahead," Yuri sighed as if detaching himself from his warmth was truly a loss. He even leaned down to leave a lingering kiss on his forehead - like a promise that they'll pick up where they left off as soon as they could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only there was nothing to pick up because there was nowhere they left off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Yuto didn't have to know that just yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Making his way to the bathroom, he suggestively stretched his back, groaning just right to give him an idea that he aches in all the right places.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're a lunatic," Yamada laughed when he got him alone in the cafeteria with Fuma. Fuma didn't really care - he's had his bit of fun with a certain senior we will not be naming - and as long as nobody's talking about him, he ain't talking about anybody else either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am funny and you know it," Chinen said, turning to Fuma for backup which the man gladly gave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He opened the conversation by asking if there was anything going on between him and Nakajima. When it was a negative, he proceeded to tell him about what transpired the night before and watched his reaction go from worried to surprised to plain disbelieving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So that's why he's been staring at you earlier," Yamada said after calming down. "Like he can't decide if he should go to you or stay away from you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If he's smart, he'd know what he should do," Yuri shrugged.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Turns out, Nakajima ain't so smart as to have even a clue of what to do. He stayed a safe distance away but he also hovered - he's always around. Everywhere Yuri went, he was there. A few hours into the day, it was amusing. Towards the end, Yuri wanted nothing but to get rid of him ANY way possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's what you get for making him think something happened," Yamada said reprimandingly and he had every right to do so; this is his fault. He probably should've told him earlier than he was just messing around with him but the day got the better of him and took any more alone time away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know. I'm telling him tonight that I was just messing up with him," Yuri breathed, looking up only to bow while the other members started leaving, nodding his goodbye to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I suggest you tell him now. If I'm correct, he's waiting for you by the door," Yamada murmured, tilting his head towards the direction of the door where Nakajima stood, more fidgety than usual.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A curse under his breath and he was off, leaving Yamada with Arioka who was on the other side of the room, chatting with Inoo and Takaki.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"We need to talk," Nakajima finally said after some silence. Sure enough, both of them knew that talking while walking is not good and so they waited until they are both safe within the confines of Chinen's hotel room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's why you're here," the shorter one stated, putting his dirty clothes in the laundry bag he will be bringing home soon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a lot of awkwardness that Yuri could've scooped it up with his hands were it something physical. Nakajima bounced on his heel and paced a little before finally sitting somewhere near him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Yuri is right about what he wants to say - and were it actually the case - sitting near him would've been the worst option. He's small but he packs a punch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know last night was - was something," Nakajima started, not even bothering to get Yuri's attention from all the dirty laundry folding he's been doing, "And this morning - well, ugh," he groaned, grabbing his hair with his hands in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't remember any of it. I can't remember getting in your room, I can't remember 'tiring you out' - hell I can't remember anything past telling Inoo-chan I can stand up by myself - "</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nakajima stopped when Yuri snorted, looking every bit in the world trying to stop himself from laughing. "Chii?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I could punch you right now," Yuri smiled, finally looking at Yuto. "If it really mattered, I could've punched you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you mean?"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Red. He was red and it looked good on him. Miraculously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're so mean!" Nakajima exclaimed, covering his red face with his gigantic hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He explained to him what transpired last night - not including how detailed Nakajima - well, that's for him to know. He gets to keep at least that. He told him how he drunkenly barged in and kept him up with 'nonsense' Nakajima first insisted on knowing but gave up after Yuri gave him a withering look. He told him made up tales to fill the space between then ultimately told him how he helped him to his bed for Yuto was close to acquainting himself with the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You could've told me earlier! I really thought - Chinen!" The man groaned once more and this time, Yuri did not shy away from laughing and putting a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You really thought what? That I climbed on your lap?" Yuri teased, laughing loudly when Nakajima whined loudly as well. "That I was on you like a rodeo?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That got him a reaction - Nakajima burying himself on his pillows, saying something unintelligible - or probably he was just saying gibberish. It didn't stop Chinen however from laughing maniacally, joining him on the bed, finally straddling him and really driving a point by pinning him down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He might not look it but he was strong and Nakajima's answering gasp was proof.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And like a switch, it changed the mood.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>As if it was only waiting that moment, everything came crashing down on him: the last few months, the flower waiting for him at home, the thinly veiled casualness they have been keeping up since that conversation they had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nakajima likes him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he likes Nakajima right back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The late realization almost made him want to laugh. How they both managed to last that long without doing anything - not even addressing what's been simmering beneath the surface for the longest time - is absolutely beyond him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're a mad man," Yuri smiled, the hand that was pinning a hand above Yuto's head earlier now gently caressing the cheek of the man who leaned to his touch like he was meant to be doing that. "I wouldn't have lasted half as long waiting on someone."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Call it a full-time job," Nakajima winked and Yuri couldn't really get mad at him for that.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"I won't be anything you expect me to be," Yuri murmured against skin, the taller man pillowed now on his chest as he breathed him in. "You can't show me around - I won't be showing you around,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know," Nakajima smiled, nosing on skin he could reach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I won't even go around telling everyone about us," Chinen said, frowning at himself. "Maybe Yama-chan,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't mind," Yuto said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I won't meddle in any business you have or any antics you come up with - nothing would change between us," Chinen said with a finality, tugging so Nakajima would look up. "But you're mine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a delicate silence between them. Yuri knew that was a little bit too much to ask considering he was willing to give so little. Not to say he lacks experience in relationships but he knows himself better now. It took a lot to get where he is and he's not willing just yet to give it away for a man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if said man is Nakajima Yuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He's been thirsty for him. His attention, his touches - all the subtle ways he could tell himself Nakajima sees him. He has been putting it off for so long that it started to feel like a second skin. So much so that he forgot about it until it surfaced when Yuto confessed -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it still feels surreal and he's been so used to thinking it's a delusion that Yuto could like him back that now that he knew he does - now that he knows he actually likes him back -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn't know what to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he's scared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's all I wanted," Yuto sighed before reaching up to kiss him and remind him that this is real. This giving man just keeps on giving and he's giving this all to him. "I just want to be yours as I want you to be mine," Yuto whispered, his kiss deep and promising and dirty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Even if I can't rub it on everyone's face tomorrow."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Does it really matter? If they know?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That put a pause on the hand that was slowly making its way down where it was moments ago - making him see stars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because I get jealous," Yuto said somber, looking him in the eyes as if finally letting him a peek of that dark side he's so careful not to let anyone get a glimpse of. "And I want people to know they can't touch what's mine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those words sent a sweet tingle up his spine that made him gasp and it was everything Yuto needed, apparently, to make his move and take him high - higher than he did.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing changed the next day, like Yuri said it should be. Yuri got in first and an hour later, Nakajima entered those doors looking every bit like he does every day, smiling politely, excitedly, bouncing to Yamada upon seeing him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only now, when he glanced Yuri's way, there was that shiver he couldn't hold back - all the ways he was owned last night washing him cold and alert.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good morning, Chii," Nakajima greeted him, as if earlier this morning he wasn't devouring him against the wall of his bathroom, making him forget his name for a good few minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nakajima," Yuri nodded politely before turning his attention back to his phone, doing everything he could to ignore the taller man who decided it was okay to sit next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's up?" he asked no nonchalantly that he was almost tempted to just -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nothing much. Just the usual what I should ask Yama-chan to buy me this week," Yuri shrugged and Yuto laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That sneaky hand that squeezed his might've made him smile but it was gone as soon as it came.</span>
