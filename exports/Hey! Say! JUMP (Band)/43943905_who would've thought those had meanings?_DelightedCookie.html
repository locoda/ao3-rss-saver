      <p>
  <span>"What...?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chinen stared baffled at the lone flower held between his thumb and index finger. The flower arrangement came from an anonymous sender congratulating them on the successful concert and contained flowers that represented their member colors - it was really a wonder how they got some blue flowers there considering - yet here was one, in his hand, puzzling him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Everything okay?" Yamada asked, distracting him considering he was already pretty distracted the moment the tallest man in the group gave him the flower and told him it was perfect for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, uh, yeah, I think?" Yuri frowned, looking back at the flower. "I don't really know,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's up?" Yamada asked, intrigued now, also looking at the flower in Yuri's hand, glancing back at the arrangement that the other members were checking out, expressing wonder at the green flowers they managed to get for Yabu. "Yuto's flower?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. He gave it to me earlier. Said it's perfect for me," he shrugged, opting to put the flower next to his things while he cleaned up. "I don't wanna leave it lying around in case I hurt his feelings."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Best not," Yamada agreed, a quick peek at the tallest man telling him he's the most fascinated by the flowers out of everyone. "He might think you hate him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Exactly," he nodded and they left it at that.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The flower came home with Chinen. He placed it in a vase of water despite its poor-looking condition and dismal hope for survival. He knew there was no way it was going to live to see another day but suppose the thought that Yuto gave it to him and said it suited him urged him to hope anyway. And even mildly got him interested in it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Manager-san drove him home, he got busy looking the flower up until he decidedly landed at an app that promised to identify whatever kind of plant or flower he takes a picture of. After several tries - ultimately asking the manager to turn the light on in the car - the app finally successfully identified the flower as a 'cornflower'. He didn't even know those grew in Japan! Or they imported them then in that case - how did they transport them and kept them alive?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anyway, the flower now sat on his coffee table, looking every bit out of place, while he also sat in front of it, busy looking it up and reading information about it - from its varieties to the countries that have decidedly used it to represent something, to how to care for it. Now knowing there was absolutely no hope in keeping it alive in that vase, it sat for show. Soon, he plans to harvest its seeds and plant them anew, planning to see if he could grow it from a seed to an actual plant.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The flower sat withering on his coffee table the following days - or weeks, Chinen too busy to pay it any mind after each long day of working. He was too exhausted to even wash laundry and his only saving grace is the fact that Yamada gives him enough clothes to actually last him two years without having to wash any of them. He's only washing them for hygiene's sake at this point.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, the point stands, he was too busy, too tired, to pay anything else any attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He did have the time when he finally got an entire week of vacation, letting him finally trudge into his living room, the flower completely dried up and brown on that table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I almost forgot about you," Chinen chuckled, picking the thing up, feeling how delicate it was in its wasted state. It felt nothing like the first time he held it. Despite its sorry state, it was still beautiful. It held a sort of dignity - like a promise of a place warmer and brighter and freer. Like a meadow somewhere, overlooking the sea, the breeze enough to kiss his skin and let him know he's alive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, it only looked like several winters has passed it - forgotten in a clearing, meant to be forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But I didn't," Chinen said as if to make up for the previous statement. "I just got busy and didn't have the time. But you're perfect," he told it, smiling as he carefully peeled its dried parts and tried his hardest to discern the seeds from the useless parts. He is basically guessing at this point and hopes for the best but dared not say anything out loud. It felt like Yuto would be sad if he said anything - and the man was not even in the room!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of which, as he carefully broke apart the dried flower, his mind wandered towards the tallest member of the group - none of them predicted that yet here they are - and it made him think about the kind of relationship they've had so far.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They aren't strangers - naturally since they grew up together - but there was something about the air when they are together than seemed like Yuto was very far away. Like he's there but he can't reach him. Chinen could touch him anytime yet he's just - untouchable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They aren't fighting, are they?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that he knows but anyway, he wondered. He wondered why they aren't as close as Nakajima seems to be with Inoo or him with Takaki. He's not even going to use Yamada as an example as their relationship has probably transcended that of any labels known to man. He's just - why aren't they close? Not as close as he realized he would like anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>After following the instructions on the internet and planting the seeds - with the fervor of hope that he actually got the seeds and he planted them right - his mind became occupied with thoughts of Nakajima.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that he's paying attention, their relationship isn't too estranged. If any, there's a respectable distance between them that allowed both of them to observe the other from afar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now that he's paying attention, boy does he notice Nakajima observing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It started with an innocent quip. A simple 'You're glowing' after his much-enjoyed vacation, Chinen grinning easily at the remark and telling him he actually got to sleep a lot of work out in a proper gym. Then it was as if he was collecting pieces of a puzzle, putting together an image he has no clue of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was definitely beyond being casual but lacking enough that he can't call it anything more. Yuto kept his distance and as much as Yuri wanted to bridge that, he felt it unwise to do so. Yuto has a reason for keeping his distance. Yuri will respect that.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He kept on observing; the casual praises, the accidental touches, the lingering looks. Of course, he could shrug them all off and ignore him and choke it all up to overthinking and reading too much into it. It's very easy especially seeing that he's paying Yamada a lot of attention too and the latter is not really doing anything to deter it. If any, it feels almost as if Yamada and Nakajima have an actual substantial thing going on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But can he really shrug it all off and blame it on being overworked that it's almost as if he's seeing things? Like that subtle way Nakajima put a hand on his back and caressed with his thumb - too intimate to ignore, too casual to point out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or that time when the man reached across the table while they ate lunch and obviously caressed his cheek but later nonchalantly shrugged it off as wiping something off his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He's pretty sure he knows where his mouth is and it's nowhere near below his cheekbone as far as a face goes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, baby!" Yuri looked up, smiling when Inoo sat next to him holding his phone, already taking pictures of him. "You okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yep," he smiled, grinning for a picture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You sure? You've been very quiet even Yuya noticed," Inoo said with pursed lips, giving him a meaningful look. Takaki was perceptive but not to a level that he noticed his group mates' silence or pensiveness. It was always with something that was about ready to bite his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I guess - well, I don't know," Yuri decidedly sighed, eyes glancing towards the tallest man in the room crowding Yamada's space and the other man not really doing anything about it. "I guess I've just been thinking a lot lately." he finally said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"About...?" the older man prompted, showing patience.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yuto,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The answer obviously surprised Inoo if his wide eyes were not telling enough. He was probably expecting something that's about work or Yamada. Not Nakajima.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you two okay?" he asked quietly, glancing towards the tall man too, momentarily frowning before his features smoothed over as if nothing happened. "Are you two having a spat?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No!" Yuri exclaimed quietly. "We're - we're actually on very good terms. Surprisingly good," Yuri admitted. He was only met with a hum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't really mind it before because it wasn't really anything," Yuri began, "And of course, I don't want to be presumptive in case I make an absolute fool of myself," he went on, earning a chuckle from his present companion, the two of them exchanging a look, "But Yuto and I - there's a tension."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good tension or bad tension?" Inoo prodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I don't know. It's just tension, I guess," Chinen confessed.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The morning he woke up to some sprouts, he cheered as if he just won something. So he had done it right and got the seeds and now he has something growing in his house. He immediately called Yuto and told him of his progress, forgetting that he has not told anyone about growing anything in the first place so the man's confused support was very understandable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You planted the flower I gave you?" Yuto asked over the line, obviously still trying to keep up if his raspy voice was anything to go by.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I did! It was pretty and I got curious. It was honestly a shot in the dark but I have sprouts!" Chinen cheered, pausing to take a picture and sending it to Yuto. Perhaps he saw it because then he was giving a brighter, more alert cheer, accompanied by an exclamation that sounded more coherent and actually interested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chinen gave himself some time to bask in that - that undivided attention over the phone - before he took a deep breath and steeled himself to ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you want to - I don't know, come over and see it in person?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you sure?" he heard the immediate response and he smiled, realizing that he sounded eager. Like when he's about to be given something and he's excited but he has to tamp it down for the cameras. His voice had the same lilt and that somehow made something in his belly flutter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course. You gave me the flower after all. It'd be a shame if you're not involved in growing it,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew that sounded a little more redolent than it should be but Nakajima's state stopped him from catching on to the more subtle tones and focusing instead on what was at face value.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll be there in a few. Have you had breakfast?"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's amazing!" Nakajima exclaimed, breathing honest interest as he examined the little pot. "You actually grew it!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Too early to really tell but we're starting something," Yuri nodded, taking a bite of the food the taller one brought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After telling him he hadn't had any food - too distracted by the sprouts and his excitement to share it with Nakajima - the other man volunteered to bring him some and they could eat it together. Since Chinen was in a good mood, he teased that if he liked the food Nakajima brings, he'll even let the man name the plant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Too excited at the prospect of naming a plant - probably - Nakajima bought everything he knew Chinen liked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Puru-chan - the plant called by Nakajima - proved determined to grow. Despite being neglected, it grew and grew and each time Nakajima and Chinen got some time alone, they talked about Puru-chan like a little darling they are both keeping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"She's growing up so well," Nakajima smiled at the pictures Chinen took that morning. He watered Puru-chan and took pictures, telling Nakajima she was doing well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're doing a very good job of growing her," he remarked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You've been reading up on her too and helping me a lot although we both neglect her most times," Chinen chuckled, minding the hectic schedule they both keep. "But she's strong."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That she is," Nakajima nodded, a certain look passing his features but was gone before Chinen could even parse it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That's a thing that has been happening lately: Yuto would get a look but it's gone as quickly as it surfaced. Like Yuto was letting him peek at the cracks of the facade he was putting up in front of him. That, or he was cracking unintentionally and Nakajima's doing a bad job of patching it all up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You know you can talk to me, right?" Chinen decided to get out there, thinking it was actually a not-so-bad thing to say since it could seem like he was both concerned for his problems and willing to listen just like any friend. It made him look like he cared enough without appearing too nosy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We're talking," Yuto said, suddenly fidgety. Chinen immediately took pity and reached a hand but before it lasted a second longer, Nakajima was standing up, excusing himself with a reason Chinen did not hear.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>That, sadly, became their trend. It was frustrating, to say the very least. It was as if he was welcome to do anything one moment, then the gates are closing to keep him out the next. Nakajima dangled himself in front of him so freely but once he reached out, it pulled away before he could even touch it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Whatever are you talking about?" Yamada chuckled dryly when Yuri told him his dilemma. "You and Yuto are getting along just fine,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, we're not! It's - I don't know how to explain it and that's even more annoying!" Chinen exclaimed quietly, looking around if anyone was eavesdropping. "I want to connect to him, Yama-chan. I want us to be friends,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You ARE friends," Yamada helpfully pointed, chuckling, out but it only served to irritate the smaller one further, forcing him to walk away to cool down. Yamada will probably make it up to him in some way but not right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Especially now when Nakajima is looking at him as if a deer caught in headlights and the headlights is Chinen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not a good time?" Nakajima asked, the edge on his voice adding to Chinen's frustration. But instead of telling him to go away, he grabbed the man's wrist and pulled him somewhere more private until he was sure there was nobody else to hear them.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are we friends?" Yuri asked the moment he could and he could say it took the man off guard. Yeah, sure it's probably more random than he thought it would be but he doesn't really know what to say and at this point, he also doesn't know what he's feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He has a good hunch Yuto would clear it up, however.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes?" the taller man answered, cautious. "Unless you don't want us to be?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I want that," Yuri nodded, the answer calming him down a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is everything okay?" Yuto asked when no question followed that, only Yuri watching him intensely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Is everything okay? Good bloody question that is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn't know either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He's got an itch he can't scratch because it feels like just when he thinks he'</span>
</p><p>
  <span>s got it, it's in another place, itchier than before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yuri took a deep breath and decided to focus on a very recent point of commonality - the flower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why did you give me that flower?" He asked, eyes closed, not in the mood to look at Nakajima's expressions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because it's perfect for you," Nakajima said as if echoing words only recently said. "I look at that flower and I'm reminded of you," Nakajima said, suddenly softly - so softly that Yuri had to open his eyes to see if he moved away from him and to the other side of the room. He hasn't. He was closer if anything, but quieter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like something would shatter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you know it meant unrequited love?" Chinen decided to reveal when the man stood close enough to hear his quiet voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then it dawned on him - maybe it already has when he read it months ago while researching about the flower that's why he's acting the way he is now - that Yuto harbored these feelings and it took a single flower to -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he was expecting him to do something because he already knows but Yuto kept doing nothing and he was getting impatient -</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Despite all those thoughts, he looked up and decided to think about them all later. He decided to focus on Yuto who was looking at him with gentle eyes and a smile that he finally knew had been hiding so many secrets - just like the feelings he has been keeping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I didn't think you'd even know what it meant," Yuto confessed. "Using flowers to say something has long been forgotten. I was expecting you'd skip that part."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I read how to bloody grow it, Nakajima. Of course, I'd know that too," Chinen said, exasperated, glaring at the taller man who kept his gentle smile and gentle eyes.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn't know where they'd go from there. He finally figured that Nakajima felt something for him and all these years, has been keeping it under a careful mask of indifference, professionalism, and casual friendliness. That man's a bloody good actor and Chinen not figuring this out sooner proved that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to - he wants to return those feelings but honestly? He doesn't know what he's feeling at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chinen felt giddy knowing Yuto had his eyes on him and knowing his feelings - it was flattering and it was making him preen. He wants to return that but he doesn't want to play this lightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Did you also know the flower also means patience?" Nakajima asked him later in the day when he managed to snatch a private time alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yuto, I - "</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not asking you to decide on anything, Chii," Yuto kindly said. "You can decide about nothing at all and I would still be happy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But that's unfair," Yuri frowned. "That's unfair to you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I knew that right from the beginning and I'm still here, aren't I?" Yuto smiled.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The flower grew - and grew some more - and Yuri took great care to never neglect it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It kept him occupied. Sane. And reminded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It reminded him of Yuto. His feelings. It reminded him that with the other man, nothing is ever casual. Accidental. It was only ever made to appear that way so that it may stay beneath the surface undetected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then he decided to bare it out in the open for Chinen to figure out and he did and -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Could it be that he was expecting a different outcome? Perhaps a more favorable one? That's why he -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chinen shook his head. It could be the beginning of the end for men who are ready to leave often say why they came in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And what does he feel about that?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn't know.</span>
