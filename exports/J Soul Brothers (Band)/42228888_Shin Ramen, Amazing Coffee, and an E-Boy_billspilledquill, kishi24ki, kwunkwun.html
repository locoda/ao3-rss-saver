</p><p>Artwork by a03 user <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/billspilledquill/pseuds/billspilledquill" rel="nofollow">billspilledquill</a></p><hr/><p>The moment that the notification of a new video popped up, Omi's mouse cursor flew to it with the same speed of dishing out his whirlwind chain combo in Tekken 7. He was just thankful that he had suppressed his urge to start up another game because he knew that it was about that window during which RILY released his weekly content. How did this shut-in gamer otaku end up obsessed over an unassuming vlogger, one might ask. Omi didn't know himself. The first time he stumbled across the channel after a fateful algorithm on youtube recommendations, something had slowly but steadily began to build up within him, like the dust on his half naked anime girl figurines and gundams.</p><p>For the life of him, Omi couldn't figure out how he ended up getting it so bad for some 30-something year old guy with a moustache and a questionable fashion sense. All the other 500-something comments on the vlogs gushing about how cute and beautiful he was could possibly give him some clues... or not. He adjusted the pink cat-eared headphones and settled back into his gamer chair, tongue darting out to lick over his slightly dry lips in visible nervousness. It felt like so long ago since he's gotten any updates from RILY's life - the guy wasn't all that active on IG nor twitter, save the occasional 'good morning! (with various emojis)' tweet that he'd eyeball for a full minute but not like nor retweet.</p><p>"Hello..." he found himself uttering back in a slightly hoarse voice as RILY cheerfully greeted his viewers, then blushing immediately because he was really such a fucking dumbass, there's no way RILY would be able to hear him. The comments from the other followers were flooding in on the chatroom, and Omi promptly closed it so he could watch his live in peace, thanks very much.</p><p>How could a guy look that adorable eating shin ramen and onigiri? Honestly. The way he kept asking the followers whether it was ok to keep eating and everything... He sipped at his soda slowly, watching RILY slurp down those noodles with relish and then take a big bite of rice ball. Then he was saying something about how work had been kind of tough lately because the weather was getting cold, and he had trouble waking up so early in the morning. Omi tugged the sleeves of his hoodie to hide his fingers - indeed, the temperature was dropping significantly as of late. At times he could hardly be bothered to get out of bed.</p><p>The live was over too quickly for his liking. He couldn't get his brilliant moustache smile or twinkling eyes out of his mind... the pouty shape of his lips... the headphones slipped down as he banged his forehead lightly against his desk. Damn, he was getting horny again over some guy eating instant noodles? What the hell was wrong with him? But that was going to have to wait, because he could hear the lively footsteps of his overbearing housemate coming up the stairs.</p><p>"No, Naoto-san! With all due respect I do not want to play golf with you!" he yelled before he could even get his hand on the door handle. Excuse him for being sexually frustrated (and deranged), but Naoto could kindly shove his golf club up his ass.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As much as Omi was a hopeless e-boy, he was not completely hopeless either. He still contributed to society, in the form of part time work at Tetsuya's cafe and delivery service. He had Naoto to thank for the position, really. Clipping back his overgrown bangs and, having ditched the glasses for contact lenses, he looked a little less like a hikkikomori than before, when he'd spent the entire weekend gaming and making 3D renders of his object of affection.</p><p>"Tosaka-kun! Good morning... yikes, your eye bags are as bad as they were last week," Tetsuya remarked with furrowed brows as he came through the establishment. Omi only made some kind of non-commital noise. At least he bowed at him. He threw on his apron, tying it behind his waist. Unlike Tetsuya-san, he couldn't quite run the strap around twice, because all those years of bad habits had naturally added a couple of inches around his middle. </p><p>Thankfully, he was getting his exercise when delivering the coffee and sandwiches on the bike around the neighbourhood. For the first couple of hours, he helped with preparing ingredients and giving all the dining tables and seats a thorough wipe down. He's gotten a lot better at actually wiping them properly - Tetsuya-san had never been all breathing down his neck about it, but in his own kindly way got him up to speed.</p><p>"Oh, we got a big order for lunch today!" Tetsuya remarked a little later, looking over the details on his phone. "That's always exciting. Tosaka-kun, will you be all right to deliver them all by yourself? They need three platters and two dozen coffees." Omi nodded, much preferring to get out there on the bike rather than having to fake a smile at the lunchtime diners. Thus, after the sandwiches and drinks were prepared, he loaded them all carefully into the box built into the back of the bike and headed off.</p><p>The weather was chilly, bringing goosebumps upon his bare arms as he slowly rode down the streets. His eyes were squinted against the wind, watering from the bite of them. Autumn leaves were rotting upon the asphalt, signifying the ushering in of another season. Just like that, three quarters of the year had already sped by, and he felt like he had hardly achieved anything... apart from getting this job, maybe.</p><p>With a little squeak the bike came to a stop before the establishment. Before him was the structure of a commercial building about 6 levels high. Very bare bones, with most of the steel beams still showing through. Workers were concentrated upon the first and second levels, measuring out plasterboards to go into the frames. So... who should he be talking to to deliver the lunches? Just as he swung his leg off the bike and carefully wheeled it closer to the gate, he heard a familiar laughter. </p><p>But why was it so familiar... it wasn't like he had any friends. His heart had done a bunny hop and he couldn't figure out why. He lifted his head, watching one of the construction workers climb down the open stairs. Still unaware of the lunchboy's arrival, the man's gaze was directed towards his co-worker who had apparently cracked some dumb joke, and his features were lighting up like the sun, or perhaps the entire cosmos, as he laughed another time.</p><p>"Oh shit, can you go grab the food? My wife is calling -"</p><p>"Ken-chan, you shouldn't even have your personal phone on your when you're working."</p><p>"It's my work phone..."</p><p>"That's even worse!"</p><p>That melodic laughter rung again, before the man disappeared from view. Omi turned away from that partition wall where the boards had already been put up, and towards the right where the man had headed out. His ribs were literally squeezing his heart as he stood there like a Jizo statue, waiting for him to come and receive him.</p><p>Like some kind of really niche shampoo commercial or forgotten episode of Baywatch, the man was trotting towards him seemingly in slow motion, giving his sweat-dampened blond locks a soft shake to free them from the shape of the helmet that he had been wearing for hours. His uniform had been unbuttoned half way down his chest, his tan skin and the shape of his pects tantalizingly half-visble through through the sweat dampened white t-shirt beneath.</p><p>"Hello!"</p><p>By the way, wasn't there something 'uwu' about the way RILY smiled? Except it wasn't RILY, but the man behind the channel, himself. In person. Not even a meter away from him. Omi's legs felt like konnyaku and his features were frozen in a mixture of fear, bliss, and excitement.</p><p>"Um... are you ok? You're from... Amazing Coffee, right?" RILY's head tilted as he leaned in slightly with concern creasing his beautiful brows. </p><p>"Y-yes... th-the, the delivery..." He couldn't be blamed for sounding like a clown, because he didn't speak that much to begin with, and RILY was way too close. His eyes glanced down to the tag on his work uniform - which said Imaichi. Suddenly, his chest was flaring with some kind of jealous satisfaction, like he knew something about RILY that none of his other followers would.</p><p>He hoped the trembling of his fingers were hidden from RILY as he unlocked the box to bring out the delivery. "Um, it's, it's a lot so... I can help with carrying them in," he offered, his voice low and embarrassed.</p><p>"That would be a great help, thank you!" RILY smiled broadly at him as he reached out to grab a few of those boxes, and Omi almost died when their fingers brushed in the process. The next minute or so went way too fast, his brain experiencing a full melt down as he tried to take everything into the deepest part of his memory. The shape of his shoulders and his waist, his hips, the view of his slim neck from the back...</p><p>"Thank you for delivering the order! It smells great," RILY told him gratefully after they had set all of the boxes on the makeshift dining table. </p><p>"Y-you're welcome..."</p><p>Surely this couldn't be it... fate had led him to the man himself, and was that all he had to say to him? Was this encounter going to be over just like that? The more he entangled himself in his inner turmoil, the more RILY's friendly smile faltered in confusion.</p><p>"Your... your ch..."</p><p>"Um, yes?"</p><p>"Your channel!"</p><p>His outburst ended with a truly desperate expression upon his face, while RILY's went from incomprehension to abashed realisation. Ah, the man was blushing. And how fucking beautiful he looked with his skin tinged with pink, the shade making the dusting of moles upon the left cheekbone shine out even more.</p><p>"Sh..."</p><p>RILY held up a finger to his lips, his eyes slightly winked as a little giggle escaped from his mouth. Now it would be truly humiliating if he got a boner in broad daylight right before him. "My co-workers don't know."</p><p>"It really isn't much of a channel, but -</p><p>"Not at all! I - I find it super entertaining!"</p><p>"Oh? Th-thank you..." RILY touched his surprisingly slim fingers to his nose in embarrassment. "I'm glad that you enjoy it that much. Would you mind if... you told me your name?"</p><p>"It's O- I mean, it's Fred..." that was his online handle... but oh, what the hell. "You can call me Omi..."</p><p>RILY chuckled once more, putting his hands to the top of his thighs before lowering his head in a bow. "Omi-san, thank you for watching my channel."</p><p>Gazing at the top of RILY's head, unicorns fluttering all around his stomach, Omi hoped against hope that this building would take a bit longer to complete; that these workers would crave sandwiches and coffee for lunch more often.</p><p> </p><p>tbc</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>当新视频的通知弹出的那一刻，Omi的鼠标光标飞向了它，就像在《铁拳7》中施展旋风连击的速度一样。他只是庆幸自己抑制住了启动另一个游戏的冲动，因为他知道，这是在RILY发布其每周内容的那个窗口。有人可能会问，这个闭门造车的玩家御宅族怎么会迷恋上一个不起眼的博客作者。Omi自己也不知道。他第一次偶然发现这个频道是因为youtube一个决定性的算法推荐所致。 从那时起, 有些东西已经缓慢但稳定地开始在他体内积累，比喻他半裸的动漫女孩小雕像和高达在架子上堆灰尘。</p><p>Omi一辈子都想不明白，他怎么会被一个留着小胡子、时尚感有问题的30多岁的家伙搞得这么惨。所有其他500多条关于他是多么可爱和美丽的博客评论可能会给他一些线索......或者没有。他调整了粉红色的猫耳式耳机，坐回到他的游戏椅上，舌头伸出来舔了舔他那略显干燥的嘴唇，明显感到紧张。他感觉已经很久没有收到RILY的任何生活更新了--这家伙在IG和twitter上都不太活跃，除了偶尔的 "早上好！(有各种表情符号) "的推特，他看了整整一分钟，但不会like也不转发。</p><p>"你好...... "当RILY欢快地问候他的观众时，他发现自己用略带沙哑的声音回了一句，然后马上脸红了，因为他真的是个该死的笨蛋，RILY不可能听到他的话。其他追随者的评论纷纷涌向聊天室，Omi迅速关闭了，这样他就可以安静地观看他的直播了。</p><p>一个人吃拉面和饭团的样子怎么会那么可爱？说实话。他不停地问追随者是否可以继续吃...... 他慢慢地喝着汽水，看着RILY津津有味地啜饮着那些面条，然后大口大口地吃着饭团。然后他在说，最近的工作有点难，因为天气越来越冷，他很难在早上这么早起床。Omi扯了扯连帽衫的袖子，遮住了自己的手指--的确，最近气温明显下降了。有时，他几乎懒得下床。</p><p>对他来说，直播结束得太快了。他无法忘记他那灿烂的胡子笑容或闪烁的眼睛......他嘴唇的形状......当他用额头轻轻撞着桌子时，耳机开始滑落下来。该死的，他又因为某个吃方便面的家伙而变得饥渴了？他到底是怎么了？但这要等一等，因为他能听到他那盛气凌人的室友上楼的热闹脚步声。</p><p>"不，直人先生! 恕我直言，我不想和你打高尔夫！"他甚至还没来得及把手放在门把手上就大喊起来。原谅他在性方面的挫折（和精神错乱），但直人可以好心地把他的高尔夫球杆塞进他的屁股。</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>尽管Omi是一个无望的电子男孩，但他也不是完全无望。他仍然为社会做出了贡献，在Tetsuya的咖啡馆做兼职，并提供送货服务。他要感谢直人为他安排了这个职位，真的。他把过长的刘海向后夹好，并把眼镜换成了隐形眼镜，看起来不像以前把整个周末都花在游戏和制作他的爱慕对象的3D渲染图上的宅男。</p><p>"登坂君! 早上好......哎呀，你的眼袋和上周一样严重了，"Tetsuya皱着眉头说。Omi只发出了某种漠不关心的声音。至少他向他鞠了一躬。他系上围裙，把它系在腰后。与Tetsuya先生不同，他不能完全把带子绕两圈，因为这些年的坏习惯自然而然地在他的中间增加了几英寸。 </p><p>值得庆幸的是，他骑着自行车在附近送咖啡和三明治的时候得到了锻炼。在最初的几个小时里，他帮助准备食材，并把所有的餐桌和座位都彻底擦拭干净。在实际擦拭方面，他已经做得很好了--Tetsuya先生从来没有在这方面对他指手画脚，但他以自己善意的方式让他加快了进度。</p><p>"哦，我们今天的午餐有一个大订单！" 过了一会儿Tetsuya说，并看了看手机上的细节。"这总是令人兴奋的。登坂君，你一个人去送可以吗？他们需要三个拼盘和两打咖啡。" Omi点了点头，他更喜欢骑着自行车出去，而不是对着午餐时间的食客假笑。因此，在准备好三明治和饮料后，他把它们都小心翼翼地装进自行车后面内置的箱子里，然后出发了。</p><p>天气很冷，当他在街道上慢慢骑行时，裸露的手臂上出现了鸡皮疙瘩。他的眼睛被风吹得眯成了一条缝，吹得水汪汪的。秋天的树叶在柏油路上腐烂，标志着另一个季节的到来。就这样，一年的四分之三已经过去了，他觉得自己几乎没有什么成就......除了得到这份工作之外，也许。</p><p>随着一声轻微的吱吱声，自行车在机构前停了下来。在他面前的是一个大约6层高的商业建筑结构。非常简陋，大部分的钢梁还露在外面。工人们正集中在第一层和第二层，测量石膏板以装入框架。那么......他应该找谁来送午餐？就在他把腿从自行车上抡下来，小心翼翼地把它推近大门的时候，他听到了一阵熟悉的笑声。 </p><p>但为什么这么熟悉呢......他又没有什么朋友。他的心做了一个兔子跳，他想不明白为什么。他抬起头，看着其中一个建筑工人爬下敞开的楼梯。那人仍然没有意识到午餐男孩的到来，他的目光投向他显然开了一些愚蠢的玩笑的同事。他又笑了起来的时候，五官像太阳一样亮了起来，或许是整个宇宙。</p><p>"哦，妈的，你能不能去拿点吃的？我老婆在打电话--"</p><p>"健酱，你工作的时候不应该带着你的私人电话。"</p><p>"这是我的工作电话..."</p><p>"那就更糟糕了！"</p><p>那悠扬的笑声再次响起，然后那人从视野中消失了。Omi转过身去，离开那面已经搭好木板的隔墙，朝那人出去的右边走去。他的肋骨简直是在挤压他的心脏，他像一尊地藏菩萨一样站在那里，等待着他来接待他。</p><p>就像某种非常小众的洗发水广告或被遗忘的 《守望先锋》剧集一样，那人似乎是以慢动作向他走来，轻轻摇晃他被汗水浸湿的金发，让它从他已经戴了几个小时的头盔形状中解放出来。他的制服已经解开了胸前的一半，他黝黑的皮肤和他的胸脯的形状透过汗水浸湿的白色T恤衫诱人地半露在外面。</p><p>"你好！"</p><p>顺便说一句，RILY笑起来的样子是不是有点 uwu？只是那不是RILY，而是这个频道背后的人自己。亲临现场。离他甚至不到一米远。Omi的双腿感觉像大菜糕，五官在恐惧、幸福和兴奋的混合中凝固。</p><p>"嗯......你还好吗？ 你是来自......Amazing Coffee，对吗？" RILY的头歪了歪，他微微靠过来，美丽的眉毛上皱起了忧虑。 </p><p>"是......是......送......送货......" 不能责怪他听起来像个小丑，因为他本来就不怎么说话，而RILY离得太近了。他的眼睛瞥了一眼工作服上的标签--上面写着今市。突然间，他的胸口涌现出某种嫉妒的满足感，好像他知道一些关于RILY的事情，而他的其他追随者都不会知道。</p><p>他希望当他打开箱子把快递拿出来时，他手指的颤抖能瞒过RILY。"嗯，这，这有很多，所以......我可以帮忙把它们搬进去"　他提出，声音又低又尴尬。</p><p>"那个帮大忙，谢谢你！" RILY对他宽慰地笑了笑，伸手去抓其中的几个箱子。当他们的手指在这个过程中擦肩而过时，Omi差点死掉。接下来的一分钟左右走得太快了，他的大脑经历了一次全面的融化，因为他试图把所有的东西都带入他记忆的最深处。他的肩膀和腰部的形状，他的臀部，从后面看他纤细的脖子......</p><p>"谢谢你送来的订单! 它闻起来很香。" 在他们把所有的箱子放在临时餐桌上后，RILY感激地告诉他。 </p><p>"不客气......"</p><p>当然，事不可能就这样结束......命运把他引向了这个人，而这就是他要对他说的全部吗？这次相遇就这样结一段落吗？他越是把自己纠缠在内心的动荡中，RILY友好的微笑就越是在困惑中摇摆不定。</p><p>"你的......你的Ch......"</p><p>"嗯？"</p><p>"你的频道！"</p><p>他的爆发以他脸上真正绝望的表情结束，而RILY的表情则从迷乱变成了尴尬的理解。啊，他脸红了。皮肤染上了粉红色，看起来真他妈的漂亮.......这种色调使左颧骨上的黑痣更加耀眼。</p><p>"嘘......"</p><p>RILY举起一根手指放在嘴唇上，他的眼睛微微眨动着，嘴里发出一声轻笑。现在，如果他在光天化日之下在他面前勃起，那才是真正的耻辱。"我的同事们不知道。"</p><p>"这确实不是什么了不起的频道，但是------"。</p><p>"一点也不会！我--我觉得它超级有趣。觉得它超有娱乐性！"</p><p>"哦，这--谢谢你......" RILY尴尬地用他那出奇纤细的手指摸了摸鼻子。"我很高兴你这么喜欢它。你是否介意......告诉我你的名字？"</p><p>"是奥--我是说，是Fred...... "那是他的网名......但哦，管它呢。"你可以叫我Omi......"</p><p>RILY再次笑着说，把他的手放在大腿上面，然后低头鞠躬。"Omi先生，谢谢你观看我的频道。"</p><p>凝视着RILY的头顶，独角兽在他的肚子上四处飞舞，Omi抱紧希望这栋楼能多花点时间完工；希望这些工人能更经常地渴望三明治和咖啡作为午餐。</p><p> </p><p>tbc</p>

It had certainly grown a lot over the past few months; there was about a whole inch of growth at the roots, signifying that he was due for a bleach retouch soon. He hummed a tune while walking downstairs to the lounge, where the sound of fingers flying across a gaming keyboard could clearly be heard.</p><p>Tsurugi was the son of a friend of his, but they were close enough that he treated him like his own nephew. The younger man had just found a job here in the city, and was staying there for the next couple of months till he found himself another apartment. Ryuji told him that there was no rush, since he enjoyed his company. </p><p>"The shower's free if you want it!" he offered, heading over to the fridge to grab a cold beer. Tsurugi grunted back, finishing off this tournament before he sat back heavily against the chair. A puff of air escaped from his lips before he plucked off the headphones.</p><p>"Thanks, Ryuji-san!“ he tossed a smile over his shoulder, then stretched up his arms to loosen some of those stiff muscles. Ryuji had never gotten into the whole gaming thing, even if Tsurugi was kind enough to explain it all to him. As he leaned over and enjoyed his beer, the younger man gave him a little overview of what he'd been up to on the game. It was just a nice thing he did to make him feel included even if he had no idea how to play.</p><p>”And this healer we got on our team this last round, man? Oh man, she really sucked so bad," Tsurugi was saying, cackling over the conversation that was still going energetically in the corner of the screen. "She's cute though."</p><p>"Cute?" Ryuji raised his brows. "You mean you saw her photo or something?"</p><p>"Oh, nah... we just write in the chat. You see. The way she talks is really cute."</p><p>Ryuji leaned in a little further, following Tsurugi's cursor to the name of the user that was still responding to various messages. 'Fred'? Now where had he heard that name before...</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p><br/><em>Tsurimi</em><br/>I gtg shower! Will probs watch something after that</p><p><em>Fred</em><br/>Bb Tsurimi~ go scrub up that stinky body</p><p><em>Bakahiro</em><br/>Fred-chan is always so cold~~~</p><p><em>Gaogao</em><br/>So chilly~~~</p><p><em>Fred</em><br/>It's a term of endearment &lt;3</p><p><em>Tsurimi</em><br/>Bye everyone!! Bye Fred</p><p><em>Bakahiro</em><br/>What about me!!</p><p><em>Gaogao</em><br/>Lol jealousy</p><p><em>Tsurimi</em><br/>Bye Bakahiro!</p><p><em>Fred</em><br/>Stinky &lt;3</p><p>It was Omi's turn to stretch out his body after that round of gaming; he'd been at it for four hours without a break, and honestly his bladder was starting to make complaints. These dumbass guys... they were way too flirty. Gross! But didn't that make him, the one flirting back with a girl avatar, also gross? He set down his cat earphone with a sassy curl of the lips before giving the bathroom a quick visit. </p><p>"Omi-chan, stop flirting with strangers all the time," Naoto called out to him as he emerged from the bathroom. "Did you wash your hands with soap, stinky?"</p><p>"Shut up..." He could still not believe that Naoto-san was playing the same game as him and interacting on the chat. If he ever threatened to blow his cover that he was just another guy, he might really throttle the guy. "I'm doing all the single gamer nerds a favour by giving them hope."</p><p>"That's a bit ironic coming from you..." Naoto turned in his seat to grin at him. "I happen to have a date this weekend. Not that you'd ever understand what that's like. And I don't mean dating simulators!"</p><p>"Don't get cocky just cos you have a date!" he scowled, throwing up his hoodie. "I'm going out to grab dinner. You want anything?" As annoying as Naoto was, he was still the one paying more rent and got him a job.</p><p>"Mmm... Chicken katsu-don. Thanks Fred-chan, always so sweet~"</p><p>"Keep talking trash and I'm just gonna get you plain onigiri."</p><p>He had picked up some better habits thanks to working part time, such as taking a walk to the convenience store to get food every now and then, rather than digging out the cup noodles from the back of the cupboard. Especially after he's met RILY in person, a man with the physique of the gods themselves... well, it wasn't like he had any hope of ever impressing him. Not with the perpetual panda-eyes, grimy hair, crooked back and pudgy stomach... but his face could pass as cute right? Right?! With a little bit of concealer and some nice clothes...?</p><p>That fantasy was brought to an abrupt halt once the doors to 7/11 opened and the clerk gave him a look as though she though he'd crawled right out of the sewers. She did bow and greet him cheerfully, but he could tell when people judged him. He wouldn't blame them, because he hadn't washed his hair since three days ago and his eyes were bloodshot as hell.</p><p>As he slowly looked through the bentos on display, his mind was mostly on RILY, or Imaichi, as his name tag had revealed. He hadn't seen him again after that first encounter, as much as he hoped that Tetsuya-san would receive another order while he was on shift. It wouldn't be all that surprising if Imaichi had forgotten about him already. The way he tried to speak to him had been borderline creepy and all.</p><p>And let's not talk about how many times he's already wanked to the thought of him, the shimmer of sweat upon his forehead, the delicate shape of his neck... that brilliant smile, the slim little waist and long legs... how could he be that fucking gorgeous, excuse me? Omi dropped the bentos into his basket and moved on to the next fridge. Imagine, RILY coming to this very store to take his pick of the next food to trial on his vlogs? His slim fingers taking hold of this bottle of CC Lemon and putting it back again to reach for the oolong tea instead, and then repeat a couple more times till he ended up buying both?</p><p>The notion of him getting it so bad for the guy was honestly frightening. Omi did his best to avoid eye contact with the cashier as he made payment. Of course, he was planning to watch one of the old vlogs as he ate himself, so that it could taste more delicious with his company (Naoto-san was obviously not a part of this equation).</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Welcome to another episode of RILY's room! How's everyone doing today?" Ryuji had more or less gotten used to smiling normally in front of the camera when he couldn't see anybody elses' faces. At least, they were quite energetic in the chatroom. Most of those comments were hello's with lots of emoji's or compliments that were enough to make him blush slightly. With Tsurugi-kun's help, he was able to create the channel and get it up and running; the younger man was responsible for helping him get the viewers to flood in as well. How exactly, he didn't know. Young people just had that kind of capability, he guessed.</p><p>This time he was reviewing a series of snacks and ice cream. That he was quite excited about, because they were Chinese brands that purported to taste like the famous white rabbit candy, another like pearl milk tea. The frozen treats sat in an ice bucket in the meanwhile as he started with the cookies, reading out each of the packets and explaining the ingredients. He originally had no idea why people would be so interested in something this trivial, but apparently, young women found it healing to watch that kind of thing.</p><p>He still made an effort to ask them all sorts of questions, offering to listen to any troubles or concerns between bites of whatever food he was reviewing. Some people certainly seemed to come for that, finding a kind of refuge in being able to vent their worries to a complete stranger under the protection of anonymity. He chewed on the cream cookie and wiped a crumb off his moustache, leaning slightly closer to read some of the comments bouncing off on the screen.</p><p>"Have you ever accidentally mixed up someone's laundry with yours... like underwear?!" Ryuji moved back with eyes widened, and he rocked back in his chair in embarrassed laughter. Sometimes, he did get questions like that out of the blue. "Maybe I got a white t-shirt mixed up, but not really underwear... what about you, N-san?"</p><p>"Oh! Your boyfriend wore your underwear because he ran out? That's... that's pretty surprising..." The comments were blowing up at that juncture, making him quite amused. That's one of the side effects of running a live stream late in the night, he supposed. "Would it be rude to ask what colour it was? Oh, black? With... with lace! Oh... but how... um, wouldn't it be a bit too tight?"</p><p>He paused to open up the first ice block, with no consideration of whether it might be slightly inappropriate given the current topic. "Not tight?" Ryuji couldn't help the low giggles as he peeled away the package to reveal the milk candy flavoured ice block. "Oh, here is the white rabbit candy ice cream! Hmm, let's have a try of this..."</p><p>The topic of underwear was still going strong as he gave the ice block an experimental lick. "Oh wow! It really tastes just like the candy! The flavour is so rich... it's not icy at all, kind of thick and sticky... anyway..." Parting his lips he sucked upon the top of it, humming softly at the pleasing texture. "That makes me so curious, to be honest. I feel like I might fit those? I kind of want to try that now." He laughed again, half hiding his mouth behind the back of his knuckles. "Sorry, sorry, Let's keep the topic more sensible now, it was my fault."</p><p>A little while later, the pop up of a username suddenly gave him pause. Fred. It was Fred, again! What was it, this Fred? "My hair? Fred-san, you think I should cut my hair?" He hummed amusedly as he turned his head a little to the side, running his fingers through the small ponytail he had tied at the back. "Maybe you're right. I was planning to bleach my roots soon as well. I'll cut and dye it at the same time!" Strangely, Fred didn't respond to that; other commentators taking over on the topic of hairstyles.</p><p>While the name would haunt him for about 20 minutes after he finished the livestream, his own footage of eating an ice block while chatting about wearing women's underwear would haunt poor Fred for the rest of the night, plus the day after.</p><p> </p><p>tbc.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>隆二跳出浴室，用毛巾擦拭着湿漉漉的发丝。在过去的几个月里，他的头发确实长了不少；发根处大约长了整整一英寸，这说明他很快就该去漂白了。他一边哼着小曲，一边走到楼下的休息室，那里可以清楚地听到手指在游戏键盘上飞行的声音。</p><p>剣是他一个朋友的儿子，但他们关系很好，几乎把他当做自己的侄子。这个年轻人刚刚在这个城市找到了一份工作，接下来的几个月他将住在那里，直到他找到另一套公寓。隆二告诉他，不用着急，因为他喜欢他的陪伴。</p><p>"淋浴室可以用啦！"他提出，走到冰箱前拿了一瓶冰啤酒。剣哼了一声，结束了这场比赛后，重重地往椅子后靠。在他摘下耳机时，从嘴唇里吐出了一口气。</p><p>"谢谢你，隆二先生！"他抛出一个微笑，然后伸起手臂，松开一些僵硬的肌肉。隆二从未接触过游戏这回事，即使剣好心向他解释这一切。当他俯身享受啤酒时，剣向他介绍了在游戏中的一些情况。即使他不知道如何玩，这是他一向都会做的事，让他觉得自己被包括在内。</p><p>"上一轮我们队里的这个负责治疗的伙计呢，哦，她真的玩的太差劲了," 剣说。看到在屏幕一角仍在热烈进行的对话中，他笑了起来。"不过她很可爱。"</p><p>"可爱？" 隆二扬起了眉毛。"你是说你看过她的照片还是什么？"</p><p>"哦，不......我们只是在聊天中写的。你看。她说话的方式真的很可爱。"</p><p>隆二又往前靠了靠，顺着剣的光标看向那个还在回复各种信息的用户的名字。'Fred'？他从哪里听过这个名字......</p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>Tsurimi<br/>我去洗澡了! 之后可能会去看电影</p><p>Fred<br/>Bb Tsurimi~去擦洗一下那臭烘烘的身体。</p><p>Gaogao<br/>Fred总是那么冷酷~~~~</p><p>Bakahiro<br/>好冷啊~~~~</p><p>Fred<br/>这是一个爱称 &lt;3</p><p>Tsurimi<br/>大家再见! 拜拜，Fred醬</p><p>Bakahiro<br/>那我呢！？</p><p>Gaogao<br/>羡慕嫉妒恨啊hh</p><p>Tsurimi<br/>再见，Bakahiro！</p><p>Fred<br/>臭味相投&lt;3</p><p>在那一轮游戏之后，轮到Omi伸展他的身体了；他已经连续四个小时没有休息了，说实话，他的膀胱已经开始抱怨。这些愚蠢的家伙......他们太轻浮了。真恶心。 但这不是让他这个用女孩头像调情的人也很恶心吗？他放下他的猫咪耳机，潇洒地翘起嘴角，然后快速地去了趟洗手间。</p><p>"Omi，别老是和陌生人调情，" 当他从浴室出来时，直人叫住了他。"你用肥皂洗了手吗，臭小子？"</p><p>"闭嘴......" 他仍然无法相信直人先生和他玩同样的游戏，在聊天中进行互动。如果有一天他威胁要揭穿他的身份，说他是男人，他可能真的会扼杀这个人。"我是在帮所有单身玩家书呆子的忙，给他们带来希望。"</p><p>"这话从你嘴里说出来有点讽刺......" 直人在他的座位上转过身来对他咧嘴笑。"我这个周末刚好有一个约会。不是说你会明白那是什么感觉。而且我不是指约会模拟器！"</p><p>"不要因为你有个约会就狂妄自大！"他皱起眉头，扔起了他的连帽衫。"我要出去买饭吃。你想要什么吗？" 尽管直人很烦人，但他仍然是那个支付更多租金并为他找到工作的人。</p><p>"嗯... 鸡扒饭。谢谢你，Omi，总是那么可爱~"</p><p>"继续说垃圾话，我就给你买普通的饭团。"</p><p>由于兼职工作，他已经养成了一些较好的习惯，比如时不时地去便利店买点东西，而不是从橱柜后面挖出杯面。特别是在他见到RILY本人之后，这个拥有众神之躯的男人......好吧，他不像是有任何希望能给他留下印象。他的熊猫眼、脏兮兮的头发、弯曲的背和肥胖的肚子......但他的脸还算可爱，对吗？对吧！？用一点遮瑕膏和一些漂亮的衣服...？</p><p>当7/11的门打开时，这种幻想就戛然而止了，店员看了他一眼，好像她认为他是从下水道里爬出来的。她确实向他鞠了一躬，并愉快地打招呼，但他能看出人们对他的评价。他不会责怪他们，因为他从三天前开始就没有洗过头，而且他的眼睛也充血得厉害。</p><p>当他慢慢地看完展示的饭盒时，他的心思主要在RILY身上，或者说是今市，正如他的名字标签所显示的那样。第一次见面后，他没有再见到他，尽管他希望Tetsuya先生在他值班时能接到另一份订单。如果今市已经忘记了他，这并不令人惊讶。他上次试图和他说话的方式已经足到令人毛骨悚然。</p><p>他想着他打了多少次手枪也不用多说。他额头上的汗水的光泽，他脖子的精致形状......那灿烂的笑容，纤细的小腰和长腿......他怎么可能那么他妈的华丽，对不起？Omi把馒头放进篮子里，然后转到下一个冰箱里。想象一下，RILY来到这家商店，在他的视频博客上挑选下一个要试用的食物？他纤细的手指拿起这瓶CC柠檬，又放回原处，转而去拿乌龙茶，然后再重复几次，直到他最后干脆两样都买下？</p><p>说实话，他对这个家伙如此痴迷是挺可怕的。Omi在付款时尽力避免与收银员的目光接触。当然，他打算在自己吃的时候看一个旧的视频博客，这样在他的陪伴下可以吃得更美味（直人先生显然不在这个等式中）。</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"欢迎来到RILY‘s Room的新一集! 大家今天好吗？" 隆二或多或少已经习惯了在镜头前即使看不到其他人的脸都可以正常微笑。至少，他们在聊天室里是很有活力的。这些评论大多是带有大量表情符号的问候，或者是足以让他微微脸红的赞美。在剣君的帮助下，他建立了这个频道；这个年轻人也负责帮助他让观众涌入更多观众。具体怎么做的，他也不知道。年轻人就是有这种能力，他猜测。</p><p>这一次，他正在评论一系列的小吃和冰淇淋。他对此相当兴奋，因为它们是中国品牌，据称味道像著名的大白兔糖，另一个像珍珠奶茶。这些冷冻食品同时放在一个冰桶里，他从饼干开始，逐一宣读包装，解释成分。他原本不知道为什么人们会对这种小事如此感兴趣，但显然，年轻女性觉得看这种东西很有吸引力。</p><p>他仍然努力向他们提出各种问题，在咬了一口他正在评论的食物之间，主动倾听她们的任何麻烦或担忧。有些人似乎就是为了这个而来，在匿名的保护下向一个完全陌生的人发泄她们的忧虑，找到了一种庇护。他咀嚼着奶油饼干，擦掉胡子上的碎屑，稍稍靠近，阅读屏幕上弹出的一些评论。</p><p>"你有没有经验过不小心把别人的衣服和你的混在一起......比如内衣？" 隆二睁大眼睛，尴尬地笑着摇回椅子上。有时，他确实会突然收到这样的问题。"也许我不时会把室友的白T恤搞混了，但不是内衣......你呢，N小姐？"</p><p>"哦！你的男朋友因为内裤没洗而穿了你的三角裤？这......这可真让人吃惊......" 评论在这个时候炸开了，让他颇感好笑。这就是在深夜进行直播的一个结果，他想。"如果问它是什么颜色，会不会很不礼貌？哦，黑色？有......有花边！？哦......但是怎么......嗯，会不会有点太紧？"</p><p>他停顿了一下，打开了第一个冰块，没有考虑到在当前的话题下是否可能略显不妥。"不紧吗？" 当他剥开包装，露出牛奶糖味的冰块时，隆二忍不住低声傻笑起来。"哦，这就是大白兔糖果冰淇淋! 嗯，让我们尝尝这个......"</p><p>当他试验性地舔了一下冰块时，关于内衣的话题仍在继续。"哦，哇！它的味道真的和糖果一样! 味道是如此丰富......它一点也不冰，有点厚和粘......总之......" 分开嘴唇，他吮吸着它的顶部，对那令人愉悦的质地轻声哼唱。"说实话，这让我很好奇。我觉得我可能穿得上？我现在有点想试试了。" 他又笑了起来，把嘴半掩在指关节后面。"对不起，对不起，我们现在让话题更理智些吧，是我的错。"</p><p>过了一会儿，一个用户名的弹出突然让他暂停了。Fred。是Fred，又是Fred! 是什么，这个Fred？"我的头发？Fred先生，你认为我应该剪短我的头发？" 他一边好笑地哼着，一边把头稍稍转向一边，用手指捋着他在后面扎的小马尾。"也许你是对的。我打算很快也要漂白根部。就同时剪和染吧！" 奇怪的是，Fred没有对此作出回应；其他评论员接过了关于发型的话题。</p><p>这个名字会在他结束直播后困扰他大约20分钟。相比起来，他自己一边吃着冰块一边聊着穿女性内衣的镜头会在剩下的时间里困扰着可怜的Fred。</p><p> </p><p>tbc.</p>

</p><p>Art by <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/billspilledquill/pseuds/billspilledquill" rel="nofollow">billspilledquill</a></p><hr/><p>The dream had been going well at the start. His angel RILY had his hair cropped shorter to reveal that elegant line of his neck. Has he ever seen another man with such a gorgeous, slim neck? The white shirt he wore was slowly slipping over his back, displaying the fine shape of his shoulder and perfectly toned back muscles. Soft light flowing in from the window made the shirt slightly see through. The ambiguity between being able to see and not being able to see could make anyone's mouths go dry.</p><p>RILY was slowly turning to him, that slow twist of his crazily slim waist making his heart do samuersaults. That 45 degree angle tilt of his head, that sweet gaze... Omi felt like his whole body might melt into a puddle. But just as he tried to pry his ass off the seat and reach out for him, someone else rudely bumped past him. An all-too familiar face. That annoying handsome guy who kept showing off his selfies in the group chat.</p><p>Bakahiro sauntered over to RILY, stealing the man's attention with his big round eyes and dimpled smile. Or maybe, that attention didn't belong to him from the beginning... Bakahiro's palm brushed along RILY's cheek, fingers tracing the shell of his ear, and then sweeping into the soft blond strands of his hair. NOOOOOOOOO!! Omi wanted to key smash his great complaints, but he couldn't do anything but sit there and eyeball the scene with his arms crossed tight over his chest. </p><p>Closer... he was getting closer... RILY, why did he have to look so sated and beautiful as Bakahiro swooped in to steal those moustache lips that were meant for HIM and HIM alone? Fuck that guy! He-</p><p>Omi awoke with a boner and with his body drenched in sweat. Had he ate something funny to make his wet dream turn into such a nightmare? It may also be caused by tiredness. Lately, he'd been trying to get into an exercise routine... if he didn't improve himself, how the hell could he hope to impress RILY? There was actually good incentive for this. Last week, Tetsuya-san told him in a kind of off-hand manner that the construction company they had delivered to the other time had signed a contract with them to renovate the cafe. It was a long overdue renovation, one that Tetsuya had been carefully planning for quite some time with his long-term romantic and business partner. They'd finally raised enough funds for it, and with Omi employed there as well, he could also give them a hand and make the process that much faster.</p><p>Thus the new face washes, face masks, diet, the jogging... Omi wanted the second meeting with Imaichi-san to be good enough to smash through that poor first impression. Hopefully he'd be wowed by this handsome cafe worker before him? Maybe he could even get his number? Um, was he an actual idiot? At any rate, he picked the best slimming t-shirt and jeans he could find that day, and nervously headed off to work.</p><p>"You're early today, Tosaka-kun. Looking better day by day... that's so nice to see!" Tetsuya greeted him with a bright smile. He was also wearing t-shirt and jeans today rather than a shirt, since he'd also be taking part in some of the demolition process. "The construction crew are on their way. I've already brewed the coffee so that we could just go over the plans together before we start... could you help with the sandwiches too? There's only a few left." Omi agreed immediately, thinking that he'd prepare the best fucking sandwiches ever in his life.</p><p>A while later, they finally come through. Omi and Tetsuya hurried over to the entrance, greeting each of them with bows. Ah... there he was. Imaichi-san, he had really... oh, he had really cut his hair! Just like he had randomly and maybe creepily suggested in the livestream... fuck, he looked so good?! The man seemed to have caught his lingering gaze, and after a slight, quizzical tilt of the head, granted him another one of those brilliant smiles. They all exchanged some self introductions before Tetsuya-san ushered everyone over to a big table to sit and dine.</p><p>It couldn't have been a more wonderful day. Some parts of it was hard; he was sweating all over and losing his breath from carrying things in and out of the van. Even if Imaichi-san looked so petite, he had the strength of a bull. Just when he thought he couldn't fall for him any deeper. Of course, none of this showed on Omi's resting bitch face apart from the occassional flush on the cheeks. There was some time in between where he had a window of opportunity to start a conversation with him.</p><p>Omi could chat online but in real life, in front of his crush? That was pretty advanced.</p><p>However, asking the man about the videos he posted and the food he particularly enjoyed proved to be a successful strategy. Imaichi-san was happy to tell him all about what he found most delicious and how he happened to come across some of those restaurants. He also found out that the man enjoyed 90s R&amp;B music and did a bit of singing himself. What he would give to hear that...</p><p>"What about you, Tosaka-san?" Imaichi grinned and turned the question back to him. Omi was startled. Was this the point where he revealed that he was a gamer who locked himself in his room and duped his party members into thinking he was a hot egirl...</p><p>"I, uh... I like watching... youtube... and a bit of online gaming..."</p><p>"Oh! My nephew - oh, he's not my actual nephew but he stays with me - he plays online games too! One of them was... um... hm. Was it, Dragon's Dogma?"</p><p>"That one! It's kind of old, but it's really amazing! They even made a netflix adaptation of it recently... to be honest, I think it wasn't that great. Anyway, the gameplay itself..." Omi when on a bit of a schpeel about it, and Imaichi-san seemed to listen to him patiently with all the appropriate oo's and aah's during pauses. When he stopped himself abashedly and apologised for boring him, Imaichi-san told him - not at all, it was cool to see someone so passionate about their hobbies.</p><p>Cool? RILY thought he was cool?</p><p>Omi worked even harder that afternoon, even if the next day his body would be screaming in agony for it. In the end, he even managed to get his number. Omi sat there on his bed with boxers with hotdogs printed on them, and a towel in his long, mussed hair. He had barely dried his body properly before checking his phone, because Imaichi-san said that he'd send him the link to some videos he liked. And he really did. The links were sitting there on his LINE, along with some very cute emoji's indeed.</p><p>[The scenery really is nice, just like the food ( ‾́ ◡ ‾́ )] He messaged after he had finished watching one.</p><p>[Isn't it so nice! (o´∀`o) I really want to go there when there's free time... could it be a day trip?]</p><p>[I'm sure it can be a day trip. It's only like 2 hours away ]</p><p>[Tosaka-san, do you want to go someday? (＾▽＾)]</p><p>A pause.</p><p>[`Yeah, I wanna!]</p><p>He wondered if he should add to that, but just as his head started to spin, Imaichi-san sent another:</p><p>[We could go together maybe!! I mean, only if you're interested ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶]</p><p>[Ahh sorry! Is that too soon?! It's just because all my co-workers are always so busy (〃＞＿＜;〃)]</p><p>[No, I'd be keen!]</p><p>Scratch that, he would literally dig out his own heart and put it at his feet in exchange for going on a day trip with him. Was he... was he actually dreaming right now? Granted, arranging to go someplace with friends was a kind of thing that is brought up quickly and forgotten just as quickly, no matter how passionate the initial chat had been. Omi tried not to be too excited about it, but before RILY had bid him goodnight he had added -</p><p>[Let's talk more about that trip the next time we meet in person! Goodnight Tosaka-san! (b ᵔ▽ᵔ)b]</p><p>And so, Omi vigorously wanked one out before he went to bed early like a good boy.</p><p> </p><p>tbc.</p>

</p><p>插画：<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/billspilledquill/pseuds/billspilledquill" rel="nofollow">billspilledquill</a></p><hr/><p>梦境在开始时一直很顺利。他的天使RILY把头发剪短了，露出了他脖子上那条优雅的线条。他曾见过另一个男人拥有如此华丽、纤细的脖子吗？他穿的白衬衫正慢慢滑过他的背部，显示出他肩膀的精细形状和完美的背部肌肉。从窗户流进来的柔和光线使衬衫略微透亮。能看和不能看之间的暧昧关系可以让任何人都口干舌燥。</p><p>RILY正慢慢地转向他，他那纤细得要命的腰肢使他的心在翻筋斗。他那45度角的头部倾斜，那甜蜜的目光......。Omi觉得他的整个身体可能会融化成一滩水。但就在他想把屁股从座位上挪开，伸手去抓他的时候，又有人粗暴地从他身边撞了过去。一张非常熟悉的脸。那个恼人的帅哥，一直在群聊中炫耀他的自拍。</p><p>Bakahiro大步走到RILY身边，用他那双圆溜溜的大眼睛和笑靥如花的笑容抢走了那个人的注意力。或者说，这种关注从一开始就不属于他...... Bakahiro的手掌沿着RILY的脸颊拂过，手指划过他的耳壳，然后扫进他柔软的金色发丝里。 Omi想砸碎他钥匙来发泄他的抱怨，但他什么也做不了，只能坐在那里，用双臂紧紧地交叉在胸前，注视着这一幕。</p><p>更近了......他越来越近了...... RILY，为什么他要在Bakahiro俯冲过来抢夺那些本应属于他的小胡子嘴唇时，显得如此心满意足和美丽？该死的家伙！他...</p><p>Omi带着勃起的弟弟醒来，他的身体被汗水浸透了。他是不是吃了什么奇怪的东西，使他的湿梦变成了这样的噩梦？这也可能是由疲劳引起的。最近，他一直在努力锻炼身体......如果他不改善自己，他到底怎么能希望给RILY留下好印象？这其实是有很好的激励作用的。上周，哲也先生以一种不经意的方式告诉他，他们上次送来的建筑公司已经和他们签订了一份装修咖啡馆的合同。这是一个早该进行的装修，是哲也与他的长期恋爱和商业伙伴精心策划了相当长的一段时间。他们终于筹集到了足够的资金，而且Omi也在那里工作，他也可以帮他们一把，使这个过程更快。</p><p>因此，新的洗面奶、面罩、饮食、慢跑...... Omi希望与今市先生的第二次会面能足够好，以代替那糟糕的第一印象。希望他能被眼前这个英俊的咖啡馆工作人员所折服？也许他甚至可以得到他的电话号码？嗯，他是一个真正的白痴吗？无论如何，他挑选了当天能找到的最好的瘦身T恤和牛仔裤，然后紧张地去上班了。</p><p>"你今天来的真早，登坂君。看起来一天比一天好......真高兴！" 哲也用灿烂的笑容向他打招呼。他今天也穿着T恤和牛仔裤，而不是衬衫，因为他也要参与一些拆除过程。"施工人员已经在路上了。我已经泡好了咖啡，这样我们就可以在开始之前一起看一下图纸......你能不能也帮忙做一下三明治？只剩下一些了。" Omi立即同意了，妈的，他要准备这辈子最好的三明治。</p><p>过了一会儿，他们终于过来了。Omi和哲也赶紧走到入口处，向他们每个人鞠躬问好。啊......他来了。今市先生，他真的......哦，他真的剪了头发！就像他在现场直播中随意地、也许是令人毛骨悚然地建议的那样......妈的，看起来真不错。那人似乎抓住了他徘徊的目光，略微疑惑地歪了一下头，又给了他一个灿烂的微笑。他们都做了一些自我介绍，然后哲也先生把大家领到一张大桌子前坐下来用餐。</p><p>这是再好不过的一天了。有些地方很辛苦；他满头大汗，把东西搬进搬出，让他喘不过气来。即使今市先生看起来很娇小，但他有牛一样的力量。就在他认为自己不能再深深地爱上他的时候。当然，除了脸颊上偶尔出现的红晕，这些都没有显示在Omi的碧池臉上。这中间有一段时间，他有机会和他开始对话的窗口。</p><p>Omi可以在网上聊天，但在现实生活中，在他暗恋的人面前？那是相当高难度的。</p><p>然而，向这个男人询问他发布的视频和他特别喜欢的食物证明是一个成功的策略。今市先生很高兴地告诉他所有他认为最美味的东西，以及他是如何碰巧遇到其中一些餐馆的。他还发现这个人喜欢90年代的R&amp;B音乐，而且自己也喜欢唱。他真想听听......</p><p>"你呢，登坂先生？"今市咧嘴一笑，把问题转回给他。Omi被吓了一跳。难道这就是他透露自己是一个把自己锁在房间里的游戏者，并且欺骗他的党员，让他们以为他是一个性感的女孩的地方吗？</p><p>"我，呃......我喜欢看......youtube......和一些在线游戏......"</p><p>"哦！我的侄子--哦，他不是我真正的侄子，但他和我住在一起--他也玩在线游戏！其中一个是......嗯......嗯。是,《龙的传人》,吗？"</p><p>"那一个！它有点老了，但真的很棒！他们甚至制作了一个Netflix的改编版。......说实话，我认为它并不怎么好。总之，游戏本身..." Omi说得很认真，而今市先生似乎很耐心地听他说，并在停顿时适当地发出了哼声。当他羞愧地停下，为自己的无聊而道歉时，今市先生告诉他--一点也不，看到有人对自己的爱好如此热情，这很酷。</p><p>酷？RILY认为他很酷？</p><p>Omi在那个下午更加努力地工作，即使第二天他的身体会因此而痛苦地叫唤。最后，他甚至设法得到了他的号码。Omi坐在他的床上，穿着印有热狗的四角裤，在他长长的、乱糟糟的头发里放了一条毛巾。他几乎没有好好擦干身体，就查看了他的手机，因为今市先生说他会把一些他喜欢的视频的链接发给他。他真的这样做了。这些链接就在他的LINE上，还有一些非常可爱的表情符号。</p><p>他在看完一个视频后发来消息说：</p><p>[风景真的很好，就像食物一样( ‾́ ◡ ‾́ )]</p><p>[这不是很好吗？(o´∀`o)我真想在有空闲的时候去那里......能不能来个一日游？］</p><p>[相信可以一日游，只有两个小时的路程。］</p><p>[登坂先生，有机会想去吗? (＾▽＾)] 。</p><p>暂停一下。</p><p>[我想！]</p><p>他想知道自己是否应该补充一下，但就在他的脑袋开始转动的时候，今市先生又发来了一个。</p><p>[我们也许可以一起去！是说，如果你有兴趣的话٩(。-́‿-̀。)۶]</p><p>[啊，对不起! 这是不是太快了? 只是因为我的同事们总是很忙(〃＞＿；〃)]</p><p>[不，我想和你去！]</p><p>划重点，他真的会把自己的心挖出来，放在他的脚下，以换取和他一起去一日游。他......他现在真的在做梦吗？当然，安排和朋友去某个地方是一种很快就会被提起的事情，而且很快就会被忘记，不管最初的聊天有多热烈。Omi尽量不让自己太激动，但在RILY向他道晚安之前，他又说了一句--</p><p>[我们下次见面的时候再详细谈谈这次旅行吧！晚安，登坂先生。(b ᵔ▽ᵔ)b]</p><p>就这样，在他像个好孩子一样早早上床睡觉之前，Omi大力地打了一次手淫。</p><p> </p><p>tbc.</p>
