      <p>There are two things that annoy Iwata Takanori. The first thing is insects, the second thing is his brother Omi. Why? Because He's been talking on the phone all day. They are now attending a fashion show in Paris together.  While he is excited about traveling abroad in years but his older brother keeps on talking on the phone with his boyfriend—Imaichi Ryuji since they arrived at a hotel in Paris until now.</p><p>“Can you two stop acting like high school sweethearts talking on the phone 24 hours a day?” Iwata grumbled at Omi, but didn't expect his brother to hear him grumble.</p><p>5 minutes have passed</p><p>“Omi-san, I'm hungry I don't want to eat at the hotel please take me out to eat something.”</p><p>15 minutes passed, no response from Omi.<br/>

“What's that, oh Ryuji!, did you change your earrings? you didn't tell me!  It's cute and suits you well. No, whatever you wear looks good………”</p><p>30 minutes have passed<br/>
“Ryuji, are you going to take a shower? What is that? Did you get bitten by an insect? Why is your neck scratched like that? Your chest too?  Maybe you should see a doctor? Can Ken-chan go with you…,”</p><p>What a stupid brother! It's probably a bug bite an insect that looks like you! Iwata thought in his mind. If waiting for Omi to go out with him, today he probably won't eat anything. Thought, so he walks out of the hotel to have something to eat alone.</p><p>Iwata hates his brother!</p>
