      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Based on the recent interview where Ryuji revealed that he ran into Omi in the elevator in the Tokyo RILY's Night.

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Tired. Exhausted, really, but he still felt good. There's always that nagging feeling of 'I could've done better'; of course there was. He was a perfectionist when it came to his craft. Most importantly, however, the fans had a good experience. Their smiles, their laughter, the oscillation of 5000 RILY lights in the stadium were surely proof of that. Ryuji released a deep sigh. It was with a soft smile on his lips that he turned the corridor towards the lifts. He was adjusting the hem of the fresh t-shirt when the elevator stopped on his floor. With a slow grumble, the doors slid open.</p><p>Ryuji had pulled out his phone and stepped in with barely a glance at the other passenger. His familiar scent came to him before anything else. The door closed behind them before his partner's arm had looped around his back, tugging him close. His phone almost dropped out of his hand as he looked up, eyes wide and suddenly full of light.</p><p>"Omi! What're you doing here!" His heart had almost tumbled out of his mouth and leapt through the ceiling. But he was laughing - overjoyed, cheeks flushing pink, free hand clutching at his partner's jacket as he was tugged towards the corner of the little metal box. "Did you come to watch the concert?"</p><p>"No, I just came to kidnap you in the elevator - of course I did, silly." Omi looked like a spoiled princess when he giggled like that. Yes, he really did giggle, despite the resting bitch face. He wanted to kiss the mole under his eyes, kiss his slightly chubby-looking cheeks, but neither of them knew when the lift would stop again to take in the next passenger. Thus, Omi let him go, and they kept a safe distance between them while they savoured this short, precious time they had together.</p><p>"Thanks for coming, Omi... that means a lot."</p><p>"Of course I had to come."</p><p>We're partner's, right? While it wasn't spoken aloud, Ryuji could see it loud and clear in his eyes. Naoto-san told him once, when he had been so frustrated with Omi: if you stop your airheadedness for a moment, and really look, you would be able to tell. How his gaze always falls back upon you, how it never wavers. That look is because of you, it's for you, and you only.</p><p>Little by little, Ryuji was understanding those words better. Head titled slightly to rest against the wall, he gazed back at him; eyes half-lidded in sleepy satedness. Omi, could you hold me right now? If you're not too busy, could you spend the night with me, hugging me and kissing me? Just like his lyrics, the mental verbalisation of his desires were rather straightforward.</p><p>"Isn't it... taking a bit of a long time?" Omi said in a moment, when they had eyeballed each other in silence for long enough. </p><p>"Oh, you're r-</p><p>He almost lost his footing as the elevator shook abruptly and came to a shuddering stop. The lights overhead flickered, before going out altogether. There was a little scream before Omi bumped heavily into him. The buzzing red of the emergency call button was the only light that remained.</p><p>"You screamed like a girl, Omi..."</p><p>"No I didn't! You're the wimp who pees with the door ajar at night!"</p><p>The two bickered for a moment before dissolving into childish giggles after all. Funnily enough, neither of them reached for the the call button. Tacit understanding had various uses, after all. He could hardly make out Omi's features in the darkness, but that helped to heighten other senses... including the sound of Omi's breath, heavy and slightly quickened, fanning over his cheek. Ryuji lifted his chin, his lips brushing over Omi's chin in the process. And with another minute turn of their heads, their lips finally met.</p><p>The first kiss in almost a month. The slightest touch of those plush lips against his were enough to make him release a low whimper of desperation. He wasn't alone in this. After a few painful bumps of Omi's knees against his leg, he had successfully pressed his back to the corner of the lift. Omi's thick, adorable fingers were sliding up the back of his head and sweeping into his hair as their kiss deepened. He drank up Omi's groans as his hands fumbled under his jacket and shirt in search for bare skin.</p><p>"Can you..." Ryuji felt a trail of drool roll down the corner of his mouth as their lips parted with a smack. </p><p>"Huh?" Omi had turned to kissing and nibbling up his jawline at present, expertly finding all of his sensitive spots.</p><p>"Say you love me..."</p><p>"Huh..."</p><p>Omi's nose pressed upon his cheek. Could he feel just how red they were? His fingers slid over Omi's slightly softer body, waiting.</p><p>"I love you, Ryuji... were you holding your breath? Stupid."</p><p>"Then what's with the dramatic pause! Jerk!"</p><p>"Ha. And what about you?"</p><p>"I love you too, Omi. Jerk."</p><p>The heavy kisses resumed; his fingers entwined over the back of Omi's neck, while Omi's hands were travelling under his tee to map out his body greedily. Raising goosebumps and shudders wherever they went; playing over his ribcage as though they were piano keys; fondling his chest and rubbing his nipples into stiff peaks.</p><p>It felt so good that he might melt on the spot. His schedule had been so busy that he hardly even had the time to feel sexually frustrated. With just the tiniest prompting from Omi, however, all of that was bubbling to the surface at great speed. </p><p>"You're so sensitive."</p><p>The hot whisper against his earlobe made him arch his body towards the teasing hands. Omi rolled his pelvis against him, letting him know just how much he missed him as well. He felt like his legs had just turned to jelly at this point; if it weren't for Omi's body pinning him there, he might just slide down to the floor.</p><p>"But it's been so long since..."</p><p>"I know, baby."</p><p>Baby! Fuck, he might as well just cum in his pants here and now! </p><p>"I... I don't wanna do this here..." His voice had taken on a breathless, slightly whining quality as his mind took its remaining braincells to focus on making himself as delectable as possible to the other man.</p><p>"Can't say it's ideal but-" Omi paused to roll his hips against him, the motion making both of them moan wantonly. "This is pretty exciting too, isn't it?"</p><p>"But... But we can't..."</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Can't go all the way... I want Omi's..."</p><p>The last braincells had really done a fabulous job. He was hearing a cheerful melody of victory in his head as Omi growled like a famished bear by his ear. The grinds were more vigorous now, so much so that he accidentally hit the back of his head on one particular thrust.</p><p>"Fuck, Ryuji... say it, say it properly. You want my what?"</p><p>"Omi's cock, I want Omi's cock, I want it -</p><p>Like so, it didn't take long at all for these 35+ year old horny teenagers to climax while dry humping each other in a broken lift. Omi was muttering all kinds of profanities against his sweat-dampened neck as their bodies shuddered from the aftermath. Ryuji's fingers clutched at the back of Omi's jacket, his moustache and chin fuzz tickling the man's fair cheek as he kissed him over and over again.</p><p>"Omi... should we, um... call for help now?"</p><p>"Shit. I guess so..."</p><p>"But will you come over tonight..."</p><p>"Of course I will, you idiot. Wanna fuck you properly, fucking damn it."</p><p>He would've preferred something more romantic like 'making love to you' and so forth, but they did just go at it like rabbits in an elevator. </p><p>"You'll stay the night, won't you?" His voice must've sounded small and lonely enough that Omi's palm cupped his face once more, and a lingering, tender kiss placed upon his lips.</p><p>"Yes, Ryuji. I have to kiss you goodnight, don't I?" Omi was chuckling softly, his thumb stroking gently over his cheekbone. Ah, how he wanted to go there right now. Teleport straight to the bedroom, in the arms of his fated person where he belonged. They just had to survive the conversation with whoever came to rescue them, and hop into their respective vehicles with soaked underwear like nothing had happened...</p><p>"Yes. At least ten times," Ryuji answered with a breathless, melodic laugh, before reaching out for the button.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>fin.</p>

    <p>Chapter Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>根据最近的采访，龙二透露，在东京RILY之夜的电梯里碰到了omi。在微博上各种讨论的鼓励下，这篇小说诞生了 :) 我已经写了另一篇基于东京RILY's Night的小说，但有了这个信息，它已经变得与事实（？）不符了 lmao</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>累了。疲惫不堪，真的，但他仍然感觉不错。总有一种 "我本可以做得更好 "的唠叨感觉；当然有。当谈到他的技艺时，他是一个完美主义者。然而，最重要的是，粉丝们有一个良好的体验。他们的笑容，他们的笑声，体育场内5000个RILY灯的摆动，肯定是证明了这一点。隆二释放了一个深深的叹息。他的嘴角带着柔和的微笑，转过走廊走向电梯。当电梯停在他所在的楼层时，他正在调整那件新T恤的下摆。随着一声缓慢的咕噜声，门被推开了。</p><p>隆二已经掏出了他的手机，几乎没有看一眼其他乘客就跨了进去。他熟悉的气味先于其他东西向他袭来。门在他们身后关上了，然后他的伙伴的手臂环抱着他的背部，把他拉近。当他抬起头时，他的手机几乎从他手中掉了下来，眼睛睁得大大的，突然充满了光亮。</p><p>"Omi! 你在这里做什么！" 他的心几乎从嘴里翻了出来，跳过了天花板。但他在笑--欣喜若狂，脸颊泛起粉红色，当他被拽向小金属箱的角落时，空出的手紧紧抓住他伙伴的外套。"你是来观看音乐会的吗？"</p><p>"不，我只是来绑架电梯里的你--当然是，傻子。" Omi这样傻笑的时候，看起来像个被宠坏的公主。是的，他真的咯咯笑了起来，尽管平常都是挂着婊子脸。他想亲吻他眼下的痣，亲吻他看起来有点胖的脸颊，但他们都不知道电梯什么时候会再次停下来，接纳下一位乘客。因此，Omi放开了他，之间保持着安全的距离，同时品味着他们在一起的这段短暂而宝贵的时间。</p><p>"谢谢你能来，Omi......我很开心。"</p><p>"我当然要来。"</p><p>因为我们是伙伴的，对吗？虽然没有大声说出来，但隆二可以从他的眼睛里响亮和清晰地看到。当他对Omi感到非常沮丧的时候，直人先生曾经告诉他：如果你真正看一看，你就会知道。他的目光如何总是落在你身上，如何从未动摇过。那目光是因为你，只是为了你。</p><p>渐渐地，隆二对这些话有了更好的理解。他的头微微地靠在墙上，回过头来凝视着他；眼睛半眯着，带着困倦的满足感。Omi，你能不能现在就抱着我？如果你不忙的话，你能不能和我一起过夜，拥抱我，亲吻我？就像他的歌词一样，他的欲望的心理口头表达相当直白。</p><p>"不是......以经等了很久吗？？" Omi在他们沉默地注视着对方足够长的时间后说。</p><p>"哦，是...</p><p>当电梯突然摇晃并颤抖着停下来时，他几乎失去了脚步。头顶上的灯闪烁着，然后完全熄灭。在Omi重重地撞上他之前，有一声小小的尖叫。嗡嗡作响的红色紧急呼叫按钮是唯一剩下的灯光。</p><p>"你像个女孩一样尖叫，Omi..."</p><p>"才没有! 晚上去小便的时候在门上留个口子的人不就是你吗？！"</p><p>两人争吵了一会儿，然后终究还是陷入了孩子气的笑声中。有趣的是，他们都没有伸手去按呼叫按钮。默契毕竟有各种用途。在黑暗中，他几乎看不清Omi的脸，但这有助于提高其他感官......包括Omi的呼吸声，沉重而略显急促，在他的脸颊上扇动。隆二抬起他的头，嘴唇在这个过程中拂过Omi的下巴。他们的头又转了一下，嘴唇终于相遇了。</p><p>这是近一个月来的初吻。那双嘴唇对他的轻微触碰就足以让他释放出充满欲望的低沉呜咽。在这一点上，他并不孤单。在Omi的膝盖与他的腿碰撞了几下后，他成功地将自己的背部压在了电梯的角落里。随着他们的吻加深，Omi那粗大、可爱的手指从他的后脑勺滑上去，扫进他的头发。当他的手在他的外套和衬衫下摸索着寻找裸露的皮肤时，他喝下了Omi的呻吟。</p><p>"你能不能......" 当他们的嘴唇分开时，隆二感觉到一串口水从他的嘴角滚落。</p><p>"啊？" Omi此刻已经转而亲吻和啃咬他的下颚线，熟练地找到他所有的敏感点。</p><p>"说你爱我......"</p><p>"嗯......"</p><p>Omi的鼻子压在他的脸颊上。他能感觉到到底有多红吗？他的手指滑过Omi略微柔软的身体，等待着。</p><p>"我爱你，隆二......你以为我不会说吗？傻子。"</p><p>"那你为什么要让我等那么久！？笨蛋！"</p><p>"哈，那你呢？"</p><p>"我也爱你，Omi。笨蛋。"</p><p>沉重的亲吻又开始了；他的手指在Omi的脖子后面缠绕着，而Omi的手则在他的T恤下面贪婪地描绘着他的身体。他们所到之处都会引起颤抖；在他的肋骨上弹奏，仿佛它们是钢琴键；抚摸他的胸部，把他的乳头揉成坚硬的山峰。</p><p>这种感觉非常好，他可能会当场融化。他的日程安排是如此繁忙，以至于他几乎没有时间去想性爱的事情。然而，在Omi最细微的触碰下，所有的欲望都以极快的速度涌现出来。</p><p>"你好敏感。"</p><p>贴在他耳垂上的火热的低语使他把身体拱向那双挑逗的手。Omi在他身上滚动骨盆，让他知道自己也有多想念他。他觉得自己的腿此时已经变成了果冻；如果不是Omi的身体把他固定在那里，他可能就会滑倒在地板上。</p><p>"已经有这么长时间没有......"</p><p>"我知道，宝贝。"</p><p>宝贝！妈的，他还不如现在就射在他的裤子里!</p><p>"我......我不想在这里做这个......" 他的声音带着喘息，略带抱怨，因为他的大脑把剩余的脑细胞集中在使自己尽可能地成为某个男人最爱吃的豪华菜谱。</p><p>"不能说这是最理想的地方，但是......" Omi对他的臀部滚动，这个动作使他们两人都肆意地呻吟起来。"这也是很刺激的，不是吗？"</p><p>"但是... 但是我们不能......"</p><p>"不能什么？"</p><p>"不能做到最后...... 我想要Omi的......"</p><p>剩余的脑细胞真的做了一件了不起的事。当Omi像一只饥肠辘辘的熊一样在他耳边咆哮时，他的脑子里听到了欢快的胜利旋律。现在研磨的力度更大了，以至于他在某次滚动时不小心撞到了自己的后脑勺。</p><p>"妈的，隆二......说吧，好好说。你想要我的什么？"</p><p>"Omi的鸡巴，我想要Omi的鸡巴，想要--"。</p><p>像这样，根本没过多久，这些35岁以上的好色少年就在破旧的电梯里互相干呕，达到了高潮。当他们的身体因后而颤抖时，Omi对着他被汗水浸湿的脖子嘀咕着各种脏话。隆二的手指紧紧抓住Omi的外套，他的小胡子和下巴上的绒毛挠着Omi雪白的脸颊，一遍又一遍地吻着他。</p><p>"Omi......我们是否应该，嗯......现在打电话求救？"</p><p>"该死。没办法......"</p><p>"但是你今晚会过来吗..."</p><p>"我当然会，你这个傻子。想好好地干你，妈的。"</p><p>他本想听到一些更浪漫的话，比如 "和你做爱 "之类的，但他们刚刚确实就像兔子一样在电梯里做了那样的事。</p><p>"你会留下来过夜的，对吗？" 他的声音听起来一定很渺小和孤独，以至于Omi的手掌再次捏住了他的脸，一个缠绵的、温柔的吻放在他的嘴唇上。</p><p>"是的，隆二。我要吻你晚安，不是吗？" Omi轻轻地笑着，他的拇指轻轻地抚摸着他的颧骨。啊，他多么想现在就去那里。直接传送到卧室，在他命中注定的人的怀抱中，他属于的那里。他们只需熬过与前来营救他们的人的谈话，然后带着湿透的内衣跳进各自的车辆，就像什么也没发生过一样......</p><p>"是的，至少十次，"隆二回答时发出了悠扬的笑声，然后伸手去按按钮。</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>fin.</p>
