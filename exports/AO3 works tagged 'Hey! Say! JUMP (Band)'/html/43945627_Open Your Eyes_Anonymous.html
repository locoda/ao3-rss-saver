    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>”Hey, sensei…” Yuto smiles, a little drunker than he wants to be but that’s okay. It’s just the two of them at a secluded table.</p><p>“Oh stop calling me that,” Shige protests over his glass of beer, waving his hand like he’s trying to brush Yuto’s honorific aside. The alcohol glows pink on his cheeks and it’s really cute.</p><p>”Aw, why?” Yuto pouts exaggeratedly, mindlessly playing with a coaster as he watches Shige make a bothered face. ”You’re a celebrated writer and all.”</p><p>”It sounds kinky,” Shige’s nose scrunches up a little and he subconsciously twirls one of his earrings a little.</p><p>”Oh?” Yuto raises an eyebrow, his interest sparking and he shifts a little in his seat, carefully watching Shige’s face as his fingers freeze on the coaster. ”Is that a bad thing?”</p><p>He’s been interested in Shige for a long time. Years, actually. They see a lot less of each other these days, but when Yuto got the role in Pink to Grey, he was genuinely most excited to get to bond with Shige.</p><p>They’ve spoken about things he doesn’t talk to anyone about. About how he wishes he too could have a stage name to hide behind like the models or actors in Shige's book and in reality. About being overshadowed by someone else glowing brighter than you without even trying. About trying to achieve the same goal as your friends and inevitably ending up being worse than some and better than some while still trying to be supportive in both directions. About possibly feeling things you’re not supposed to for someone you’re definitely not allowed to and choosing to repress it.</p><p>He’s been on Shige’s couch drinking whiskey and crying preparing for Pink to Grey, Shige’s dark eyes watching him with a deeper understanding than he’s ever felt.</p><p>But Shige was always careful to keep it professional. To keep a physical distance between them, to veer the conversation away from the sexual aspects Yuto tried to push at when discussing the movie. Brushed him off and said that the physical was just secondary to the internal struggle, and that’s where the focus should be.</p><p>Shige’s never opened the door to talk about sex in any way. Until now, apparently.</p><p>”Yeah, it sounds like one of those JGV teacher/student things,” Shige goes on, musing more to the window than Yuto, and Yuto wets his lips at the unexpected information.</p><p>”… You watch gay porn then?” he asks, going for casual but he just sounds like a stupid drunk trying to understand what was just said.</p><p>Shige looks at Yuto for a moment before sipping some more of his beer, eyes dark and expressive, but Yuto can’t tell if he’s amused or irritated.</p><p>”Don’t you?” Shige finally asks, and that’s definitely a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>”I…” Yuto starts, then wets his lips again, clearing his throat, busy trying not to picture the man in front of him jerking off watching two men. ”I mean, it happens.”</p><p>”It happens,” Shige repeats, and he definitely doesn’t believe Yuto’s words. He chuckles, showing off perfect white teeth. ”You don’t have to lie to me you know. You never used to.”</p><p>The words hit Yuto harder than he thought they would, and he starts tapping a nervous rhythm against his almost empty beer glass. Maybe it’s the implication that Shige’s actually interested in him too, or that Shige too thinks about their Pink to Grey bonding and misses it.</p><p>”I watch it a lot,” he confesses finally, looking up under lashes, and Shige’s smile makes him feel like a nervous child in front of an adored senpai again.</p><p>”See, that wasn’t so hard,” Shige says, lightly, like he’s ready to start talking about the weather instead, but Yuto’s not ready to drop this opportunity.</p><p>”You never wanted to hear about it before,” Yuto points out, and his voice comes out a little lower, both in volume and tone.</p><p>Shige blinks, watching him more carefully for a long moment that makes Yuto feel like he’s being x-rayed and Shige can see into his soul.</p><p>”Yeah I did,” Shige says then, his deep voice a little breathy and Yuto holds back a noise.</p><p>”… Oh,” is all he manages, embarrassed to find himself tongue tied when he can usually say all kinds of filth, but it feels different in front of Shige. Like he’s not quite good enough to speak to him that way. A waiter passes a couple metres away and Yuto feels himself blush.</p><p>”Nakajima, do you want to come over?” Shige asks then, sounding very official suddenly, and Yuto just nods.</p><p>He’s been to Shige’s place before. It’s calm and quiet, somehow furnished like Shige’s personality.</p><p>”Do you want some cheap wine? I don’t have much else,” Shige asks, the first thing he speaks since they left the bar, and Yuto agrees that yeah, sure.</p><p>He looks around, noticing a new little table since the last time he was here, but otherwise it looks mostly the same. He gets an inexplicable feeling of nervosity as he shrugs out of his coat and sets his shoes aside neatly. He’s not sure what to do with himself, so he ends up just standing around in the hall, blindly checking his phone until Shige comes back.</p><p>”Red?” Shige asks, returning from the kitchen with a bottle and two glasses.</p><p>”I like red,” Yuto shrugs, and Shige smiles at him with a suggestive raised eyebrow that makes him frown.</p><p>”Good,” is all Shige says, guiding him along to the couch where Yuto’s gotten drunk before. Not on wine though.</p><p>The bottle has a screw cork and the initial crack as it loosens is loud in the room when Shige turns it. Yuto carefully sits down on the couch to avoid just standing around looking even more awkward, but ends up sitting on the edge of his seat and still feeling awkward.</p><p>Shige holds the bottle at the bottom as he pours them both wine, and Yuto watches his fingers and tries not to think too hard about them. Shige sits down and the silence is suffocating.</p><p>There’s a moment and Yuto wets his lips, thinking about reaching for his wine glass without actually doing it.</p><p>Then Shige laughs softly and the tension seems to dissolve like smoke in the air.</p><p>”What’s up with you? You’re never this weird,” Shige says, amusement tingling in his voice, and Yuto shrugs uncomfortably before decidedly reaching for his glass. Pretending his hands aren’t sweaty.</p><p>”I don’t know, my heart is beating like crazy,” Yuto finally confesses, and it feels good, but doesn’t help his heart rate go down at all.</p><p>”It’s just cheap wine,” Shige smiles, but the way he raises his glass in a toast is teasing and Yuto can’t help feeling tense in a different way.</p><p>He raises his glass back before trying the wine, and it tastes like late summer nights, cheap cigarettes and sloppy kisses.</p><p>”It’s really not very good,” Yuto comments, and Shige shrugs, sipping some more of his own.</p><p>”Someone left it here,” he explains, and Yuto wonders.</p><p>”Sure, blame someone else,” Yuto teases instead of asking what he really wants, and Shige rolls his eyes.</p><p>”Have you become too posh to drink just to drink?” he asks, and Yuto thinks that technically, they both have. But it’s nice to pretend.</p><p>”I haven’t done it in a long time?” he explains himself with a question, and Shige nods slowly like he agrees.</p><p>”It was fun, wasn’t it? Being 20 and young and not understanding consequences properly?” he asks, and somehow, Yuto finds it hard to picture Shige like that. Finds it much easier to picture other members of News and it puts Shige in the shadow.</p><p>”Were you wild?” Yuto asks, genuinely curious, but Shige just laughs.</p><p>”I’ve never been,” he admits, but he doesn’t sound regretful. ”Not like that at least.”</p><p>”I was,” Yuto says, and Shige tilts his head towards him slowly, eyes dark and clear.</p><p>”I know,” Shige tells him, voice low and deep and Yuto wets his lips, raising his glass to his lips to cover it up. ”Word got around.”</p><p>”Yeah?” Yuto asks, even though he already knows. ”What did it say about me?”</p><p>Shige raises an eyebrow like he already knows that Yuto knows, but the hint of a smile says he enjoys playing along.</p><p>”That you… were a bit loose,” Shige starts, words drawling a bit, swirling the red liquid in his wine glass and watching it move. ”Intense… And not afraid to get on your knees in front of a senpai.”</p><p>The last bit is emphasised with a deep look, eyes black, knowing and teasing at the same time, and Yuto draws a deep breath.</p><p>”I’m not that loose anymore,” he defends himself, and Shige sips some wine, watching him with interest as he speaks. ”But I’m still intense. And… I’m not afraid to get on my knees in front of… a select few senpai.”</p><p>He raises an eyebrow a millimetre in question at the last part, but Shige just smiles.</p><p>”Is there a list?” he asks, and Yuto can’t make out if he’s interested or curious or possibly both.</p><p>”If there was, you’d be at the top of it,” Yuto says, channelling all the tingles in his body into the words, and the sentence comes out forceful, deep.</p><p>Shige tilts his head, a centimetre, maybe two, expression unchanging for a moment, then there’s a touch of impressed across his features. He nods towards the floor before him. ”Go on then.”</p><p>Yuto blinks once, twice, before his brain processes the blunt invitation after so much dancing around innuendos. Then he scrambles to set his glass down and slide to the floor, movements so urgent that Shige laughs.</p><p>That’s okay, the laughter only turns Yuto on more.</p><p>The floor is cold under his knees and he’s really getting too old for this kind of thing, but Shige’s smiling down at him with his glass of wine still in hand, and Yuto feels 20 again.</p><p>He smiles back, raising his hands to Shige’s thighs, feeling the heat of his body through the jeans.</p><p>”Not afraid at all,” Shige comments, voice low and Yuto doesn’t care what he’s saying as long as he talks.</p><p>Shige’s legs spread under Yuto’s curious hands, and he slides closer, smelling warm fabric and rubbing his fingertips over the rough material to create some friction.</p><p>He doesn’t reply, busy with the offering in front of him, which is hardening visibly before his eyes. Shige shifts a little closer to the edge of his seat, and Yuto accepts the invitation, leaning in further to press a kiss against the denim covering his erection.</p><p>Shige sighs above him, and as Yuto glances up, his eyes are closed and head slightly tilted.</p><p>Dark eyes open while he watches, and Yuto physically shudders at the look he receives.</p><p>”You look so good down there,” Shige tells him, voice growing progressively rougher, huskier, and Yuto’s hands grasp Shige’s belt before he can think further. ”I wondered how you would look.”</p><p>”Yeah?” Yuto’s encouragement is more breath than anything, mostly ripping open Shige’s belt before moving on to the jeans' button and zipper.</p><p>”Yeah,” Shige agrees, hips shifting to help Yuto tug at his clothes, wine glass still leisurely held in his hand. ”I heard the stories and I wondered. Regretted never getting to know.”</p><p>”I’m better at it now than I was then,” Yuto promises, reassuring, tugging down waistbands and unable to keep from brushing fingertips against hot skin.</p><p>Shige’s breath is both laughter and gasp, but he doesn’t speak as he watches his erection spring free, hard and hot, and Yuto can’t take his eyes off it.</p><p>There’s a second of pause, silence, before Yuto reaches out.</p><p>”Lucky me,” Shige breathes out as Yuto’s fingers wrap around the base of his erection and tries out a slow, deliberate stroke. Getting the feel for it, testing.</p><p>His reward is a shift of hips, a sharp intake of breath, and Yuto tries again. He tries until a harder stroke earns him a moan, rough and deep and uncontrolled, and it’s all Yuto can do not to swallow him whole.</p><p>But he’s wondered for a long time too, so he tries to take his time.</p><p>He leans in further to lick at the head, lapping up a bead of precome that tastes bitter and somehow forbidden, and he loves it.</p><p>Shige’s voice goes higher, more like his singing vocals, and a hand moves to Yuto’s shoulder, just holding, but the weight feels reassuring.</p><p>Yuto parts his lips and tilts his head towards the hand, pointedly, longingly, taking in hard flesh between his lips.</p><p>Shige gasps above him, and Yuto glances up, finding Shige's brow furrowed and eyes closed. He slides down Shige's cock until he almost gags, swallows once and slips back to the head, repeats and adds some suction.</p><p>Shige’s hand finally catches on that he wants it to move, and as Shige’s fingertips brush his neck Yuto moans around the cock in his mouth.</p><p>The response is a jerk of hips and a sharp intake of breath.</p><p>”Do you like that?” Shige asks, but it’s not a question, not really. Not with how his fingertips run along up Yuto's jugular, jaw, brushing the corner of his mouth that’s wet with saliva. ”I guess you do…”</p><p>It’s not hard to guess since Yuto’s leaning into every touch like a cat, his own erection throbbing in his pants like he’s getting the blowjob rather than giving it.</p><p>”You’re so very pretty,” Shige goes on, and Yuto makes a noise in response, squeezing the base of Shige’s erection a little tighter and it gives him a moan two octaves above Shige's speaking voice.</p><p>Yuto swallows again and Shige’s hand curls against his temple where it’s slowly heading towards his hair. The tiny scratch of blunt nails makes Yuto’s hips jerk and he feels like a teenager in his reactions. But he doesn’t mind. He rarely feels like that these days.</p><p>He ups the pace and his jaw is getting tired, Shige’s fingers carefully twirling strands of his hair. It feels so nice but part of him wants Shige to grab his hair and force his dick down Yuto’s throat.</p><p>He looks up at the man above him, and sees him looking back through dark, heavily lidded eyes. The wine glass is still in his hand and his bangs hang into his face, and Yuto feels so dirty without being able to say why. It doesn’t matter.</p><p>Finally, there’s a thrust up, mostly involuntary, the sudden movement making saliva spill down Yuto’s chin.</p><p>”Close,” Shige says, voice so low it feels like the entire room vibrates, and Yuto doubles his efforts, pumping the base with more purpose and lapping at the head with less.</p><p>Shige comes with a groan that makes tingles shoot up Yuto’s spine, hot bitterness spilling straight onto his tongue.</p><p>He swallows without making a face, carefully cleaning up remnants with his tongue and glancing up at the man catching his breath above him.</p><p>Shige slowly strokes hair behind Yuto’s ear, his heaving breath slowly calming down, and the black of his eyes seems to suck Yuto in until he’s crawling up into Shige’s lap.</p><p>He doesn’t expect to be kissed but he is, Shige’s lips easing his own apart like he didn’t just swallow a mouthful of cum, stroking more hair behind his ear and Yuto’s mind is lost.</p><p>There’s a hand at the fastenings of his jeans and before Yuto can even think about helping there’s a confident hand grasping his erection, starting to stroke. It’s firm and good and everything Yuto needs, and he finds himself half whimpering into the kiss, wrapping arms around Shige’s neck to ground himself somewhere.</p><p>He falls out of the kiss as the heat rises in his veins and he has to breathe it out, gasping and moaning as Shige makes magic with his hand.</p><p>Lips relocate to his cheekbone, temple, neck, and Yuto’s noise is pathetic as he feels the orgasm build up faster than he wants it to.</p><p>He comes in his pants under Shige’s fingers, a gentle kiss pressed against his jaw as he creates a swift series of moans.</p><p>He feels disgusting and exhausted in the best way when the tingles pass, cooling cum in his jeans and a tired jaw, saliva dried on his chin.</p><p>”Hot,” Shige whispers against his earlobe, and there’s some sort of aftershock that makes him shudder in Shige’s arms.</p><p>It takes another couple moments for him to regain himself, slowly slipping out of Shige’s lap to sit on the couch and feel stupid about the wetness in his pants.</p><p>Shige looks back at him, a pink flush still clinging to his cheekbones and he raises the wine glass to his lips like nothing happened. ”I’m very lucky to be a select senpai,” he says, smiling, and Yuto blushes furiously for some reason. He didn’t know he could still do that.</p><p>”Uhm, yeah, do you have some sweatpants I could borrow?” he says instead, shifting uncomfortably.</p><p>Shige laughs, setting his glass down on the table finally, and stands, holding a hand out for Yuto.</p><p>”I’ll find some after a shower,” he promises, and the smile makes Yuto’s temporarily retired erection stir.</p><p>”That works,” he agrees brainlessly, before taking Shige’s hand.</p><p><br/>
