<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Soft, smooth, enticing skin, all under his fingertips and all his to take and touch. Yuto drags two fingers up Inoo’s inner thigh, enjoying how his entire body responds to his touch — shivering from sensitivity with a long winded, breathy whine. Pushing Inoo’s bangs to the side reveals lusty half hooded eyes, sending shockwaves straight to his cock currently fully buried within Inoo’s ass.</p><p>“Holy shit, Inoo, you feel good.” With a groan, Yuto leans down, arms wrapping around his pillowy soft body, pulling him closer, inhaling his sweet floral scent, capturing plush lips with his own, buzzing erotically with dirty, sloppy kisses.</p><p>“Yuto…” Inoo moans against him, voice dripping with arousal. “Fuck me.”</p><p>Yuto doesn’t need to be told twice, instantly snapping his hips back and forth in a quick rhythm, aiming for Inoo’s sweet spot. When Inoo cries out, clenching hard around him, Yuto relocates a hand to pin his upper body down as he thrusts to keep him from squirming away from the perfect angle he has him in. His desire to orgasm twists in his stomach in all the best ways, Inoo’s hole molding perfectly around his cock for an airtight lock.</p><p>“Uhh, Yuto?” Yuto stops as Inoo winces, rising just enough to look at him. “Your elbow is, is kinda digging into my… side,” he says in between breaths.</p><p>“Ah!” Yuto pulls his arm back. “Sorry,” he says sheepishly.</p><p>Inoo just giggles, lightly punching his chest. “You were too in the moment,” he teases. “Now hurry up and make me come because we have–” he checks the clock. “5 minutes. I am <em> dying </em> to find out what happens in the next episode.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah, me too,” Yuto shifts position. “I totally think the pretty boy is suspicious.”</p><p>Inoo rolls his eyes. “You only say that because you’ve had your eye on him since episode one.”</p><p>“Duh, because he’s pretty. It’s always the pretty boys who are suspicious,” he makes a face.</p><p>“Well I think it’s the assistant fucking around behind the scenes.”</p><p>Yuto blows air through his nose. “That sounds waaaay too obvious.”</p><p>“Says you!” Inoo shoots back. “There’s no way she just happened to be in the bathroom at the time!”</p><p>“She has an alibi! Oh c’mon, I don’t believe pretty boy happened to be sick when he–” Yuto stops. “We’re wasting time!”</p><p>“Shit, touch me.”</p><p>Knowing how uncomfortable it would be to sit and focus on anything other than their hard ons, Yuto picks up the pace, wrapping his hand around Inoo’s cock. It doesn’t take long before they both come with a stream of moans, but they don’t take the time to relish in their glory before rushing to wipe up their messes.</p><p>“We can clean up later.” Inoo tosses a tissue to the side.</p><p>Yuto winces as it rolls off the bed. “Yuck. You’re lucky we’re not at mine.”</p><p>“We’re also lucky we’re not women who have to pee right after sex.” Inoo finger guns.</p><p>Nonetheless, they get their clothes back on with maybe only one backwards shirt and grab their now cooled popcorn. With eyes glued to the screen just in time, they scoot together under the sheets, mess forgotten. They had prepared quicker than expected, needing a way to kill time before their current show obsession started.</p><p>And well, sex with your best friend is a fun way to pass time.</p><p>Inoo has always been a trustworthy friend since they were kids, growing up together despite Inoo being a few years older. Yuto doesn't have many friends, people often getting turned away from his easily excitable personality and his specific hobbies with his ability to <em> talk</em>.</p><p>But with Inoo, they gladly spend hours upon hours talking about anything and everything, soothing his constantly overthinking brain by spewing out the backlog of words jammed in his head. They could be trying to figure out about the deep and intellectual mysteries of the universe one night and then another Yuto leaves the conversation clutching his newly formed abs from laughing, wondering what the hell kind of nonsense left their mouths.</p><p>Inoo is also the friend Yuto knows will swing by his place or use his GPS tracking to find him if he needs someone or is in trouble. Like that one time he managed to fall into a manhole while drunk in the middle of the night and couldn't get back up.</p><p>They don't talk about that time.</p><p>Anyways.</p><p>Despite both of them being around 30 years old, they're happily single. Inoo is more outgoing, more likely to hook up with strangers while Yuto simply prefers to stay in and tend to himself. But the two friends are comfortable enough to discuss what they enjoy sexually, knowing each other well enough to have a good time… most of the time.</p><p>They also don't talk about the drunken incident that got an action figure's muscular upper body stuck in Yuto's ass and had to go to the emergency room in the middle of the night.</p><p>A lot happens when you’re drunk at night, okay?</p><p>“Ah!” Inoo points at the screen. “Ah-ha! See I told you!” he points at Yuto’s face and back at the screen. “I fucking told you the assistant was working behind the scenes! I fucking <em> knew </em> it! Stuuupid!”</p><p>“Pretty boy let me down.” Yuto puts his head in his hands while Inoo pokes his side, giggling. “Disappointed but not surprised.”</p><p>“Pretty boy is probably dying next,” Inoo grins mischievously, hooking an arm around Yuto’s shoulders.</p><p>“Don’t say that!” Yuto wails, smacking Inoo with a pillow in an attempt to shut him up.</p><p>While Inoo is his (only) best friend, he sure can be annoying sometimes and drive him up a wall. But maybe that’s why they work so well together as friends. Sometimes he doesn’t know what the hell goes on in Inoo’s weird head, just as he doesn’t know what goes on in his own.</p><p>But Yuto does know one thing.</p><p>"I <em>told</em> you, Yuto!"</p><p>He's never going to hear the end of this.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“C’mon Yuto, let’s do some dancing,” Inoo nudges him and points in a general direction. “The club is right there.”</p><p>“Ughhh,” Yuto groans. “Or I could go home and play video games.”</p><p>“You do that all the time,” Inoo pouts, tugging at his jacket. “Pleeease?”</p><p>Yuto had gotten out of work with a message that Inoo just happened to be around the area and wanted to go for some drinks with him because “a cold one after a hard day of work before the weekend hits the spot” and Yuto agreed.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Inoo had other plans when he asked to walk around for a bit first.</p><p>“I’ll buy you a drink?” Inoo suggests.</p><p>Yuto places a finger on his chin in thought. “Two?”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>Once inside the club, the loud music and smell of sweat throws Yuto off balance, his introverted life already starting to drain away. It’s not that he hates clubs, but he doesn’t go often enough to be immediately accustomed to the culture. He turns to his friend, about to yell that maybe this is a bad idea but after tapping on Inoo’s shoulder and getting hit with a ray of sunshine smile, Yuto laughs and shakes his head.</p><p>Maybe a little of this can’t hurt, sometimes introverts could use an extroverted friend.</p><p>“We have to start off with a drink,” Inoo announces, pointing towards the bar. “I am <em> not </em> dancing while sober.”</p><p>Yuto could get behind that idea, thinking a drink would relax him and get him into a better mood. He starts moving first, weaving through people and ignoring Inoo’s cries to slow down. As he gets deeper in and surrounds himself in the club atmosphere, his heart starts thumping along to the music, fiery excitement filling up his chest, itching to join these people and let the music run loose through his body. As he rushes past people with his newfound motivation, his shoulder bumps hard into another person, almost knocking him backwards.</p><p>"Sorry," Yuto yells, embarrassed.</p><p>"Sorry," the man says back, shuffling past.</p><p>Everything would’ve been fine if Yuto didn’t hear that single word. The night would’ve gone on as planned. He would’ve danced the night away with his best friend without worries.</p><p>But…</p><p>That rich, deep voice.</p><p>He knows that God damn voice.</p><p>Muffled ears ringing and time coming to a crawl, Yuto’s eyes widen as a smoky scent among the club smell hits his nose, flooding all his senses, instantly making him light headed as his pumping heart reaches his drying throat. Yuto spins on his heels, catching a glimpse of the back of the person he bumped into before it disappears within the crowd.</p><p>And yet, that tiny glimpse is more than enough for his gut to burn while coiling up, a punch twisting its way through the labyrinth of vines. Luscious curls of dark hair fell nearly to his broad shoulders, fingers twitching to lose themselves among those locks, tug that face closer to his so he can–</p><p>“Yuto?”</p><p>Yuto blinks, the music gradually returning to his senses. “Huh?”</p><p>“C’mon, what are you doing? Let’s go!”</p><p>“Oh– yeah,” Yuto says blankly, Inoo guiding him.</p><p>Once Inoo picks out their drinks, Yuto takes a large gulp not caring what it is, the burn running down his throat nothing like what’s going on in his fluttering stomach. His eyes shift towards the dance floor, continuing to sip at his drink, hoping it would help clear out his head to figure out what the hell is going on.</p><p>Did he imagine who that was?</p><p>Years.</p><p>It's been years since Yuto graduated from college. He double majored in music and photography, loving the arts and lucky to have great internships to secure a well paying photography job now. He only talked to a few people within his majors — preferring to work alone — getting along with them casually as they drudge together to finish projects.</p><p>But during Yuto’s first year, there was one person. One person who wasn't within his acquaintances, yet found himself trapped in his web.</p><p>Takaki Yuya was a senior. Handsome and cool in every way from the top of his dark hair with lightened streaks down to stylish boots or fancy sandals. He was often surrounded by people of all genders, charming people effortlessly with a smile and flick of wrist.</p><p>Yet, at the same time, people said to stay away from him. That he seems sweet but he’ll only break your heart, that he’ll just play with you.</p><p>Yuto was not interested anyways.</p><p><em> Was</em>.</p><p>At the time, Yuto simply liked Yuya’s style, riding motorcycles in leather jackets, but that was the extent to his admiration. He cares more about personality and didn’t care to go out of his way to find opportunities to get to know him, too busy with his own workload to care about a relationship. They didn’t have classes together, not even sure what his major was. He rather stay in his own world.</p><p>But during the weekend before finals, Yuto was approached by Yuya at the campus pub, finding himself stuck in place, captivated by his long hair tied up in a ponytail. It was the first time Yuya stopped in front of him, spreading a warm flush through his face as they spoke. He’s not sure the conversation itself went well, but a tongue was in his mouth at one point… so that was neat. Before Yuto knew it, they ended up hooking up in Yuto’s dorm room, thankful his roommate was home that night.</p><p>That night was the night Yuto thought, <em> wow, college can be pretty fun sometimes</em>.</p><p>All cuddled up and basking in their afterglow, Yuya told him how lovely Yuto was, promised that they’d meet again, that they’d be together longer among all sorts of other words that made Yuto’s heart flutter, understanding what the hype about him was all about.</p><p>But the next morning, Yuya was gone like the wind. Just as people warned.</p><p>They saw each other once more afterwards, even making eye contact, but it was as if they didn’t meet at all.</p><p>As if Yuto was forgotten.</p><p>He felt completely used, kicking himself over falling for stupid words he probably tells everyone he sleeps with. It was silly of him to believe sweet nothings from someone as thorny as Yuya. It was stupid for him to consider giving him his heart to break.</p><p>A nudge breaks his thoughts. "You look like you saw a ghost."</p><p>"I think I did," Yuto says hollowly.</p><p>Inoo tilts his head. “Can I do anything to help?” Yuto shakes his head, Inoo frowning. “You sure?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Yuto says, putting on a smile. “You came here to dance, right?” he gives him a small shove. “Go out there and wow them for me.”</p><p>Inoo hesitates but Yuto gives him another push, “Okay okay, if you need me holla at me!”</p><p>Heading to the middle of the dance floor, he glances back at him a few times before disappearing within the crowd. Yuto’s smile drops when he does, slumping in his seat. He runs a hand through his hair, finishing off his drink.</p><p>He should’ve had Inoo buy his second drink.</p><p>Not feeling like dancing with distant memories flooding his brain, he sits back and watches the party. He likes people watching, intrigued in the way people act and naturally pose, silently analyzing them. His eyes were wandering to a new group when they catch sight of someone slipping past, breath taken away and perking up in his seat.</p><p><em> Takaki Yuya</em>.</p><p>Yuto keeps his eyes on him, hair completely dark and lush as night, shoulders broader, arms and legs thicker. He confidently strides up to a table of people, naturally chatting with them. Yuya has always been a social butterfly unlike him, sensing the charm in his smiles even from a distance, seeing how the table melts for him.</p><p>He squints when he notices a shorter man with brown hair and a middle part standing by Yuya’s side, seemingly stuck like glue to his hip. The man even follows Yuya to the next table, grabbing his bicep to not lose sight of him, lingering touches down his arm when they’re just standing. Yuya gives the man a few looks, not pushing him away, Yuto left wondering what their relationship is if anything.</p><p>Admittedly, the stranger is pretty… But Yuto shakes his head. It’s always the pretty boys, he tells himself. It’s always the pretty boys who are suspicious. And the fact that he’s with Yuya — who's more of the sexy type — makes him more suspicious. The man shakes Yuya’s arm to get his attention, leaning in close to his ear to whisper something. Yuto assumes it’s to ask to leave and fuck, wondering if Yuya was going to push him aside or drag him somewhere else.</p><p>But he does neither.</p><p>Yuya just laughs. He laughs at whatever that man said. Yuya leans into the other man’s ear to respond, making him laugh too.</p><p>It fills Yuto with something he can’t quite place, wondering if he's his boyfriend or something. But Yuya never dated in college. He'd sleep with anyone he had remote interest in, only for the interest to fade out right after.</p><p>Taken from first hand experience.</p><p>But that was years ago, so maybe he changed? They could just be friends, but what friends would touch their arms like that? </p><p>“Yuuuto.”</p><p>Yuto jumps as Inoo appears within his vision with puffed out cheeks. “Inoo-chan? What are you–?”</p><p>“I should be asking you that, scowly face,” Inoo points out. “Lucky that glass you’re holding is sturdy or else it would shatter.”</p><p>Yuto places the glass he's clenching down, stretching out his fingers.</p><p>“Thought I’d check on you since you’re acting weird,” Inoo continues. “I’m worried about my friend, you know?”</p><p>Yuto doesn’t hear what Inoo said, looking past him instead. Crap. He lost them! He starts to panic for a few seconds before pausing, asking himself why he’s panicking. What does he care about Yuya? He barely knows anything about him. He's just someone he slept with exactly one night then got tossed aside, nothing more.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>“Alright!” Yuto says aloud, repeating to himself he shouldn’t care about someone like him.</p><p>“Okay!” Inoo pipes back cheerily. “See you later then!”</p><p>Before Yuto could ask what he said, Inoo is gone again.</p><p>Oh well.</p><p>After more people watching, he’s getting bored again when he catches a glimpse of Yuya walking alone, his own legs standing up without him telling them to. Maybe he doesn’t have anything to do with Yuya right now but…</p><p>Why not say hello? What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Yuto follows him, ending up at the bathroom. So the pretty man with him isn’t a toilet buddy. Noted. He waits about 10 seconds before heading in too, Yuya of course paying him no attention as he swings the door open. The music is slightly muffled in here, now aware of how loud his heart is pounding.</p><p>Despite that, he tries to play it cool, leaning his shoulder against the wall — hoping to dear God it’s clean — with crossed arms, pinpointing his energy into Yuya as he uses the urinal. When Yuya finishes, he barely glances at him, walking to the sink to wash his hands with soap.</p><p>At least he’s doing the bare minimum of cleanliness.</p><p>“Do you need something?” Yuya says after drying his hands. “Rude to blatantly stare at someone you don’t know while they’re pissing, isn’t it?”</p><p>Yuto bites his lip, Yuya’s attention on him whipping him across the face. His powerful aura is as captivating as the first time he spoke to him, filling up the entire small bathroom, trying to choke his lungs. But he sees the cautious eyes, squinting at him like a stranger and his question only confirms that Yuya doesn’t remember him, stabbing his gut. While Yuto himself had only heard one word when they bumped into each other earlier, the simple word enough to make him swoon.</p><p>Now hearing that rich voice speak whole sentences?</p><p><em> Ouch</em>.</p><p>“I’m hurt,” Yuto says, trying to keep steady as Yuya raises an eyebrow, looking him up and down.</p><p>“You look fine to me.”</p><p>He rolls his eyes. “I’m hurt you don’t remember me, an old colleague.” he clutches his chest dramatically.</p><p>The cogs move in Yuya’s head, racking his brain. “I don’t know you.”</p><p>He’s honest.</p><p>“Takaki Yuya.” Upon hearing his name, Yuya noticeably flinches. “University of Tokyo, you graduated 9 years ago while I was a first year,” he takes a step back when Yuya's eyes glance towards the door, presumably making an escape route. “Colleagues, not enemies,” he clarifies, trying to reassure him.</p><p>It bothers him Yuya doesn’t remember him, wanting it to come to his head naturally rather than straight up telling him the answer. Maybe there’s a better way to approach this, but his mind is too scattered over not having a plan of action, hoping the flow goes where he wants it to wherever that is.</p><p>And as they say, fake it till you make it.</p><p>Yuya nods slowly with a low hum. “We went to the same college? I don’t remember having any classes with you.” He tilts his head. “I think I would have remembered someone as handsome as you,” he murmurs.</p><p><em> Handsome</em>.</p><p>The last sentence rings in his ears, igniting a small flame in his chest, exciting him. Before answering, he licks his dry lips and swallows a few times, wondering if he’s imagining Yuya’s eyes watching his every movement. “We didn’t.”</p><p>“Oh? Then how do you know me?”</p><p>Despite there being a ton of people at their university, it’d be surprising if someone didn’t know who Takaki Yuya was.</p><p>But Yuto's patience is already running thin with this small talk, only going in circles. He has to be bolder.</p><p>Yuto sighs heavily, walking towards the other man, a curious look in Yuya’s eyes. “Does this–” he wraps an arm around Yuya’s shoulder and uses the other to grab his collar, pulling his face in close, taking notes of his now widened eyes at being caught off guard. “Ring a bell?”</p><p>He only meant to bring their faces in so Yuya can get a good close up. But now feeling his hot breath on him and the flicker of recognition in his eyes as they lower to examine his face with a lick of lips, he couldn’t resist tilting his head and leaning in. There's only a ghosting of lips when Yuya pushes him away, Yuto expecting to get punched.</p><p>But instead, it becomes his turn to get surprised when a strong hand pulls his head back in, lips smashing into each other. He can barely register what's happening as his head gets yanked back just as fast as it started, mind spinning along with his breath taken away, a small “oh” leaving his lips. Just that contact made heat rush throughout his entire body, heart pumping and stomach flipping.</p><p>“Hmm,” Yuya smirks, expression much different, more confident than a minute ago. “Now I remember, handsome boy.” Dark eyes pierce through him. “Nakajima, right?”</p><p>The low voice and his name leaving those luscious lips sends a jolt of electricity through him, leaving him in a daze. But Yuto’s lips twitch into a smug smile, something sparking in him that all Yuya needed was a kiss to remember him. “Oh, so you <em> do </em> remember.”</p><p>Yuya reaches up, cupping his chin and running his thumb along his upper lip. “Only you had this stimulating scar on your lip, made kissing you interesting. I didn’t see it until now.”</p><p>Yuto bites back a grin at how he stood out among all the people he’s been with, especially after all these years, thanking the scar he got when he was young. His eyes fall back onto Yuya’s lips, about to lean in and kiss him again but Yuya lets him go, taking a step back and fixing his collar. Yuto pouts, but he remembers Yuya didn’t seem like he came here alone — the man that was attached to his hip casually touching and laughing with him.</p><p>His hands unconsciously ball up into fists.</p><p>“So?” Yuya says. “You found me, Nakajima. Now what?”</p><p>Yuto didn’t think this far, still somewhat dazed from their kiss. “Just thought I’d say hi.”</p><p>“People usually say that to people they were close to,” Yuya raises an eyebrow. “But I must say, you’ve got an entertaining way to say hello, don’t you?” A tongue darts out to wet his lips to emphasize.</p><p>“First and second impressions last, don’t they?” Yuto gives him a sly smile.</p><p>Yuya chuckles, the deep sound warming up Yuto’s chest. “They sure do.”</p><p>"So, finally got yourself a boyfriend, huh?" Yuto says, getting straight to the point. “I’m impressed." he slowly claps.</p><p>Yuya frowns, cocking his head. "Boyfriend? What boyfriend?”</p><p>“The short brown haired one.”</p><p>“Ah, nah,” he denies instantly with a wave. “He’s a friend.”</p><p>The image of the other man touching Yuya’s arm gives him a shiver. “Didn’t seem like you two were just friends.”</p><p>“He’s tipsy and one of those needy types.”</p><p>“And how do you–”</p><p>“Besides,” Yuya interrupts, shoving a hand inside his pocket and shifting his weight to one leg, bangs falling across his face. “Screw dating, it's no fun."</p><p>Yuto scoffs, "Haven't changed since college, huh?"</p><p>Still fucking sexy as ever. Maybe even more so.</p><p>“Maybe I have, maybe not,” he says, eyes dropping downwards. “Your shirt button is loose,” he comments.</p><p>“Oh, is it?” Yuto feigns disinterest. “Wanna fix that for me?”</p><p>Yuya walks over slowly, each step increasing Yuto’s heart rate. His hand raises, pausing over Yuto’s shirt collar. He hums, ghosting his fingers along his chest, Yuto holding his breath.</p><p>“Fix?” Yuya pops open another button. “What, like this?”</p><p>Yuto sucks on his bottom lip, eyes meeting Yuya’s dark pair, close, too close. His breath quickens as Yuya’s hand slips into his shirt, flinching as the warmth follows his collarbone, dragging his palm down against his chest.</p><p>“You’re getting closer.” Yuto takes hold of Yuya’s wrist before he can pull away, lowering it to his hip.</p><p>"Oh yeah?" Yuya says in a deeper voice, bitter chocolate to his ears. The hand moves to his ass without assistance, giving him a squeeze. "Better?"</p><p>Yuto hums as Yuya's hand massages his ass. "Could use a little more–"</p><p>He doesn't get to finish his sentence because he gets pulled into the closest stall, face grabbed and lips smashing against his in a hot, messy kiss.</p><p>Oh, holy shit.</p><p>In just moments, Yuto becomes putty held up against the wall, letting Yuya take control of the kiss. A soft moan escapes his throat when a tongue pries open his mouth to deepen it, heat suffocating him. He tangles his hands into Yuya's long, beautiful hair — <em> finally </em>— to pull his face in closer, trying to satiate the deep hunger for Yuya that had lay dormant all these years and is now blossoming within his belly. It’s silky smooth against his fingers, wanting to bury his face into it if it weren't for his mouth being busy at the moment, struggling to focus on both the hot kiss and sleek hair at the same time.</p><p>But it doesn't last much longer, Yuya pulling back to attach his mouth onto Yuto’s neck, nipping at sensitive spots and making him bite back a groan, throwing his head back against the wall, faintly echoing. Hands roam under his shirt, each touch and scratch getting him hotter, more aroused, the attack of sensations driving him into a corner.</p><p>Yuya presses a knee into his crotch, Yuto hissing at the pressure against his growing erection. “You’re hard already?” Yuya says, amused as Yuto grinds against his knee. “How much do you want me? Go on, tell me.”</p><p>“Too much, now hurry the fuck up,” Yuto growls.</p><p>Yuya’s eyes widen slightly before narrowing. “If you say so.” He yanks down Yuto’s pants and underwear in one go, groping his ass with both hands before circling a finger around his rim, slightly pulling the skin. “You get fucked lately?”</p><p>The dry touch on his hole makes him tense, clenching as Yuya pokes and wiggles his finger at it. Yet it turns him on, erection swelling in anticipation. “It’s been awhile,” Yuto admits, having only been seeing Inoo who prefers to bottom more often than top.</p><p>Yuya hums, raising his hand and shoving two fingers into Yuto’s mouth. "Suck." Yuto does what he’s told, giving a little show as he licks over those fingers to coat them in saliva, wrapping his lips around them and bobbing his head slightly. Soon, Yuya pulls them out, directing them back to his ass, pushing in two at once. The stretching is far from gentle, rushed and scissoring him open with his makeshift lube as if they have no time. Yuto cries out from the burn, clutching Yuya’s back. “Shh, Nakajima. Don’t moan loud enough for everyone at the club to hear,” he chuckles.</p><p>“As if anyone can hear with how loud the– ah, music is,” Yuto rolls his eyes, grinding his ass back onto those fingers, preparing himself for more. He would've liked to touch himself, desperate for friction, but his arms need to be around Yuya to hold himself up or he'll crumble apart.</p><p>As Yuto’s discomfort turns into breathy moans, Yuya leans close to his ear with a hoarse whisper, “Reach into my pocket.” Yuto almost doesn’t understand what he said, too lost in the fingers inside him before reaching down, whistling at a travel sized bottle of lube.</p><p>“You come prepared, don’t you? Could’ve used this with your fingers.”</p><p>“Oops.” Yuya twists his fingers. “I come whenever I want,” he sticks the tip of his tongue out, Yuto wanting to bite it. “I have a condom too if you want? I get tested frequently.”</p><p>Yuto shakes his head. “I’m clean, I want to feel you inside me.”</p><p>“Okay, lube me up while I–” he thrusts his fingers in hard, making Yuto gasp. “Finish my work.”</p><p>Yuto fumbles with the cap, blushing at the snicker from the older. Once he gets it open he pulls Yuya's pants down just enough, exhaling as his erection springs out. “Oh, you’re bigger than I remember,” he comments, pouring lube onto his hand and wrapping it around him, slowly pumping the impossibly hot, hard yet silky flesh, encouraged by Yuya groaning lowly in his ear, nibbling on his lobe.</p><p>“Wait until it’s inside your ass.”</p><p>“Can’t fucking wait.”</p><p>Even though he wants to continue touching him, he craves it inside him more. Yuto whines as Yuya removes his fingers, wiping them onto Yuto’s thigh while grabbing and shifting his legs into a better position, pressing his tip against his hole.</p><p>“Fuck,” Yuto hisses when Yuya doesn’t give him warning before pushing in, slowly filling him up. His cock is far thicker than his fingers and he’s grateful for the lube helping, but it still burns, feeling the sharp stretch. “God damn, you really are big.”</p><p>“You love it,” Yuya smirks, “You’re so tight yet so willing to take me allll in, you’re so good at this.” he pulls back to the tip and thrusts all the way in, making Yuto cry out.</p><p>“Oh– fuck,” Yuto can’t control his moans, Yuya immediately setting a quick pace, a rhythm that has him curling his toes. “Keep– keep fucking me.”</p><p>“You're the one who hasn't changed, Nakajima.” Yuya bites his shoulder, making him moan. “You like it here, don’t you?” he licks his skin to soothe the bite.</p><p>Yuto clicks his tongue, “I've had better.”</p><p>God, he fucking loves it.</p><p>Either Yuto has forgotten how good it feels to have a real cock in him that's not a toy or it’s because it’s Yuya’s cock ramming into him, but his orgasm spreads like wildfire in his stomach sooner than he expects, leaving him gasping for breath.</p><p>Or maybe it’s a combination.</p><p>He wills himself to last longer, almost glad Yuya isn’t paying attention to his cock freely bouncing with each thrust, hands gripping his hips so hard he’s sure there’ll be bruises tomorrow.</p><p>“Your ass is so good squeezing around me,” Yuya groans in his ear, voice nearly making Yuto come spontaneously. “I’m going to come inside your nice ass.”</p><p>He just grunts, jaw dropping open in a silent scream with Yuya’s speeding thrusts. Yuto tenses as warm liquid fills him, Yuya stilling with a few slow, hard thrusts, riding out his orgasm. Once he’s finished, he pulls out, grinning at Yuto's whine from the emptiness, leaving him on the edge of his own orgasm. He loves how Yuya gaped him, clenching over air and his come, but he glares at him for not finishing him off.</p><p>"You shit.”</p><p>Yuya laughs. “What, you want to come too?”</p><p>“If you think I don’t then–”</p><p>"Go on then,” Yuya says smoothly. “Touch yourself. I want to see you make yourself come after being fucked by my dick."</p><p>Yuto doesn't think twice, hand wrapping around himself and stroking quickly. Just that voice alone telling him what to do is enough for him to start moaning. He wishes he still had his cock in him, but feeling his come dripping down his thigh and Yuya's glossy sex satisfied eyes on him were enough to throw himself over the edge, coming harder than he has in a while.</p><p>Thinking about it, that's exactly how he felt when he first slept with him years ago.</p><p>“Holy shit, that was… good,” Yuto mumbles, in a state of ecstasy.</p><p>As Yuto catches his breath, something soft wipes across his sensitive cock, stomach, and thigh, vaguely recognizing Yuya is cleaning up the mess they made on him. Yuto thinks he also helped. When they both get their clothes back together they leave the stall, washing up at the sink.</p><p>“Thanks for the sex, Nakajima Yuto,” Yuya raises his hand as he heads towards the exit. “Maybe we’ll meet again someday.”</p><p>Yuya leaves the bathroom, leaving Yuto gripping the edge of the sink to stay standing.</p><p>What just <em> happened</em>?</p><p>It was like college. Yuya fucking him then leaving. Yuto fell for it again. Despite the nice orgasm, his body feels prickly, Yuya’s sharp thorns stabbing him from within. Yuya’s warmth all over and in him is still fresh in his mind, but quickly cooling and legs shaking.</p><p>Taking a few minutes to gather up his strength, he stumbles out the bathroom, the loud music and crowd only making him dizzier.</p><p>"Yuto!”</p><p>Yuto’s head snaps towards the voice. “Inoo-chan?” he says when the mushroom approaches him, worry written on his face.</p><p>“Where have you been? You didn’t answer my calls! I thought you got drugged and kidnapped or something.”</p><p>“Ah, I’m sorry!” Yuto takes his phone out to see missed calls and messages from Inoo. “Really, I’m sorry, Inoo-chan. I was just– just in the bathroom,” he awkwardly points behind him.</p><p>Not a lie.</p><p>Inoo’s expression changes. “You… seem more out of it than before,” he frowns. “Are you sure you’re okay? Do you need me to call you a ride home?”</p><p>Damn Inoo’s observation abilities.</p><p>“I’m fine, I promise! I can even run a mile,” Yuto tries to reassure him, flexing an arm and slapping his bicep.</p><p>Inoo squints at him, “Do you wanna leave and fuck?”</p><p>Yuto laughs with that being the solution. "Not tonight, a bit too tired."</p><p>Having just orgasmed, he’s too spent for another round. And being honest, he wants to relish the way Yuya’s body felt against him, not wanting his recent memories of the night to get written over by sex with Inoo.</p><p>Not that Inoo isn’t a good fuck but… Yuya.</p><p>“See, you can’t run a mile after all!” Inoo calls him out with puffed out cheeks, Yuto giving him a tee hee pose. “Did you run into a drunk person… and…” Inoo’s voice trails off, mouth stuck opened. “Ohhh.”</p><p>Yuto purses his lips at his tone, the one when he realizes something. “What?”</p><p>“Ohhhhhhhhhh,” Inoo mischievously grins.</p><p>“Inoo-chan what are you–”</p><p>“Who did you just fuck?”</p><p>Yuto tenses. “Huh?”</p><p>“Who did you just fuck?” he repeats, nudging him with his elbow. “That’s why you don’t want to fuck me right now, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I didn’t fuck anyone,” Yuto flusters. “I don’t know what you’re–”</p><p>“You have two hickeys.” Yuto’s eyes widen as Inoo points to his neck. “And last time I checked, you didn’t have them an hour ago and<em> I </em> didn’t put them there.”</p><p>Yuto covers his neck with his hands, whispering, “Are you serious?” duh, Yuya was biting and kissing his neck, how could he not realize! He was too focused on the pleasure from it…</p><p>“Must've had a great time,” Inoo winks. “I can help you cover them up with makeup if you don’t want them to be seen.”</p><p>“I’ll deal with it tomorrow,” he sighs, a warm blush rising up his cheeks.</p><p>Inoo hits his palm with a fist, “Did you have your eye on someone and that’s why you were out of it?”</p><p>Yuto scratches the back of his neck. “Kind of?"</p><p>“And you two met?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Yuto couldn't hold back a smile, a rush of pride that Yuya remembers him after all these years overcoming him.</p><p>This is <em> great</em>!</p><p>“Wooo!” Inoo cheers. “You have a sex life other than me!” Before Yuto could retort, Inoo continues, “I promised you a second drink so let’s celebrate!”</p><p>The mushroom was already bouncing away towards the bar, Yuto rolling his eyes as he follows him for his free drink.</p><p>“Thanks, Inoo-chan.”</p><p>Inoo grins, toasting their drinks together. “You are sexy welcome!”</p><p>Inoo probably thought Yuto was thanking him for the drink, which of course he is, but he’s also thanking him for dragging him here in the first place, glad he decided to come (in more ways than one).</p><p>Yuto feels somewhat annoyed Yuya marked him like this without asking first.</p><p>Yet at the same time…</p><p>It makes him a little excited.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>Large gentle hands flutter over his skin. Caressing him. Floating in a bubble. High above the ground on soft, fluffy clouds. He reaches out to touch the hands back, but only waves through soft flowers. Through lovely, purple bloomerang lilacs swaying gently in the wind along with his body. Opening his mouth only fills him with a smoky tang coupled with a sickly sweet undertone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s not bad. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He could stay here forever. In this comfort. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Reminds him of… </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Of… </em>
</p><p>
  <em> … </em>
</p><p>Yuto sits up in his bed in a cold sweat, clutching his rapidly moving chest. He tries to make sense of his dream, remembering that something was chasing him and then… and then… it was already fading away from his grasp. He checks his phone, momentarily blinding him yet relieving him when it reads 5 AM, giving him a few extra hours to sleep. He tosses his phone to the side, pulling warm sheets over him, sighing with a smile.</p><p>Best feeling ever.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Yuto becomes lost in his own thoughts more often during the next week. He has these moments quite often, struggling to concentrate on details, making simple mistakes he’s spent years training for, not giving his 110% best. And it all shows — getting frustrated in his results, wanting to delete and change everything. People always tell him how amazing his photos come out, even now, but he still kicks himself, knowing full well he could do better, needing to be perfect.</p><p>Things keep distracting him. A buzz in the distance, someone tapping their foot, mind wandering off into nothingness. After catching himself zoning out a third time, he smacks his own cheeks, trying to get himself to focus.</p><p>Maybe he just needs some fresh air to clear his head with nature. Spring has barely begun, air still chilly but not too bleak with flowers and trees beginning to bud everywhere you look, adding some color and life. He's oddly more attracted to them than usual. With newfound energy, he darts around the nearby vicinity, trying to find something to photograph to not leave empty handed.</p><p>Yet, none of the flowers particularly stand out to him, not the ones he's looking for. The sky is clear, no clouds making interesting patterns. The sun isn’t in the right spot, shadows boring and still.</p><p>He's about to give up, when someone with dark shoulder length hair walks past him. His heart spikes, whipping his head back, hand reaching out to grab onto their shoulder.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Yuto had pulled his hand away before the voice reached his ears, realizing the shoulder wasn’t who he was expecting.</p><p>Expecting…?</p><p>“I’m sorry!” Yuto bows to a 90 degree angle. “I– I thought you were someone I knew,” he says sheepishly without raising his head.</p><p>Yuto wonders if he could dig a hole big enough in the spot next to him and hide there forever in embarrassment.</p><p>“It’s cool,” the voice says in a slightly high pitch.</p><p>Once he rises up, he’s frankly shocked at himself, the stranger looking absolutely nothing like… him. The hair length might be there, but it seems somewhat damaged, wondering if he uses the wrong hair products. He does not want to run his fingers through it.</p><p>Yet, it still gets his fingers twitching, sparking newfound ideas of photos in his head.</p><p>“Um, if you have time,” Yuto flusters, raising up his camera. “Can I take photos of you?”</p><p>When he finishes taking his photos he thanks the man, heading back to his computer to pick out the ones he likes. Clicking through them, he feels pretty good, relieved he found his inspiration.</p><p>But there's something off about them, something that seems wrong.</p><p>Maybe it’s his insecurity speaking again.</p><p>He adores the ones where the man faces away from the lens, showing off his frame best. They give him butterflies, makes his stomach all hot, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. He could imagine a different head on the body, wondering how much better the photos could be with someone else more sexy posing for him. His mind wanders in whole new directions, editing the photo to be more mysterious, more captivating.</p><p>Like… Him…</p><p>Yuto shakes his head. He loves being able to imagine in this field of work.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>He just keeps appearing in his mind. No matter what Yuto does to try to convince himself he’s not thinking of him, he can’t get Takaki Yuya out of his mind. The problem Yuto has is he only thinks about Yuya sexually, only wanting to undress him and feel his warm skin against his. All he cares about is his dick.</p><p>And Yuto has no idea what to do.</p><p>“Wanna release some tension and fuck?”</p><p>Yuto was zoned out when Inoo places a hand on his thigh, only reminding him of how Yuya had grabbed him there. He's supposed to be playing games with Inoo not thinking of Yuya! “I don’t know if I’m feeling it,” Yuto sighs, wanting to scream into the void, wishing the pleasure would just come to him without any effort to cure his sexual frustrations.</p><p>He pinches the bridge of his nose. It’s been years since he’s thought about Yuya and suddenly he’s all up in every nook and cranny of his mind as if he’s back in his horny-about-everything phase. All they did was have sex once — well, twice now — so why is Yuto overreacting over a guy he barely knows anything about?</p><p>"Even if you just lie there and I do all the work?" Inoo says seductively, tracing a finger down his chest.</p><p>Yuto holds back a laugh. Damn, he's good at reading minds. Well, since he’s being flooded with thoughts of sex with Yuya, he can’t deny he would like a distraction, a release of pent up sexual frustration.</p><p>"Sure, could use a nice view."</p><p>Even if it isn’t Takaki Yuya causing his release.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Hey pretty boy, you look lonely.”</p><p>Yuto winces as a woman he doesn’t know sits next to him. “I’m not interested.”</p><p>He does his best to get her off him, completely disinterested. Eventually after ignoring her enough, she walks off to probably another guy and Yuto couldn’t care less. He swirls the drink in his hand, ice melted and now at room temperature.</p><p>Why is he here again?</p><p>He had finished work and was on his way home, yet instead of being at his own door he found himself at the club Inoo had brought him to the other week. He told himself he’ll just pop in for a little bit, check out what music is playing and people watch with a single drink before heading out.</p><p>Just for research purposes.</p><p>No big deal.</p><p>He still has his one drink to finish.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next night, Yuto finds himself at the club again, telling himself the exact same thing. Just for a little bit with a single drink. And the next night. And the next. When he reaches the point of not remembering how many nights it’s been as they blend together, he wouldn’t be surprised if the bartender realized he keeps returning every night with no one and leaving with no one. He considered bringing Inoo along but he’ll be too suspicious as to why he's here considering he usually has to beg Yuto to come clubbing with him.</p><p>Is he that desperate?</p><p>Yuto lets out a frustrated sigh, ruffling his hair and vowing this is the last night he’s going to come here. This has been a whole waste of time. He stands to leave, bumping into someone after one step.</p><p>“Ah, sorry,” Yuto waves off, just wanting to leave as soon as he possible to get right into bed and watch a movie or two.</p><p>But a hand catches his wrist, pulling him to face a devious smile. “Hi. On your way somewhere?”</p><p>Yuto’s eyes widen. “Oh,” was all he could come up with in a high pitched voice. “Takaki,” he breathes out.</p><p>Maybe coming here wasn’t a waste of time after all.</p><p>Yuya lets him go. “Nakajima.” the way he says his name does <em> something </em> to him. “Surprised to see you here again. Alone?” he looks around.</p><p>“What a coincidence!” Yuto tries to pull off cooly. “Yeah, I’m alone tonight.” He looks past Yuya’s shoulders. “You too?” hopefully the hope in his voice didn’t show.</p><p>Yuya tilts his head slightly. “I <em> was </em> alone.”</p><p>“Was?” he repeats with a slight choke.</p><p>“And now you’re here,” Yuya says smoothly, pushing his shoulder to make him sit back down and taking a seat across from him. “So keep me company, yeah?” the corners of his lips rise in a small smile.</p><p>“Sure,” Yuto says, a bit dazed finding himself sitting.</p><p>They have some catch up talk, mentioning college and current work. But Yuto couldn't stay too interested, getting bored as other thoughts swirl and take over his mind. He could only examine his face, amazed at how attractive he is as he outlines his jaw and nose lines. He thinks about the other night he met him here, how hot and hard he was fucking him.</p><p>“Are you even listening to me?”</p><p>Yuto blinks, tapping on the table. “Hey, Takaki,” he ignores his question. “You still just leave everyone you fuck?”</p><p>“You make me sound heartless.” he clutches his chest.</p><p>“Answer the question.”</p><p>“Okay okay,” he raises his hands in defense. “What if I do? Relationships aren’t fun staying with only one or two people.”</p><p>“So I’m just another guy you fucked and left, huh?” Yuto rolls his eyes, but he can’t be that upset over it.</p><p>Even if it happened twice.</p><p>“Yeah.” The no hesitation made Yuto want to punch him. “But…” Yuya continues, “I have to admit, you're a pretty good fuck.”</p><p>“Oh?” he leans forward on both elbows. “I’m that special?”</p><p>“Guess so,” he shrugs. “It’s not often a name sticks to me.”</p><p>Yuto bites his bottom lip, wanting to be more special to Yuya, make him keep remembering him so he doesn’t forget again.</p><p>“Ever since we met that night,” Yuto says slowly. “I can’t get you out of my head.”</p><p>That piques his interest. “Oh, really? Go on.”</p><p>Yuto licks his lips. “I can’t stop thinking about how fucking good your cock feels in my ass.”</p><p>And how great it was to come from it.</p><p>“Straight to the point. I like that,” he nods approvingly. “What was good about it?”</p><p>“Everything, of course,” he answers without pause. “Toys can’t compare to the girth of you stretching me wide open.”</p><p>Yuya’s eyes lower slightly, staring for a moment before responding, “You have such a dirty mouth, Nakajima.”</p><p>Was Yuya imagining him using his toys alone, desperately trying to get off while wishing Yuya’s cock was inside him instead? Yuto was. The thought of it now starts him up, pulling at his abdomen, wanting to build Yuya up, make him feel hot too.</p><p>“I bet you my mouth can get far dirtier, Takaki,” Yuto comments, opening his mouth and sticking his tongue out, trying not to look proud when Yuya’s eyes darken.</p><p>“Are you asking to get fucked again?”</p><p>“By you.”</p><p>“By me.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Sounds like an interesting idea, Nakajima.” he licks his lips. “I’m a pretty busy man but maybe I could get behind fucking you a few more times.”</p><p>“I'd love you behind me,” he provokes. “It won’t take long if it’s your dick, that’s all I’m asking for. Just sex, no other relationship.”</p><p>He only sees Yuya sexually. That's all. Tonight proved that he didn't care about having a conversation or small talk, only thinking about how much he wants his cock, how much he wants his body.</p><p>Yuya hums, raising an eyebrow. “Like a fuck and dash kinda deal? Nothing serious? I've had people try that before and change their minds." he makes a face.</p><p>"Nope. Not interested. At all. It's hard for me to get attached to people since I prefer to be alone," he elaborates. "I even got out of group projects."</p><p>Yuya raises an eyebrow, thinking about his offer. "And yet you want to meet me?"</p><p>He nods. "You already leave feelings behind so it'll be hard for either of us to get attached, right?" Yuya slowly nods. Yuto grins, having his full attention. <em> Perfect</em>. “So what do you say? Let’s have some fun, you and me,” he says seductively. “Just fuck around, that’s it. It’ll be a win-win for both of us.”</p><p>Yuya whistles, running a hand through his hair. “Can’t say no to such a blatant request… you wanna fuck me that bad?”</p><p>He thinks about how he’s been waiting here for him every night, how he’s been in his mind ever since. “Yeah.”</p><p>“I suppose I can set aside some time for you,” Yuya says. “Well, only because you’re so willing.” He stands up, “Then, since you want me so badly,” he walks towards him, leaning down to his ear. “Come to a love hotel with me,” he whispers, sending a shiver down Yuto’s spine.</p><p>“Hotel? Now?” Yuto asks breathily.</p><p>“This is what you asked for, right?” Yuya raises an eyebrow. “Unless you wanna fuck in the bathroom again?”</p><p>“Hotel is fine.” Yuto stands up a little too fast, head spinning.</p><p>“Good boy.”</p><p>Yuto follows him to the closest love hotel, pushing away the thought of how Yuya could find his way directly to it without needing directions. He’s shocked yet excited he’s doing this, so easily convincing Yuya.</p><p>But anything as long as he can get fucked by Takaki Yuya.</p><p>After that, they discuss ground rules and expectations for their casual sexual relationship. They agree they don't want anything serious with each other, sticking strictly to sex and limiting their time together to keep intimacy levels low. They also agree it's okay to sleep with other people, granted they get tested for STIs often.</p><p>Yuto doesn’t know if he’s frustrated at himself for seeking Yuya out just for sex, uncharacteristic of him. He slept with him <em> thrice </em> for God’s sake. He’s always been more reserved, taking time to get to know someone before even befriending them.</p><p>But he can’t help himself. Yuto’s body craves Yuya in ways he can’t explain, never having felt this much desire for someone. Yuya's touch and scent became a drug to him, addicted to the rush of adrenaline he gets when he inhales his intoxicating scent, heart pumping hot blood through his veins and scrambling up his thoughts in pure ecstasy. It fills him up with a burning fire trapped within his body that only Yuya can help to untangle his sturdy vines and release the heat and his orgasm.</p><p>It’s the only thing he wants from him. And it’s the only thing Yuya wants from him. It's mutual. There aren’t any strings attached, making talking to him easy since they only talk about what they like and don't like during sex, only worrying about that and themselves.</p><p>And here he is again at the same love hotel just a couple nights later, back arching while Yuya pins him down, cock in his ass and fucking away his soul high into the crevices of oblivion.</p><p> </p><p>Something bud-like in Yuto’s chest twitches.</p>

  <p>A few times turns into several times, losing count of their meetings over the next month. As expected, they keep to themselves other than talking about sex, simply enjoying the touch of each other’s bodies. Sweet nothings are said, only to be forgotten immediately afterwards. It’s thrilling, so easy to walk away once they get what they want, never staying nights together, restricting unnecessary touching like cuddling or romantic gestures.</p><p>They have busy lives after all.</p><p>“You’re here again?” Yuya says, amused at seeing Yuto at the club for the second time this week. “I’ve been coming to this club for months before meeting you and suddenly I’m seeing you everywhere.”</p><p>“I’ve taken a liking to here,” Yuto smiles innocently, wondering – hoping for – when Yuya would come. “What are you doing later? Wanna fuck?” he gets straight to the point. On occasion they'll have a few drinks together to loosen themselves up, but Yuto wasn't having it this time, just wanting to get Yuya in and out.</p><p>Yuya opens his mouth to answer when someone appears by his side.</p><p>“There you are!”</p><p>Yuto stares at the baby-faced man as Yuya apologizes to him. “How did you get in here?” he blurts out, the two other men exchanging a glance before laughing.</p><p>“I'll have you know, I’m 31,” the man crosses his arms.</p><p>His mouth drops open. “Eh? You’re <em> older </em> than me?”</p><p>“A friend or?” the man jerks his thumb at Yuto.</p><p>“Not really," Yuya shrugs. “Same college. That’s all.”</p><p>“Ah I see.” He turns to Yuto, covering his mouth from Yuya. “I heard this man was wild in college," he nudges him.</p><p>“Arioka,” Yuya warns.</p><p>“I’m just playing around,” ‘Arioka’ pouts. “Anyways, let’s get outta here.”</p><p>Yuya nods, turning back to Yuto. “Well there’s your answer, Nakajima. I’ve got a date tonight. See you.”</p><p>Date? <em> Date</em>? Like, boyfriend date or fuck date? He thought they both said they’re single!</p><p>Yuto closes his jaw as they walk away, hearing them laugh over something. He had gotten too flustered to speak, annoyed with how he took Yuya away from him. Does Yuya call everyone a date? Does he tell his friends he’s going on a date when he’s meeting up with Yuto?</p><p>His lips tighten into a line at that thought. “Same college, that’s all,” he mumbles to himself.</p><p>But it isn't like they have much of a relationship anyways.</p><p>He leaves the club right away, having no need to stay. At home, he’s frustrated emotionally and sexually, wishing Yuya was here with him. He knows they agreed they could still sleep with other people, but is that Arioka guy really a better fuck than Yuto is? He could just masturbate, but he was so ready to have a human body’s warmth on him since seeing Yuya.</p><p>And that all got ruined.</p><p>So Yuto calls his only friend, Inoo, over to blow off some steam. If Yuya is fucking someone else, he can play that game too. To his relief, Inoo pipes back a cheerful “yeah sure! The night is young!” It had been awhile since he and Inoo had sex, having been spending more time with Yuya instead.</p><p>He feels kind of bad.</p><p>But despite Yuto’s sexual frustration, he’s unable to stay hard, only getting more frustrated.</p><p>“Hey,” Inoo says gently, placing a soft hand on his thigh when Yuto slips out with a sigh, cock flaccid. “We can stop.”</p><p>“I know,” Yuto scrunches his face. “I’m just… I don’t know.” he runs a hand through sweaty hair. “I feel all over the place.”</p><p>“Wanna talk about it rather than try to fuck it away?” his friend smiles warmly.</p><p>Yuto doesn’t know how he got so lucky to have such a friend. “After we clean up, I’m way too sweaty.”</p><p>
  <span>Afterwards, they sit on Yuto’s bed, Yuto feeling awkward since just a few minutes ago they were naked and horny. Inoo had tried prying information about Yuya before but Yuto didn’t budge, keeping their sexual relationship on the down low. He didn’t expect to meet with him this often.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>”Do you remember when I was in college and I told you about that ridiculously hot older fuckboy on campus during my first year?” Yuto starts off.</span>
</p><p>They didn’t attend the same college but they weren’t shy in telling each other about any hot men they encountered.</p><p>Inoo nods slowly. “The one with disappearing eyes when he smiled or the one with the long, luscious hair? Oh, or the one who shone like a star while playing bass?”</p><p>“... Long hair.” Yuto cocks his head, realizing there were a surprising number of hot guys at his campus. “I think the other two got together once they graduated.”</p><p>“Good for them.” Inoo claps. “You did always like the older ones.”</p><p>“Don’t say it like–”</p><p>“Okay so, what about Mr. hair?” he leans in. “Don’t tell me that you magically somehow met him after all these years, remembered each other and are now fuck buddies.” Yuto blinks, staring at him blankly. “Oh my God, Yuto.” Inoo covers his mouth. "You let a past one night stand turn into more?!"</p><p>“It’s not as bad as you think!” Yuto waves his hands. “We just met a few times.”</p><p>A few times too many… maybe.</p><p>“Just sex?”</p><p>“Just sex,” Yuto admits. “We agreed no strings attached because he thinks staying with one person is boring.”</p><p>Inoo hums. “Is that good or bad?”</p><p>Yuto purses his lips. This is exactly what he wanted and he’s satisfied with it, but after seeing Yuya with that Arioka guy and the word ‘date’… and also that other pretty boy from the first night… “I don’t know.”</p><p>"Mhm," Inoo lets him continue.</p><p>
  <span>"I’m not interested in dating him though, he’s hot but too extroverted and exhausting,” Yuto waves his hands around. “All he does is run through my mind and make me all…” he wiggles his fingers. “Horny." he scrunches his nose. “Is it weird to only think of a person sexually?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inoo looks lost in thought. “Am I exhausting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Somewhat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nods. “Anyways, it’s fine to like him sexually, I do it a lot with my own hook-ups,” Inoo starts. “He is more than a walking dick though.”</span>
</p><p>“That’s exactly what I feel bad about!”</p><p>He puts his head into his hands, heart racing at the image of Yuya, at the thought of being fucked by him now that Inoo planted the thought of Yuya's cock, heavy between his legs. He should’ve been fucking him right now if it weren’t for that other guy. But they agreed they can fuck other people, hell he just tried fucking Inoo not long ago! He’s reminded of how Yuya always keeps a condom in his pocket, shuddering when he imagines him using it on someone else.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>"Yuto, are you catching feelings?"</p><p>Yuto blinks. Feelings? They agreed on not having feelings. "I don’t know anything about him, how would I even catch any feelings in the first place that doesn’t make sense,” he flails his arms. “I’m just attracted to his body.”</p><p>Inoo places a hand on his chin. “It's not like you to only be into sex," he murmurs. "It took forever to get you to even talk to me." he glances down, eying his crotch. "He makes you that horny?”</p><p>“Yes,” he says without hesitation.</p><p>“And you’re horny right now?”</p><p>Yuto looks down at his slight bulge in his pants, pulling his waistband forward to inspect. "...Yes."</p><p>“And you couldn’t meet with him tonight to fuck so you called me over?”</p><p>Yuto blushes at how he got him spot on, embarrassed at how shitty that makes him. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Ehhh. So then,” he leans in, squeezing his thigh. “What do you say about a take 2~?” He grins.</p><p>Yuto’s eyes widen. “Even after I just told you I’m thinking of another man?”</p><p>“Why should that matter to me? We’ll figure this out together after we take care of–” he presses his palm into Yuto's crotch, a soft groan leaving his lips. "This."</p><p>“Inoo-chan!” Yuto jumps forward, hugging him. “Are you sure that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“I’m your friend, right?”</p><p>Yuto squints at his mischievous face, knowing a plan is forming in his brain. “Okay. Let’s do this.”</p><p>He'll deal with it afterwards.</p><p>In the end, Yuto got to come.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Yuto's shaky finger hovers over the send button, heart racing in his chest. <em>You can do it</em>, he tells himself with a gulp. He's just about to tap it when he pulls away at the last second, lowering his phone. "I don't think I can do it, Inoo-chan. This is a terrible plan."</p><p>Inoo rolls his eyes, “You’re just asking him to go out for dinner, what’s so hard about that?” he pauses. “Other than you two afterwards.”</p><p>“Inoo-chan!” Yuto wails, alternating his fists on him. “That’s the problem, we agreed only sex how can I ask for dinner without seeming like a booty call? Isn't this like breaking rules?”</p><p>“Yeah but who cares about rules?"</p><p>Yuto makes a face. "I do. You’re the hookup master don’t you follow–"</p><p>"If he says no then he truly wants nothing more than your body," Inoo cuts him off. "And if he says yes, you need to figure out if you have feelings or not and communicate that to him right there," Inoo shrugs him off. "Just say this isn't a booty call.”</p><p>“That’s something someone asking for a booty call would do.”</p><p>“I–” Inoo cups his own chin. “So you can ask him for sex but you can’t ask for a simple dinner?”</p><p>Yuto furrows his brows. “Those two are very different things.”</p><p>“The point is– you know what? Here,” he holds out his hand. “I’ll send the text for you since you two will never have dinner together at this rate.”</p><p>Yuto tries dodging him by raising his arms over his head, Inoo crawling on top of his lap without hesitation in an attempt to grab his phone. “Inoo-chan– Inoo-chan wait–” The older man snatches the phone from him. “Inoo-chaaaaaan! But, but what if–”</p><p>“Too late.” Inoo shows him the screen, message already sent. “Oh wait, let me add the, ‘this is not a booty call’” he types as he says. "That way he'll know."</p><p>“Noooooo!” Yuto covers his ears and eyes.</p><p>“I don’t know how that’s going to help, Yuto.”</p><p>“So I can’t hear his response.”</p><p>“That’s stupid since you can hear me–”</p><p>“LALALALALAAAA~ WHAT DID YOU SAY?”</p><p>“I SAID THAT’S STU–” Yuto’s phone beeps. “Oh he responded–”</p><p>“What did he say?” Yuto snatches his phone back.</p><p>
  <em> Takaki Yuya: K </em>
</p><p>“‘K’?” Yuto cries out. “A fucking ‘K’? That’s it? What does ‘K’ mean?” he thrusts his phone into Inoo’s face who just laughs.</p><p>“It means you two are going out for dinner. Congrats, a huge milestone,” Inoo places his hands on Yuto's shoulders. “We’re getting you a nice outfit for your date.”</p><p>“Huh? What–”</p><p>“Yahoo! Let’s go!”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When the day of the fated dinner finally arrives, Yuto checks in the reserved restaurant 15 minutes earlier than expected. He's quite surprised Yuya said yes, considering they agreed to limit contact outside of sex, pretty sure this is a bad idea. It was an Inoo idea after all and Inoo's ideas tend to be terrible choices (though he can't say much about his own ideas). Yet despite his worries, he began to look forward to it, getting over excited like a bouncing bunny.</p><p>And now it’s finally happening! All it took was a single text! Who knew it was that easy to go out for dinner with someone!</p><p>There weren't many people here, so he's able to settle at a table, thanking the waiter for a complimentary bread basket, taking a piece and gnawing at it to relieve his anxiety, leg shaking beneath the table. It’s just a dinner, yet the thought of it being their <em> first </em>dinner together is getting him all riled up, running though his mental list of various topics he prepared several days ago so it doesn't get awkward. He even planned how to pass the conversation to Yuya's court, eager to hear more of Yuya’s beautiful voice.</p><p>But 10 minutes pass after their expected meeting time. Then another 10.</p><p>He shifts awkwardly in his seat as he explains to the waiter for the second time that he’s sure his expected guest will be here soon and that he wants to wait for him before ordering. His empty bread basket is replaced by a filled one, Yuto not missing the apologetic look as the waiter nods and walks away.</p><p>Did he get the wrong date? The wrong time? No, he was able to check in. Did Yuya forget? Was he with someone else?</p><p>Yuto checks his phone to try calling him again, but a presence makes him shiver, head snapping towards the entrance. Relief fills him as an out of breath Yuya speed walks towards him.</p><p>“Did you get lost–” Yuto starts to tease him when someone else appears next to Yuya.</p><p>“So, you’re Nakajima-kun?”</p><p>Yuto's heart drops.</p><p>It’s pretty boy.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late,” Yuya bows slightly in apology, still huffing. “I ran into Yamada — oh this is Yamada by the way, Yamada, Nakajima,” he waves his hand between them while pushing his hair away from his face, strands sticking to a thin layer of sweat. “Anyways, ran into him and he asked to join so I thought why not? That cool?”</p><p><em> Say no! </em> Yuto’s head screams. He could even hear Inoo screaming at him.</p><p>“Oh, that’s okay,” he says a bit faintly, forcing out a smile.</p><p><em> Damn it, Yuto</em>.</p><p>“I really wanted to meet you since Yuyan mentions you quite often,” Ryosuke says cheerily, also seeming somewhat out of breath. “I’m Yamada Ryosuke!” he holds out his hand for a handshake.</p><p><em> Yuyan</em>??</p><p>Yuto doesn't take his hand.</p><p>So much for having a nice, first dinner alone together with Yuya.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me join, but–” Ryosuke hugs Yuya’s arm. “Sorry you have to be the third wheel,” he says innocently.</p><p>Yuto tenses up, forcing out a laugh. He bites his lip, debating whether to keep his thoughts of <em>nah</em> <em>you’re the third wheel</em> to himself or not.</p><p>“Yama,” Yuya says warningly before switching to a softer tone, “Go sit,”</p><p>The smaller gives a small pout before obeying and taking a seat, giving Yuto a glance.</p><p>Was that a threatening glance or did he imagine that?</p><p>“Were you waiting long?” Yuya asks. “It took a bit to convince the staff I’m here for a reservation for two with a third person.”</p><p>Yuto is annoyed Yuya didn’t ask him first, the easy solution being to kick him out instead of arguing with staff. He directs his eyes towards the bread basket, full since he had just gotten it replaced before he arrived. “Not that long.” Yuya catches his gaze, a sigh of relief leaving his lips.</p><p>“Sweet.”</p><p>The waiter soon greets them, throwing Yuto a relieved look before taking their orders. Yuto thinks he would’ve felt awkward with only Yuya despite having prepared several conversation routes in his head, but with Ryosuke next to Yuya it makes him feel… weird. He doesn't know much about Yuya and knows even less about Ryosuke, unable to read his facial expressions.</p><p>Especially considering they likely sleep together, unable to keep the images of Ryosuke clinging onto Yuya’s arm out of his head, the older not pushing him off as if he’s used to it and doesn’t mind it.</p><p>Maybe even <em> likes </em> it.</p><p>“Hey, Yuyan,” Ryosuke faces Yuya as if Yuto wasn’t there. “Wanna help me grind for ranking tonight?”</p><p>“Tonight?” Yuya frowns. “But if we do, we'll end up playing games into the late hours and you have work early in the morning.”</p><p>“I’ve done it before and I can do it again,” he crosses his arms.</p><p>“Maybe for a bit then,” Yuya smiles at him.</p><p>“Eh? You play games?” Yuto pipes in, eyes on Yuya.</p><p>“Yeah! All the time!” Ryosuke answers. Before Yuto could say he’s not asking him, he continues, “Even if it’s 2 AM, Yuyan and I play games together,” he pauses, eyes narrowing and voice lowering. “Lots and lots of different games together,” he says suggestively with a smirk.</p><p>Yuto raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Yamada–” Yuya starts.</p><p>“What kind of games? That's late.” Yuto leans forward on his elbows. He’s pretty sure Ryosuke is baiting him but he takes it anyway, too curious.</p><p>Yuya glances at Yuto before looking at Ryosuke silently asking for permission from him. Yuya just sighs, giving him a “go ahead” wave.</p><p>“You know, online games, coops games,” Ryosuke says. “Even if we're meeting in person we’re playing them. But sometimes,” a corner of his mouth raises slightly. “Sometimes they get a little…” he tilts his head. “Physical.” Yuto’s eye twitches, opening his mouth to say something but Ryosuke interrupts him, “Like dance dance revolution! That one always gets me out of breath whew.” he pulls at his collar to fan himself. “Right, Yuyan?” he nudges him with his elbow.</p><p>“Right,” he responds, eyes on Ryosuke’s neck.</p><p>Yuto follows his line of sight, eyes widening at the red and purple marks littering his shiny with sweat collarbone. Did those come from…? Ryosuke catches Yuto’s gaze, grinning evilly for a split second then putting back on an innocent smile.</p><p>Yuto unconsciously fixes his own collar, sure he has his own marks from Yuya too. “Just what are you–”</p><p>“Oh! Our food is here!” Ryosuke grins, eyes glued onto Yuto's as their dishes are placed on their table.</p><p>“What were you going to say, Nakajima?” Yuya asks once the waiter leaves.</p><p>He grits his teeth, “Nothing.”</p><p>As they eat and have small talk, Yuto’s mind is spinning, streams of thoughts in and out of his head revolving around what Ryosuke has been saying, overthinking each and every word. What exactly is their relationship? Why did he want to meet him? It’s obvious now Ryosuke is purposefully messing with him to get under his skin and Yuto is pissed he’s falling for his dirty tricks.</p><p>But why is he doing it? And why is Yuto pissed at him?</p><p>Yuya places down his utensils. “Nakajima.”</p><p>The voice makes Yuto perk up, Yuya’s attention having mainly been on Ryosuke. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Come with me?” he stands, pointing his thumb in a direction.</p><p>“Should I–” Ryosuke starts but one look from Yuya stops him in his tracks, taking a sip of his drink with a pout.</p><p>Yuto raises an eyebrow but follows him anyway, chewing on his lip. Yuya doesn't explain as they end up in the bathroom, barely large enough to fit the two of them.</p><p>“So?” Yuto says.</p><p>“Don’t ‘so’ me,” Yuya crosses his arms. “You’re glaring.”</p><p>“What? Why would I be glaring?”</p><p>“That’s why I’m asking you.”</p><p>Yuto examines his face, pointing to the corner of Yuya’s mouth. “Well, you do have a bit of sauce on–”</p><p>“Not me,” Yuya says impatiently, Yuto yelping as a hand slams beside his head, pinning him to the wall. “Yamada.”</p><p>Yuto freezes in place, eyes wide. “Yamada?” he squeaks out once he realizes what he said.</p><p>“You’re glaring at Yamada.”</p><p>He furrows his brows, not realizing he was glaring at him. But he isn’t surprised. “Why do you care if I’m glaring at him? It’s not your problem.”</p><p>“Oh I don’t know,” Yuya tilts his head, hair falling over an eye. “Maybe because Yamada is my friend and if you don’t like him it’s my problem too?”</p><p>Yuto scoffs, “Friend? He’s <em> clearly </em> suggesting you two are more than friends.”</p><p>Yuya’s eyes narrow. “And what if we are?”</p><p>The question gets Yuto riled up, hands balling up into fists. “You two are fucking each other, correct?”</p><p>He doesn’t answer right away. "He's a good cock warmer," he shrugs. "Got a decent ass but some nice, soft thighs to hold onto."</p><p>Yuto clicks his tongue, grabbing Yuya’s face and smashing his lips against him. Yuya starts to complain but Yuto shuts him up, using the opportunity when he opens his mouth to shove his tongue in. He grins when Yuya groans into his mouth, Yuya grabbing the back of his head and kissing him harder.</p><p>It takes his breath away, fueling that sharp, red fire burning in his stomach wrapping around his insides. Yuya fills it with rolling passion, with lust and desire. It heats him up, hands wandering with fingers slipping under Yuya’s shirt to touch searing skin, vibrating to touch more and more.</p><p>Yuya hooks his fingers into Yuto’s belt loops, pulling his hips closer, groaning as they grind against each other. “Fuck, lube is in my, car,” Yuya mutters between kisses, not stopping his movements.</p><p>"You were planning on getting some tonight?" Yuto laughs breathily, the thought of being taken somewhere else after dinner to fuck arousing him further.</p><p>Not that he’s any different. Simple dinner his ass.</p><p>"I always keep some in my car, and besides," he leans in to kiss his jaw. "It wasn't just a plan," he kisses the corner of his mouth. "I got some before we met tonight." Yuto freezes, Yuya’s hands snaking around to cup his ass, giving it a squeeze. "Why do you think I was late, Nakajima?"</p><p>Yuto tenses up, Yuya’s dark eyes piercing into his. “You said it was because you had to convince the staff of having an extra person,” he says slowly, eyes widening halfway as he realizes how Yuya had rushed in the restaurant late, slightly sweaty and out of breath… and how he happened to be with Ryosuke. Who was in a similar condition. “You–!”</p><p>“You thought that would take long?” Yuya chuckles darkly, a grin on his face. “How cute.”</p><p>He grits his teeth, swearing to himself with bits of red anger as a cocky Ryosuke pops into his head, the fresh marks on his collarbone purposely shown to him howling in laughter at him, mocking him.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>Yuto growls, dropping to his knees and quickly unbuckling Yuya’s belt.</p><p>“Woah, easy there,” Yuya says, but immediately tangles his hand into Yuto’s hair as he takes his half hard cock into his mouth. “Eager, aren’t you?”</p><p>He hums in response, hollowing his cheeks and massaging his tongue all over his head. He wonders if Ryosuke’s mouth had been here not long ago, wanting to surpass that. He speeds up as Yuya hardens and grows in his mouth until he can’t fit him all inside, grazing the back of his throat, loving the weight and silkiness of his cock on his tongue and in his hands.</p><p>But he can’t take time to enjoy that right now, needing to make Yuya come as fast as possible, get him completely undone.</p><p>“That’s right, Nakajima,” Yuya coos, pulling his head in. “Let me come down your pretty throat.”</p><p>“Fuck yes.” That spurs Yuto on more, twisting his hands around him and massaging his balls, knowing Yuya's close with his sloppy thrusting and the way his cock throbs with leaking precome, cock so good filling up his mouth.</p><p>Now if he could just–</p><p>*<em>knock knock</em>*</p><p>“Uhhh you good in there?” a voice calls out.</p><p>The two turn towards the door then at each other saying in unison, “shit.”</p><p>Rushing to get Yuya’s pants back up, they leave the bathroom, doing the walk of shame as they awkwardly apologizing to the line of people waiting.</p><p>“Why does this whole restaurant have <em> one </em> fucking bathroom?” Yuya mutters.</p><p>Yuto silently curses for being interrupted, just needing a little more time and he could've had Yuya’s come for dessert. He heads towards their table when a vice grips his arm, spinning him around.</p><p>“I’m not done with you yet.”</p><p>The words chill Yuto’s spine, Yuya pulling him out of the restaurant to his car. The older opens the passenger side door for him, motioning him to enter. Yuto expects to be taken right there considering there's apparently lube here and Yuya was close to coming. But once in, Yuya gets behind the wheel, starting it up and driving out.</p><p>“I would fuck you now but my legs will cramp up and I’m not up for that again,” he explains as if reading his mind. “Don’t worry, my place isn’t far. You can be patient.”</p><p>Again? Yuto shakes his head.</p><p>The entire drive Yuto’s heart thumps in his chest, legs bouncing in anticipation. He resists the urge to touch himself, erection straining in his tight pants, wanting Yuya’s hand on him instead, wanting his cock in him. He eyes the bulge in Yuya’s pants, mouth salivating at the salty taste of him and his precome lingering on his tongue. It makes him a bit giddy knowing that must be uncomfortable for Yuya too, feels good that he's impatient, speeding along the road.</p><p>And that Yuto caused it all.</p><p>Once they get inside, Yuto doesn’t get any time to marvel at the place, finding himself on a bed with clothes off and hands and lips all over each other's bodies, desperately rushing to finish what they started. Yuto is completely hooked onto Yuya's body, starving for the pleasure that Yuya gives him. Before Yuto knows it, Yuya’s lubed up cock is in his ass, thrusting quickly, stealing his breath away.</p><p>“Ahh, Yuya!” Yuto gasps, his first name slipping out. Yuya only thrusts harder, making him cry out his name again.</p><p>“You’re all mine,” Yuya growls. “Your ass is mine, isn’t it?” he squeezes a cheek as he pounds into him. “Yuto.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Yuto agrees breathlessly, Yuya’s words digging out his orgasm with each thrust rubbing his erection against the sheets under him, giving him the friction he craves. “Yours.”</p><p>It’s not long before Yuya comes with a groan, roughly thrusting to ride out his orgasm. Yuto reaches his limit too soon after, gasping with each wave of pleasure radiating through his body. Just as Yuto is starting to come down from his high, Yuya pushes him off his cock, pulling his ass up and spreading his cheeks with a rough "Push" come dripping out while Yuto's heavy cock twitches and leaks between his legs, left to feel the aftershocks empty and without anything touching him. Fingers reach around, hooking into his mouth, recognizing the salty taste immediately as Yuya massages his tongue. Yuya gives a cheek a soft bite and a kiss before letting him go, Yuto's shaky legs giving in and collapsing, curling up in a sex satisfied state.</p><p>“Ooh that was good,“ Yuto mumbles, pleased.</p><p>Yuya doesn’t say anything, taking out his phone and clicking through, eyes widening at the screen. “Shit,” he mutters. “We forgot about Yamada.”</p><p>Yuto bites back a laugh, wondering if he saw them leave together, imagining his jaw dropping open after his whole show of making Yuya seem like his. <em> Good, forget about him</em>. “Surely he realized what was going on by now, right?”</p><p>He ignores him, typing away at his phone. Yuto watches as he stares intently at the screen, letting out a relieved sigh. “He found his way and has everything. Did you leave anything important?”</p><p>“I have everything,” Yuto rolls his eyes. “So then, how about we–”</p><p>“He asked if you want your leftovers?” Yuya says without looking at him. “He’s coming over tonight so you could stay until he does or I could drop them off to you later?”</p><p>The color drains from Yuto’s face. He’s meeting with Ryosuke <em> again</em>? <em>Tonight</em>?</p><p>“It’s fine,” Yuto says. “What if instead him I–”</p><p>“Oh and he said don’t worry about paying, he’s okay with taking the bill.” he makes a face as his phone blinks again. “That little…”</p><p>“Uggggh!” Yuto rolls his eyes harder, Yuya now looking at him as if he lost his mind.</p><p>And Yuto actually might’ve.</p><p>“What?” Yuya tilts his head. “If you want to pay that bad you could pay me and I transfer the money to–”</p><p>“Not that,” Yuto glares at him. “Who cares about that guy when you’re with me right now?”</p><p>Yuya is confused for a few seconds before his face hardens, voice low enough to send chills down Yuto’s spine. “‘That guy’ is my friend, someone I care about being safe.”</p><p><em> Uh oh</em>.</p><p>The serious tone catches Yuto off guard, stomach doing a flip. And not the good kind of flip. “I’m just saying he’s probably fine,” he tries to recover.</p><p>“Do you like to leave your friends behind, Nakajima?”</p><p>“No,” Yuto bites his bottom lip. “But what about you?” he points at him. “Leaving behind all your hook-ups? Just leaving me behind every time in the hotel?”</p><p>“What were you expecting? For us to stay and talk about butterflies and glitter after sex? Besides,” Yuya’s eyes narrow. “Yamada and you aren’t the same.”</p><p>The words are said as if it’s the most well known fact in history.</p><p>“Okay so what? After fucking him and then fucking me you’ll fuck him again?”</p><p>“We don’t do that every time we see each other,” Yuya frowns. “If you were listening to us talk instead of glaring at Yamada, you would know he’s coming over for video games.”</p><p>“Oh c’mon," Yuto waves his hands around. "As if you two won’t fuck after with your “physical” games,” he stresses like Ryosuke had.</p><p>“We don't have sex when he has early work, for your information," he says coldly. "Why do you care who I’m fucking?” he runs a hand through his hair. “Look, you already know I’m not interested in relationships, Nakajima. We agreed on only some good fucking.” He squints at him. “Again, what were you expecting? Did you want something more than what we agreed on or change your mind because go ahead and tell me before we continue this damn thing.”</p><p>Just what was Yuto expecting out of this sexual relationship? He knows they've both only had sexual interest in each other ever since they met in college, so why is he getting worked up over the thought of Yuya with others when Yuto gets what he wants and is satisfied?</p><p>But is he truly satisfied?</p><p>A mess of complicated feelings rumble inside his chest. “I don't know," he says honestly.</p><p>He just wants things to not stop.</p><p>Yuya eyes him before sighing. “I’ve got plenty of other people who I can swing in and out without any shitty feelings. Your choice, Nakajima Yuto.”</p><p>Yuto bites his bottom lip, the way he said that annoying him. “My choice?”</p><p>“Yeah you're welcome to leave before–”</p><p>“But it’s not just me,” Yuto stands his ground. “Got receipts of you asking me to come over more than me.” A tiny frown forms on Yuya's face, eyebrows furrowing slightly. “So who’s the one who will have a bigger loss?” he lets that sink in before continuing. “Why did you agree to dinner with me? What were <em>you</em> expecting?"</p><p>"That's just…" Yuya averts his gaze. "I figured we'd just have sex after like usual."</p><p>Yuto didn't miss that hesitation. "You like my ass, don’t you, Takaki?”</p><p>His eyes drop down, examining his still naked body before responding slowly, “I do like claiming that ass of yours.”</p><p>Yuto has him right where he wants him. He turns slightly to show off his ass with a little shake, almost laughing at how Yuya’s eyes immediately glue to it. He gives himself a light smack, amused at a tongue darting out to wet those lips he’s kissed countless times. “Up to you if you still want my ass.” he stands up as Yuya’s hand starts to reach over. “Anyways, I’m outta here.”</p><p>The ball is in Yuya's court.</p><p>As he gets dressed, Yuya doesn't stop him and Yuto doesn’t give him a second glance, gathering up all his stuff and heading out the door. Sure, Yuto might want Yuya, but it’s the same the other way around.</p><p>But Yuto’s not sure if they’re the same wants.</p><p>He doesn’t even know his own wants.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>He fists the sheets beneath him, sucking his teeth to keep himself from crying out loud. His mind is a complete jumble, the cock drilling his ass making him reach places he never would’ve thought existed, his orgasm zig zagging through a jungle of pleasure in his stomach to find the end. All perfect, just how he likes it and more.</p><p>“I’m– I’m close, fuck,” he moans, wrapping a hand over his own erection, threatening to spill any moment. “Please, please make me come, Yuya.”</p><p>With a grunt, the older comes inside him, filling him up so wonderfully that he comes himself too, spurting all over the sheets and a little on his chest. They fall onto the bed together, humming their satisfaction with idle fingers dragging across sensitive skin.</p><p>That is, until Ryosuke shifts and his leg starts uncontrollably spasming.</p><p>“Ughhhh, fucking hell,” Ryosuke groans, pain shooting up his body once Yuya slides out of him. "Damn you were rough tonight." He takes a deep breath. “Not that I mind, but still.”</p><p>"Was I?" Yuya says absentmindedly, lying on his back with his hands behind his head, catching his breath.</p><p>"You might not know this but believe it or not, I feel it in my ass," Ryosuke says, stretching out his legs. "And damn it, I'll feel it tomorrow and maybe the next day too, give me allll the pain killers."</p><p>"Sorry. You know where they are."</p><p>Ryosuke glares at him, knowing full well Yuya didn't mean his apology. "So, what’s up?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Yuya stares blankly at the ceiling.</p><p>“You fuck like this when you're all in your head. Thinking of that other guy? The guy with the…” he tilts his head. “The, you know,” he waves his hands around trying to help him think, orgasm clarity getting to his head. “The face?"</p><p>He rolls on his side to face him. "Nakajima?"</p><p>"Yeah that’s the guy,” Ryosuke snaps his fingers. “Please, <em> please </em> don't tell me you're fucking him like this, how has his skinny ass not broken yet?"</p><p>"He's more buff than you think, you haven’t seen him naked yet, have you?" Ryosuke shakes his head as Yuya envisions Yuto's body under him, strong arms holding himself up and how it feels to hold his waist as he fucks him. It's nothing like the hold he can get on Ryosuke's body — can’t compare to the elusive Chinen he has the honor of getting his hands on every so often — but still a better fuck than most other men. "Especially over the years."</p><p>Usually other men, not including Ryosuke, get bored or give up with him once they find out he’s just using them purely for pleasure. It’s all fun and games until the other person wants something more or serious and Yuya isn’t about that kind of life, not interested in being stuck with one person.</p><p>But Yuto…</p><p>Yuto has been the most fun to play with, dumb enough to keep coming back without asking for anything else like the others, giving him his heart to break. It’s perfect. The guy just can’t get enough of him after multiple months. Guess Yuya should be proud Yuto is so willing to return to him, giving his body to him. He doesn’t blame him, everyone he’s slept with saying how much of a good fuck he is — even Yuya himself wonders what it would be like.</p><p>Even after the whole spiel the other week, they never brought it up again, continuing their purely sexual relationship as planned after a short break. It might be somewhat less frequent lately, but it’s still something.</p><p>When will Yuto realize he’s just being used?</p><p>There’s a little shred of hope in Yuya that he’ll never realize.</p><p>Ryosuke hums, “Well, at least he’s eye candy.” Yuya gives him a look. "You look like you're going to murder me in cold blood, relax. I'm not going to do anything. He might be pretty but he seems annoying."</p><p>Yuya purses his lips. “He’s not annoying.” Then again, he doesn’t know much about him. He only remembers how his skin and ass feels and that’s more than enough. If he learns anything more then… "And I know you won't. But it doesn't matter because I'm not thinking about him."</p><p>"All I said was the guy with the face and you understood who I was referring to right away."</p><p>"He’s just fun to play with.”</p><p>Ryosuke lays down, scooting closer to him. "Okay okay, I know I said he's annoying, which he is, but maybe he’s not that bad. If he’s so fun then why not talk to him more?"</p><p>Yuya frowns. Talk? “We didn’t sign up for that.”</p><p>“Okay and? Did you sign up for dinner with him?” he rolls his eyes. “If looks could kill, I wouldn't be here with how he was glaring at me," Ryosuke shivers. "I haven't been at the club since."</p><p>"Your fault for provoking him," he lightly punches him. "And what's wrong with the club?"</p><p>“In case he's waiting for you,” he responds. “I was testing him," he pauses, saying more gently, "Maybe you should keep him, maybe he's what you need. He’s got this like… weird energy.”</p><p>Waiting for him? Why would he do that?</p><p>“Keep him? Test?” Yuya scoffs. “He’s the one who needs to try to keep me and will keep coming back even if I push him away.” He could leave Yuto on read for days then send a single message inviting him out and Yuto would jump at it.</p><p>He’s desperate.</p><p>Ryosuke stares at him blankly. “Well, maybe you shouldn’t push him away,” he says so quietly that Yuya almost doesn’t hear him. “Like you usually do.”</p><p>“Huh?” he pretends he didn’t.</p><p>“Give me a massage, Yuya~” Ryosuke switches tone, laying on his stomach. “Since it’s your fault I’ll be sore.”</p><p>Yuya doesn’t argue, idly massaging Ryosuke, listening to his sighs of relief. “Does this actually help?”</p><p>“Mhm,” Ryosuke hums affirmatively. “Aftercare is nice. Should do it more. Ahhh~ hits the spot~”</p><p>They don’t bring up the conversation again, Yuya just thinking about how Yuto always returns his calls.</p><p>It’s amazing how Yuto is so willing for him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Yuya kicks his feet hanging off his bed, staring up at the ceiling. He had taken a day off from work in the middle of the week to relax, yet he wonders if he should’ve just gone.</p><p>At least he would be making money.</p><p>He was supposed to meet up with Ryosuke today but got ditched by him for his video games — which unfortunately isn’t the first time — since apparently he got asked to fill in for a tournament. Ryosuke promised he’ll be free during the night, though Yuya has no idea how accurate that’ll be with how he loses track of time playing his games. Yuya said he wouldn’t mind being in the background to watch quietly as he plays but Ryosuke didn’t want him there as a distraction.</p><p>Not after what happened the last time he was with him while he was streaming… Good thing his camera wasn’t working that night.</p><p>He texts other friends, but unsurprisingly they're all busy. Giving up, he's about to text his boss if he could come in today after all when his finger pauses over a particular name.</p><p>Nakajima Yuto.</p><p>Well, why not?</p><p>Ryosuke’s words about Yuto replay in his head after he sends a message if he’s free, thinking about Yuto had casually asked him for dinner. But why should he do something like that? It’ll be a complete waste of time. He’s surprised he hasn’t gotten bored of Yuto yet and doesn’t know when that'll be. And he also doesn't know when Yuto will get bored of <em>him</em> and leave him, moving onto someone else more interesting.</p><p>Like others.</p><p>But then again… maybe… maybe if he spends more time with him… they can continue like this for longer.</p><p>However, when Yuya gets a text back 15 minutes later, Yuto says he’s already with someone else.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll fuck someone else…” Yuya mutters while typing.</p><p>He didn’t mean to actually send that, fingers moving automatically. But he doesn’t care, putting his phone down before bothering to read whatever Yuto sent back, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>He needs to get out of the house.</p><p>It’s lovely outside, his favorite season just beginning. With a deep inhale of Summer air, he regrets not having come out earlier. He’s already gone to the sea a few times, glad they're empty since the water is too cold for normal people.</p><p>But not to him, he says in his shorts and sandals. Yuya’s always ready. People can judge when Summer begins just by looking at him.</p><p>On his way to the shopping center, he takes an odd interest in a rather short tree. Last month when it was still Spring it was beautiful, fully alive with some kind of light purple flower he doesn’t know the name of. Yet, he cocks his head to the side, the flowers now just simple buds as if it isn’t the right time to bloom yet. The other flowers and other trees surrounding it are still breathing full life as they typically do.</p><p>What was wrong with this one?</p><p>With a shrug he goes on his way, wanting to browse for new clothes. He's looking through the leather jackets when he hears loud laughter.</p><p>“You look like a fucking clown,” an unfamiliar voice calls out while laughing. “Never buy this style <em> ever</em>.”</p><p>Yuya rolls his eyes, they’re in public and making this much noise?</p><p>“Do I really?” Yuya freezes at the second voice. “I thought it looked alright…”</p><p>Yuya peeks over a rack of clothes, spotting two men in front of a mirror. The taller one is trying on a jacket — that yeah made him look clownish — twisting his body around to get a look at all his angles. Yuya licks his lips at his sharp jawline, revealing arms when he takes the jacket off, arms he can’t get enough of wrapped around him, thin but surprisingly strong.</p><p>Nakajima Yuto has always been nice eye candy, after all. Ever since college.</p><p>But he squints at the other guy, confused at the interesting… round mushroom hairstyle. He swears he seems familiar when it hits him — the club! He’s seen him at the club before. He’s never talked to him but his friends have, hearing from them that he’s quite the sloppy bottom with a dirty mouth.</p><p>But if they’re together… then are they…?</p><p>Yuya frowns as the man seems rather touchy, hugging Yuto’s arm as he drags him to another clothes rack, picking out another hideous jacket. It bothers him how he’s touching Yuto, bothers him how he speaks to him in such a casual way.</p><p>“I bet this would look great on you, Yuto!” the mushroom says excitedly, tapping furiously on his arm.</p><p><em> That shit belongs in the trash</em>.</p><p>Yuto takes it, holding it up and examining it with uncertainty before his eyes glow. “Yeah! You’re right!”</p><p><em> Give me a damn break</em>, Yuya rolls his eyes as he wears it. So this is who Yuto blew him off for? A loud mushroom that’s sticking to him like glue? He’s never paid attention to Yuto’s clothes, but what he's already wearing under that awful jacket isn’t half bad. Yuto has the height and body to be a whole ass model and he’s out here wearing ugly jackets given to him. <em> If it were me I could pick a far better style that suits Nakajima</em>.</p><p>Yuya grits his teeth as the guy wraps his arms around Yuto’s shoulders while behind him, fixing his collar. He lowers his hands to his biceps, drawing little circles as he stands on his toes, leaning in to whisper something in his ear. Yuto’s eyes widen, turning on his heels to whisper something back, wondering if he's imagining the little flush of red in Yuto’s face.</p><p><em> I should be the one there</em>.</p><p>“I’m kidding~!” the man says in a sing-song voice, slinging an arm around his shoulders with a peace sign and making kissy faces at him.</p><p>“Inoo-chan!” Yuto pouts in such a cute way. “Heeey!”</p><p>The same way he does when Yuya denies him something.</p><p>He clicks his tongue when they laugh over something, having seen enough, leaving the shop without buying anything. The entire way back home, he couldn't stop thinking of how the man touched Yuto in public, wondering how else he might touch him in private. He can’t believe Yuto had gone off on him for sleeping with others when he clearly has someone else too!</p><p>Laying on his bed, he closes his eyes, images of Yuto’s arms popping into his head, skin warm and soft under him as he enters his ass, tight around him, listening to his gasps as he pushes in, perfectly full when he reaches his deepest point. He grips the sheets, unable to do it in the same elegant way that Yuto does, so erotic with how long and slender his fingers are, sheets wrapping around each finger of his. And don’t get him started on how nice those fingers are when they’re touching him — whether around his cock or on his back, clawing at him as if Yuya is the only thing keeping him up.</p><p>With a hand — imagining it’s Yuto’s — trailing down his body and taking a hold of his flaccid cock. He strokes himself to his imagination of Yuto, hardening in no time.</p><p>The look of pure desire in Yuto’s gorgeous eyes wanting him, all of him. It only takes a few words, even just a single word, for those eyes to roll back beautifully with a groan, squeezing around him with legs trembling.</p><p>It’s so easy.</p><p>Too easy.</p><p>But Yuya almost lost him. Without thinking that day, he told him he could leave. Yuto had a point, it would be his loss if he lost that sweet ass. Hell, he’s frustrated today Yuto blew him off to shop rather than blow his cock.</p><p>What would he have done if Yuto decided "you know what, you're right! Goodbye"?</p><p>What if Ryosuke is right?</p><p>Yuya growls as he squeezes himself, speeding up his hand until he finishes with no other thoughts in his head.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Distance.</p><p>Ever since Yuto found himself questioning what he wants from Yuya — which he still doesn’t know — he decided with Inoo's help to meet with him less, even denying calls in hopes that it lessens his urges. It's a little frustrating, fingers twitching to send Yuya a message and head over to him, but he takes deep breaths, distracting his mind. Instead, he spends more time with Inoo, just as they did before Yuya invaded his mind.</p><p>Now that it’s Summer, days are hot, Yuto preferring to be inside the comforts of his home. But just as he's getting comfortable in front of the TV, his doorbell rings. He ignores it at first, but whoever it is is persistent, ringing it in quick succession. He groans out loud, scrunching his face as he gets up to open it.</p><p>Did he order something online and forgot about it? Maybe while drunk? Did he order food? Is someone warning him that his car warranty is about to expire soon? Is it someone who wants to sell him something he doesn't need yet he buys anyway because he’s too awkward to say no? He hopes it’s at least candy bars… he still has light bulbs he’s never touched that a kid sold to him for a fundraiser three years ago.</p><p>He peeks through the view hole, eyes widening as he spots Yuya waiting on the other side.</p><p>Now that was <em> not </em> one of his options.</p><p>Earlier today Yuya had texted him asking for sex but Yuto passed, wanting to indulge in his quiet alone time instead. Yuya has been at his place only a few times for sex, Yuto usually being the one to head to his or to another spot. Frowning, he opens it, Yuya flinching, as if not expecting him.</p><p>“You’re home,” he says with a straight face.</p><p>“Isn’t it rude to show up without–”</p><p>“I’m coming in.” Yuya pushes through easily despite Yuto’s protests.</p><p>Yuto closes the door but doesn’t get to say anything because his breath leaves his chest as Yuya grabs onto his shirt collar, finding himself back against the wall. “Wha–?” he still can’t get out a thought with Yuya’s dark eyes piercing into his, creating a lump in his throat, heart trying to get past but failing.</p><p>“So you’re free to fuck?” Yuya says in a husky voice, damn melted chocolate to Yuto’s ears.</p><p>“Thanks for asking,” Yuto says sarcastically, Yuya's hold on him loosening as if ready to give up. “Normally people would call the police if someone barged into their home wanting to fuck them.” he grabs onto Yuya’s collar, tugging him close. Yuto might be slightly taller, but he can't deny being pinned to the wall is fucking hot. “But lucky for you, I am free now.”</p><p>He can’t say no to free, good sex landing right in front of him.</p><p>Yuya seems pleased, capturing his lips and using his tongue to open Yuto’s mouth for a messy kiss, rapidly heating up and melting against each other despite the short notice.</p><p>But that’s how easily Yuya can make Yuto weak and crumble apart, only just a snap of fingers and he’s completely hypnotized under his spell.</p><p>“Oh this shirt is pretty nice,” Yuya compliments, dragging a finger down his chest.</p><p>Yuto smugly smiles, puffing out his chest. “I look good in it, right?” Yuya hums, rubbing circles on his hips. “I bought it last month,” he adds.</p><p>Yuya’s fingers stops. “Last month?” his eyes narrow but Yuto doesn’t notice.</p><p>“Yeah, a friend helped me.” Yuto touches the material, comfortable under his fingertips. “Even got some new jeans.”</p><p>“Inoo?”</p><p>Yuto winces as nails dig into him, but he’s surprised to hear Inoo’s name. “Yeah? You know him?” he meets Yuya’s eyes, smile dropping as they glare at him, far darker than he’s ever seen, a different aura making him shiver. Attractive. But he doesn’t have time to ask when lips press onto him harder and hotter than before, the force pressing him back into the wall.</p><p>Hmm. Did mentioning Inoo…?</p><p>They break their kiss momentarily for Yuya to pull Yuto’s shirt over his head and toss it to the side, hand rubbing his exposed chest. Yuto throws his head back, gasping into Yuya’s mouth each time a nail scratches over a sensitive hardened nipple, barely getting any time to breathe. Yuya is in the same position, yet they still share a heated kiss, stealing what's left of each other’s breaths.</p><p>But Yuto needs more than just kissing, no matter how good it is. He reaches down, giving Yuya’s bulge a squeeze, loving how he groans against his lips and pushes his crotch into his hand. Before Yuto could say what he wanted, Yuya pulls away and drags him to his bedroom.</p><p>As Yuya scrambles for the lube, Yuto gathers his breath, willing his vocal chords to cooperate with him. “My friend Inoo-chan–” he licks his lips as Yuya’s head snaps towards him, eyebrows furrowed. “Has been keeping me real busy while you weren't–”</p><p>Yuya scowls, grabbing him by the throat and pinning him to the bed.</p><p><em> Holy shit</em>, Yuto thinks to himself, grinning when Yuya holds him there for a few seconds before releasing him, taking his own clothes off. What the fuck did Inoo do to this man to make him like this at just a mention? He knows Inoo frequents the club more than him, but Inoo didn’t know who Yuya was when he was first telling him about him, confident that Inoo wouldn’t go and find Yuya to sleep with him afterwards.</p><p>“Still haven’t undressed for me?” Yuya tsks. “Hurry the fuck up.”</p><p>“Aw, I have to do it myself?” Yuto says with a fake pout.</p><p>Yuya rolls his eyes. “Don’t be a fucking brat today, Yuto.”</p><p>The usage of his first name in that tone makes his heart skip a beat. But Yuto pouts for real, undressing like told. “Boring.”</p><p>However, he doesn’t have any complaints as Yuya doesn’t waste time teasing, pouring lube on his erection and stroking himself to spread the substance. Eyes on Yuya’s cock, Yuto doesn’t realize what’s happening when he gets flipped onto his elbows and knees, ass pulled up and two wet fingers pushed into his hole, thrusting in and out at a quick pace.</p><p>“Yuuuyaaa–” Yuto whines as Yuya mercilessly thrusts his fingers, earning a particularly hard thrust when he says his name. “Give me your fucking– ah– cock already.”</p><p>Yuya pulls his fingers out without hesitation, Yuto barely feeling the tip of his cock pressing against his hole before being shoved in, the burn of the stretch from taking in his entire length within a second overwhelming him. Thankfully Yuya doesn’t start thrusting as soon as possible like Yuto expected, squeezing and spreading his ass cheeks and feeling the soft curves. He gives the fleshy part of his ass a light smack, Yuto moaning at the pressure with Yuya’s cock filling him.</p><p>Yuya leans into his ear, growling, “I thought I said your ass is mine. Why are you still with that other guy?”</p><p>“What? Inoo?” A harder smack.</p><p>Yuya purses his lips. “Who else have you been fucking?”</p><p>Yuto licks his lips. “Just Inoo,” he emphasizes the name. nails digging into his ass. “Oh right, you don’t like whenever I mention Inoo,” he says teasingly, wiggling his ass.</p><p>Yuya grabs the back of his head, twisting him around to face him. “Don’t mention that fucking name again.”</p><p>With that, Yuya starts thrusting into him roughly, one hand holding his head in place with the other grabbing his hips to pull him in deep, surely leaving finger sized bruises. “Ah! Fu– Yes!” Yuto can barely speak words, only moaning loudly, not caring if anyone might hear. “Nnngh–! Hkdhgdkg!”</p><p>And maybe Yuto would love if someone heard how good Yuya is fucking him.</p><p>Yuya's breath is hot on his face and his hair keeps getting into his open mouth with each thrust, but Yuto doesn’t mind. As long as he doesn’t stop moving inside him, anticipating the release he’ll have, each little movement hastily building him up.</p><p>“It’s as if your hole was made just for me, Yuto,” Yuya coos, giving his ass another smack. “All for me, all mine.” Another smack.</p><p>“Ah–! Fuck!” he cries out, gripping the sheets beneath him with knuckles turning as white as them. “I– I–”</p><p>“What’s wrong, Yuto?” Yuya asks darkly, yanking Yuto’s hair up. He doesn’t get to answer — not that he had one — because Yuya latches his mouth onto Yuto’s neck, biting and sucking hard. “All mine,” he mutters against him before relocating his mouth to a new spot with the same treatment, leaving bites and bruises all over his sensitive skin.</p><p>Something about this frenzied Yuya stimulates raw nerves in Yuto’s body, frantically wanting to squirm from the attack of sensations rushing through him so fast his brain can’t keep up with them, yet he’s pinned down, stuck to take it all. Intense is an understatement, overwhelming and dizzying him.</p><p>Yet, it’s fucking great, loving this side of Yuya. It’s hotter, wilder than all the other sex they've had. Makes him really feel like Yuya’s as <em> his </em> cock fills him up so gloriously over and over again, bringing him up the edge of his high.</p><p>“I’m going to– come all in your– ass,” Yuya huffs between thrusts.</p><p>And Yuto can bring Yuya to his too.</p><p>“Fuck, yes–” Yuto gets out, eager to have Yuya’s come fill him up. "Yes!"</p><p>With a shout, Yuya thrusts deeply, pulsing and emptying himself within him. Yuto doesn’t need to touch himself as his own orgasm rips through him harder than it has in awhile, losing himself in a world of blackness as waves fuel up his veins with liquid fire, rushing back and forth his body. A scream rings in his ears for a moment before realizing it was his own voice. When Yuya pulls out, Yuto’s arms and legs give out, collapsing on soft sheets, material almost painful on his sensitive skin, body vibrating. His throat is dry, yet he swallows pools of saliva filling his mouth, drool dripping down the corner of his mouth, body involuntarily twitching with the aftershocks of pleasure.</p><p>With closed eyes, he rolls over onto his side, curling up to a mass of warmth while breathing heavily, not wanting to move, too comfortable.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>“Did I hurt you?” A strange angelic voice says softly.</p><p>“Wha?” Yuto gets out, cringing at the scratchiness. He opens his eyes to find a broad chest, taking a few long seconds to realize it’s Yuya. Before he could jump away, an arm under him — that he didn’t know was there — pulls him back. “Huh?”</p><p>“Did I hurt you?” Yuya repeats, making him look at him.</p><p>Yuto furrows his brows, still dazed from his orgasm to understand the question, lost in Yuya’s eyes. “No? Maybe?”</p><p>“Maybe?”</p><p>“A good hurt. I think.”</p><p>“Good? You think?”</p><p>Fucking fantastic, actually. But the words stick in Yuto’s throat.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then can I…”</p><p>Yuto flinches when a hand slides down his back, fingers pressing into his lower back. “Look, I-I can’t do round two right now though.” He starts to squirm away but Yuya holds him in place. “Takaki–” he stops when he notices the strained expression on Yuya’s face, eyes averting its gaze.</p><p>“That err,” Yuya lightly scrunches his nose. “That’s not what I meant– not what I wanted, I just– I just wanted to–” Yuya starts massaging his hip, making Yuto sigh with relief. “Just wanted to help ease the… maybe pain.” He stops moving his fingers. “Is that… okay?”</p><p>“Oh,” Yuto says simply, surprised by this action. “Go, uh, go ahead.”</p><p>Yuya nods, massaging his fingers in small circles with sweet, gentle pressure. They’re usually in and out for sex, having agreed not to be intimate afterwards, so he’s pleasantly surprised his fingers and hands are good at this too as they roam across his body, kneading his muscles.</p><p>“A little higher– ohh right there,” Yuto groans. “Ohh fuck, holy fuuuuck.”</p><p>“That good?” Yuya murmurs with a hint of amusement.</p><p>“Try getting your ass fucking pounded then– oh that’s mmm, try having your ass… fuck, ah,” he whines. “Your ass… Damn it. Yeah it’s good,” he gives up, succumbing to the relief. This doesn’t feel real to Yuto, never would've expected to receive such gentle aftercare from Yuya like this. But he relishes in it, nearly drifting off to sleep, oddly safe and comfortable under warm hands. "This is pure gold."</p><p>After a while, Yuya asks, “You have painkillers, right?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Okay cool,” Yuya sits up, Yuto whining from the loss of comforting contact but Yuya leans down and gives the top of his hair a gentle kiss. “Go take them.”</p><p>Yuto just blinks as Yuya breaks away, quietly getting dressed. “Who the fuck are you and what did you do to Takaki?”</p><p>He stops, eying him. “Yuya,” he says simply.</p><p>“Well, <em> Yuya</em>, uh,” he says tentatively, sucking on his bottom lip. “Thanks for… that,” he says, scratching the back of his neck. “The massage I mean. That was, that was nice. The sex too, was good,” he adds frantically.</p><p>“Mhm,” Yuya doesn’t say anything else, heading out.</p><p>Yuto's body is still vibrating over the sex and now also over that gap he just witnessed. Yuya’s fingers are textually rough yet they touched him like soft marshmallows, magically comforting and healing his body from all his aches and pains. It was sweet and caring, making his heart do these little flutters, beating rapidly in his chest, radiating warmth throughout his body.</p><p>That was… <em> weird</em>.</p><p>But Yuto kind of liked it.</p><p> </p><p>The bud in Yuto shudders, light peeking in on the insides.</p>

  <p>As expected, Yuto finds muscles he didn’t know could get sore are sore the next day as if he had done a full body workout yesterday. He examines his new bruises in the mirror, thinking they look quite good on him, clearly seeing why Yuya keeps coming back to mark him. He’s glad he didn’t have work today, or else he would’ve called in sick, lazy to cover up said marks (there's also no way he can be like “sorry can’t move well, got fucked too hard”).</p><p>After finding the perfect spot to lie down and keep his heating pad on his abdomen, he hears his doorbell ring, hoping whoever it is goes away. But it’s silent and Yuto gets up anyway, feeling bad about ignoring them.</p><p>Yesterday he got a pleasant surprise waiting at his door after all, remembering how Yuya had touched him so sweetly after sex with a shiver. He can't get that bit out of his head, confused if he liked that more than the sex itself.</p><p>Looking outside, no one is there. He would have dismissed this as a prank, but an urge told him to open the door. Peeking out showed no signs of life, air still and warm. He's just about to call out when something on his doorsteps catches his eye.</p><p>A box of painkillers on top of a note.</p><p>
  <em> “Hi. Sorry. Bought these for you.” </em>
</p><p>Yuto bursts out laughing at the hastily written note despite the pain in his abs. There’s no name attached but only one person could’ve done this, absolutely adorable that he went out of his way to buy medicine and set them in front of his house, running away with no contact.</p><p>Sorry? Sorry for what? Fucking him too good?</p><p>“What a big goof,” he giggles, thinking of how he should text him a thank you, appreciating the action.</p><p>The highlight of his day.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It’s well into Summer, Yuto blessing whoever had the genius idea of air conditioning and fans, sitting in front of one singing “ahhhhh” while giggling to himself over the voice change.</p><p>He’s easily entertained and it’s okay because it makes him happy.</p><p>As he’s still singing into the fan to get his mind off the heat, his phone rings, picking it up without looking at the name. “Hello?”</p><p>“<em>Hey</em>.”</p><p>Yuto stiffens. Just that voice and single word alone makes him melt more than the sweltering heat of the sun.</p><p>“What’s up, Takaki?”</p><p>They haven’t spoken since that day other than a few frisky texts, quite shy hearing his voice now over the phone. He bites his lip when he remembers Yuya’s fingers again, missing those wonderful sensations across his skin.</p><p>“<em>I’m driving to the beach right now, wanna join me?</em>”</p><p>Beach? Yuto furrows his eyebrows. “Isn’t the beach the opposite way from your place to mine?”</p><p>Why is Yuya asking him to go to the beach? Does he want to fuck in public? Not that he minds that, but Yuya’s tone seems… excited? And not sexually excited like other times they’ve discussed where they’re going for sex.</p><p>“<em>I just happened to be nearby, do you want to join or not? </em>”</p><p>“Yeah sure!” Yuto says automatically, not wanting to waste an opportunity to be with him. “I’d love to.”</p><p>“<em>Cool. Be there– eh? Is your connection bad? Or mine?” </em></p><p>“What do you mean? I hear you fine.”</p><p><em> “Oh, it’s okay now… your voice sounded robotic I don’t know what happened…” </em> Yuto holds in his laughter as Yuya speaks with confusion while staring at the culprit. The fan. He's about to purposely say something into the fan to hear his reaction again but Yuya continues, “<em>Anyways, be there soon and make sure you bring swimwear.</em>”</p><p>Yuya hangs up, Yuto's arm dropping to his side.</p><p>Does he have a pair of swimming trunks?</p><p>He rushes to his clothes drawer, swearing he has an older pair buried somewhere. He’s not sure the last time he went swimming, preferring to soak in his clean, private, indoor bathtub at his leisure.</p><p>“Ah! Here we… are,” Yuto finds what he was looking for, pulling out swimming trunks.</p><p>Light blue littered with lilac cartoon bunnies.</p><p>He winces at how childish it is, but tries them on anyway. The fabric hugs his now thicker thighs, doing some squats to try stretching them out. Or is he making it worse by thickening his thighs more? He frowns, rearranging his private parts and wondering how they’ll feel soaked in water but he doesn’t have much time to think about it when he gets another call.</p><p>“<em>Hey, I’m outside–</em>”</p><p>“Be there soon!” Yuto hangs up without waiting for a response.</p><p>Was he that close to his house?!</p><p>Putting on a pair of shorts to hide his embarrassing swimwear, he packs random clothes into a bag to change into after, running around the house twice to make sure he has the essential items he needs for a day out, mentally checking off each one. After slathering on sunscreen and triple checking everything, Yuto takes a deep breath before heading out to meet Yuya.</p><p>Who looked as if Summer transformed into a living person with his sunglasses and beach-like clothes, dark hair highlighted and skin tanned from the sun.</p><p>The drive is awkward, Yuya not saying a single word after a simple greeting. Yuto thought maybe they’d share a kiss or two by now since it’s been awhile since seeing each other in person but Yuya keeps his gaze steady on the road and hands to himself.</p><p>Kissing? Was he expecting sex in the car?</p><p>Yuto finds himself staring, sheepishly facing the open window before he gets caught. Closing his eyes, he enjoys the warm but nice breeze blowing on his face and through his hair. Getting closer to the sea, he smells the salt in the dampened air, hears the cheers of people and sounds of seagulls stealing people’s food.</p><p>Once they get out of the car, Yuya immediately removes his shirt, barely visible purple marks littering his skin. He pulls his shorts down to reveal swimming trunks under them, a bold royal purple with bright streaks that compliments his naturally tanned body, rich salted caramel glistening under the sun rays as he shakes out his curls of hair (has it gotten longer since Yuto has last seen him?). It takes Yuto’s breath away to see him practically glow naturally, only having seen his body under artificial lights.</p><p>He’s… glorious…</p><p>“Nakajima?”</p><p>The voice breaks him out of his thoughts. “Huh?”</p><p>He was so focused on his body he didn’t realize Yuya had taken out a surfboard.</p><p>Surfing?</p><p>“Are you going to just stand there gawking at me or…?” he smirks.</p><p>With a blush rising in his neck, he takes off his own shirt — body pale in comparison — pausing before removing his shorts, blush rising more as he reveals his own swimming trunks.</p><p>
  <span>“I see you're a man of culture wearing your swimwear under clothes… they’re…” Yuya's eyes stare low.</span>
</p><p>Yuto shifts his weight around his legs at his gaze. “It’s an older pair because I didn’t have time to buy new ones with this sudden plan,” he says, ears burning, wishing he asked him to stop by a store. “I know they’re childish but I didn’t want to throw them out and–”</p><p>“I like them.”</p><p>
  <span>“...Huh?”</span>
</p><p>Yuya cocks his head to the side, eyes still focused downwards. “They’re a nice shade of blue even though they’ll be hard to see underwater – but don’t worry I’ll save you if you start to drown, and the cute bunnies compliment them,” he responds casually, turning towards the water. “Now let’s go swim.”</p><p>“...Eh?”</p><p>Yuto stands dumbfounded watching Yuya's back, having expected him to make fun of him. Yet he complimented him. And said he would save him if he drowned. That’s… charming of him. Is this the part where Yuto gets swept away to the middle of the sea and has Yuya rescue him with a kiss?</p><p>Yuto chuckles to himself. Maybe this guy has a heart after all.</p><p>It’s a typical Summer day, hot sand sparkling and reflecting the sun’s brightness, blinding him. It's rough yet soft, as if it’ll suck him like quicksand under burning heat for eternity if he stays still too long. Sand slips between his sandals and in between his toes, careful to avoid any sharp shards of shells or rocks. There’s people all around, nearly tripping over a child who scurries past him, self-conscious of all the eyes on him.</p><p>“Nakajima!”</p><p>The voice breaks his thoughts, Yuya already knee deep in the water with one arm around his surfboard, waving furiously at him. Yuto realizes they both left everything other than the board in the car, even his phone he had so carefully placed in a waterproof bag.</p><p>“C’mon, get in!” he urges when Yuto gets close enough, sand cool and damp from the water creeping towards him. “You can swim, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, I used to play water polo,” he says, wading into the water next to him, sighing from the relief of the chilly water.</p><p>“What?” Yuya exclaims. “No way, so did I!”</p><p>Yuto looks at him with surprise. “Seriously? I’m skilled, you know,” he brags.</p><p>Yuya smacks his forehead. “Argh, If I had known you like water polo I would've brought a ball and nets.” He points at him. “Next time I challenge you to a match.”</p><p>“Here? You are so on, Takaki," Yuto cracks his knuckles. “It’s been awhile since I’ve played, I used to have this awful blond hair.”</p><p>“You? Blond?” Yuya chuckles, the wonderful sound reverberating in Yuto’s chest. He might like to hear that sound more often. “Man, I’d love to see that.”</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>“C’mon, just one photo.”</p><p>“I deleted them all.”</p><p>“Hmm, really?”</p><p>Yuya tosses his surfboard to the side, Yuto watching as it flies into the sand. But because his eyes were misdirected, he doesn’t see Yuya before he tackles him, Yuto shrieking and stumbling backwards, both nearly falling into the water. Before Yuto could regain his balance Yuya starts tickling him, making him laugh uncontrollably.</p><p>“Takaki!” Yuto laughs out as hands attack his sides. “Stop that!”</p><p>“Not until you show me a photo of your blond hair!” he grins evilly.</p><p>“Okay! Okay!” Yuto says out of breath, holding his hands out to distance himself. He could see the older is also breathing heavily from attacking him, bare chest moving up and down. “Just kidding.”</p><p>Before Yuya could react, Yuto lunges forward, tackling him into the water, creating a large splash as they both go under the surface. Yuto pops up first, gasping as Yuya follows with his hair flying up in slow motion with water flying out onto him like a hair commercial. He could only stare when Yuya runs a hand through his now wet hair, pushing it from his face.</p><p>“Oh you’ve done it now Nakajima,” Yuya rubs his hands together.</p><p>“Bring it on.” Yuto motions with a finger.</p><p>They mess around in the water, slippery wrestling at first before competing over swimming races and doing underwater flips (Yuto refuses to believe Yuya hasn’t done special training or isn't aquatically altered).</p><p>“You hate to lose, huh?” Yuya grins triumphantly when he wins again.</p><p>“One more time!” Yuto slaps the water, chest heaving. “This time will be mine, I know it.”</p><p>Yuto forgot they're in public, but he didn’t mind, didn’t care, having too much fun to give a damn what people think, letting himself enjoy this moment. He only cares that he's with Yuya right now, laughing along Yuya, having a connection with Yuya. He hasn’t felt this alive in awhile, cheeks starting to ache from smiling so much, stomach hurting from laughing too much.</p><p>It was all natural, as if they've always laughed like this together.</p><p>Yuto rushes to tackle Yuya to get an advantage in a race when his foot gets caught in some seaweed, yelping as he loses his balance and stumbles forward.</p><p>Directly into a pair of strong arms catching him.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>The low voice makes Yuto freeze, Yuya’s chest moving unevenly against his cheek. He slowly rises his head, faces dangerously close enough to feel his breath, his own leaving his body as worried eyes stare down into him. Yuto’s brain short circuits, clutching onto Yuya’s back, ears ringing with the sea breeze and waves flowing rhythmically, rocking their floating bodies together. Yuya’s hands slide down to his lower back, caressing his skin, pulling him in ever so closer. They’re surrounded by water yet Yuto’s mouth becomes dry, gulping and wetting his lips as Yuya’s eyes drop downwards, throat moving to swallow, a drop of water rolling off his face.</p><p>Were his trunks always this tight?</p><p>But Yuya clears his throat. “Time out?” he says breathily, hot against his lips. “Let’s go sit.”</p><p>Heart racing and mind dazed, Yuto lets himself get led back to the shore, Yuya’s hand around his wrist. “Thankfully no one stole your surfboard,” he says as Yuya lets him go, a scream reminding him other people exist.</p><p>“People know me well enough here not to." someone waves to Yuya as if on cue, waving back. “I’m a regular, I come here every day I can during Summer, even just for a little bit after work to relax.”</p><p>Guess that explains why Yuya is tanner than the last time he saw him.</p><p>“What do you do here every day? Pick up shells?” he teases.</p><p>“Nah.”</p><p>“Swim? Surf?”</p><p>“Not all the time,” Yuya says, amused. “Sometimes I just sit by the shore.”</p><p>Hmm. Yuya has always struck him as an active person, always on the move and talking to people. “Alone? Doesn’t it get boring?”</p><p>“Nope. It’s nice to wind down here,” Yuya stops to gaze at the sea. “It's beautiful no matter the time, sunrise, middle of the day, sunset, night. The sea reflects it all," he deeply inhales. "Where the water runs even on bad days, where the salty breeze wraps around like a gentle hug, where the sun shines and recharges my batteries,” he glances at Yuto. “It’s where I can chill and collect my thoughts.”</p><p>Yuto could only stare at Yuya’s side profile, a smile of pure adoration while gazing at the sea, a glitter of joy in his eyes, hair fluttering in the breeze. It’s the softest he’s ever seen him, unbelieving that this calm, poetic Yuya is the same Yuya who lives on the rush of life, the one who wears leather jackets and rides motorcycles.</p><p>What does he know?</p><p>Yuya treasures the beach. Treasures the beach so much he keeps returning even if it’s the same every time, still gaining a flood of satisfaction. Even on the worst days, it heals him, wanting to stay and spend his limited time and admire its picture perfectness forever. It fulfills an itch in him to gaze at the alluring beauty that captivated him from first sight. It pulls on his center of gravity, completely surrendering to the charms that imprisons him, soothes a hunger to experience the raw pleasure of being in a land of fantasy even if only for a few minutes.</p><p>Yuto knows that feeling.</p><p>It’s… it’s… L–</p><p>“I can even drive here with my eyes closed!” Yuya gives him a thumbs up.</p><p>“Please don’t,” Yuto says immediately.</p><p>They didn’t have anything to sit on, ending up sitting on the sand.</p><p>
  <span>“The waves today aren’t good,” Yuya pouts, using his board to dig in the sand like a shovel, Yuto finding it adorable. “The weather app lied.”</span>
</p><p>Sure enough, there’s only small waves, not enough to surf. Yet despite being tiny, they pushed their bodies together, rocking gently in the water. “Just come back another day.”</p><p>“I wanted to surf <em> today </em> though,” Yuya whines.</p><p>He’s amused with seeing this side of Yuya. “Summer will be here for a while longer, there’s plenty of time.”</p><p>“But today…” he mumbles. “Today you’re here.”</p><p>“Huh?” Yuto turns to him. “What does that matter? Am I a water God? How did you find out I could water bend?” he thrusts his hand out, trying to control the waves. “Damn, my powers are too weak today.”</p><p>Yuya bursts into laughter, Yuto beaming that he made him laugh. Yuya's voice quiets. “I wanted to show you how cool surfing is,” he says. “I wanted to show you a cool side of me because I don't have many good qualities.”</p><p>Yuto blinks. “You're already cool to me.”</p><p>He tilts his head in confusion. “I am?”</p><p>The hope in his bright eyes takes Yuto aback but makes him smile. “Yeah. I like your entire style and allll your features, Takaki,” he says as genuinely as possible, motioning his hands around him.</p><p>And maybe more than that.</p><p>Yuya doesn’t say anything but the way he holds back a smile while swirling his hand in the sand lets Yuto know he’s happy hearing his words. If he can see Yuya like that more, he'll compliment him all the time to build up his confidence. It’s adorable he wanted to surf for him, surprised that Yuya doesn't think he's already cool, having always screamed confidence, having thought he was ever since college. Even the him now is cool.</p><p>
  <span>And the fact he wanted to be cool for him in the first place rumbles in his chest.</span>
</p><p>“Yuto…”</p><p>His name catches him off guard. “Huh?”</p><p>Yuya leans back on his hands. “Nakajima takes too much effort in saying, it’s a pain in the ass.”</p><p>Yuto grins, seeing the slight pink in his ears. “Okay whatever you say… Yuuuuya.”</p><p>Yuya's lips twitch in a smile. “Alright!” he stands up. “Time to get back into the water!” he holds out his hand to Yuto. “Want to come with?”</p><p>Yuto stares at the hand, large and inviting. He’s held that hand often during their encounters, but seeing it now feels different. More appealing, more gentle. He clasps it. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p>
  <span>That moment… something shifted.</span>
</p><p>Yuto had no idea what he signed up for. Yuya’s hand is pleasantly warm despite the Summer heat, thicker and sturdier than his. They’re comfortable to hold, strong as Yuya yanks him up and immediately starts pulling him towards the water. Yuto almost stumbles over his own legs, not prepared to start running, eyes focused on how their hands are still connected as they run straight into the water.</p><p>“Cold!” Yuto exclaims, giving Yuya a glare.</p><p>But Yuya just flashes his teeth.</p><p>And Yuto melts.</p><p>Yuto gets ready for another battle when Yuya turns to the side, diving into the water. He panics a bit when Yuya doesn’t come back up right away, then his head pops out further into the deeper end, water up to his chest. With a smile, Yuto swims over to join him, Yuya waiting for him.</p><p>As they swim around casually, Yuto finds himself in awe with how graceful Yuya is in the crystal clear water, body moving smoothly as if made to swim. His heart skips a beat every time Yuya pushes back his wet hair with skin glistening in the sun and a huge smile on his face. When he laughs at every little thing, it’s music to his ears, rumbling deep within his chest.</p><p>It’s odd.</p><p>Yuto just can’t seem to stop thinking about how Yuya had touched him so gently when in his arms, holding him up, supporting him. And seeing how happily he’s smiling now brings joy to his heart, soothing him and desiring to see more of these expressions. He just stares, trying to burn these images into his brain, wanting this delightful moment to last forever, wanting to keep seeing this side of Yuya. It fills him up with happiness, with delight and glee.</p><p>But unfortunately, days come to an end.</p><p>As they head back to the car together, Yuto stares at Yuya’s hand by his side, thinking about how nice it felt to hold it. He reaches out to grab it when Yuya raises it to his face.</p><p>“Ah! I must have dropped my ring somewhere!”</p><p>“Shit, that sucks–”</p><p>“Stay here, I’ll be back!” Yuya is already running off.</p><p>Yuto watches him run back towards the water, muscles and legs moving through the sand effortlessly. It'll be near impossible to find a tiny ring in such a vast beach, why try? With a sigh, he wanders around the car while waiting for Yuya, taking in the scenery of the beach.</p><p>But one thing catches his eye, walking towards it as if it’s calling for him.</p><p>A bloomerang lilac tree.</p><p>He bends by it, admiring their gorgeous deep purple color fluttering gently in the sea breeze, wishing he had his camera to take photos. He’s always thought these flowers were funny, first blooming as a lovely pale purple during mid Spring and then retreating for a short time in early Summer, only to bloom again as a richer, deeper purple only a month later, lasting until the first frost.</p><p>Dramatic flowers he thinks so himself.</p><p>And yet, they're also quite magical. Breathing beautiful life for a period of time before taking a break despite others continuing their lives. Then they return, reblooming to their fullest, more beautiful and longer lasting than ever. Yuto takes that to heart, that sometimes you need a little break after living, a little time to take a pause to think and rewind rather than continuously rushing in and leading to burn out. That way you can recharge yourself and come back stronger, ready to take on life’s challenges. That way you can absorb the good parts of life.</p><p>With the second bloom, you're more knowledgeable and ready.</p><p>“Yuto?”</p><p>He looks up when he hears his name, Yuya doing a silly half jog half speed walk to get to him.</p><p>“Yuya…” Yuto whispers, Yuya happily waving his hand and seeing the sparkle of a ring on his finger.</p><p>So he did the impossible.</p><p>
  <em>Yuto first met Yuya in college, admiring him from afar and had fun for a single short night together.</em>
</p><p>“What are you doing?” he asks, noticing the lilacs. “Oh! These flowers…” Yuya gently touches a petal. “Thank goodness they’re blooming, I saw one of these that wasn’t recently,” he says with happy relief. Before Yuto could explain how they bloom twice, Yuya smiles at him so brightly it chokes him up. “Aren’t they beautiful?”</p><p>
  <em>The two lost contact after they graduated, breaking away and forgetting each other.</em>
</p><p>“You like flowers?” Yuto hums. “Surprising.”</p><p>“They’re nice, I always send some to my parents at least once a year,” Yuya says. “I never know what to do with them myself, watering them until they… until they unfortunately die,” he gives a small, somewhat sad nod towards the flowers. “So I try to keep them alive as long as I can.”</p><p>
  <em>Yet they managed to find each other again after years.</em>
</p><p>“Hmm, that’s sweet,” he hums. “I work as a photographer and have photos of all kinds of flowers if you want to see them," he suggests without thinking.</p><p>Yuya’s eyes light up like a kid who got his favorite toy as a present. “Yes please!” he turns back to the flowers. “Do you mind if I stop by the store to pick a bouquet on the way back? I think I’ll give some to my parents today.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>“Just because.”</p><p>
  <em>They might’ve rushed in without thinking properly, having fun fooling around.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But…</em>
</p><p>Yuto’s heart squeezes, loving how despite Yuya’s impression of a thorny playboy, he has some soft spots in him, capable of being gentle at times. It made today special, able to see this cheerful side of Yuya, able to see him so joyous for the several hours they didn’t realize had passed, enjoying every second together.</p><p>
  <em>Hm?</em>
</p><p>Yuto’s eyes widen as he watches how Yuya gently pet the flowers as if they’re fragile and will break under his touch, just as he had so lovingly touched him that day and how much he liked it.</p><p>
  <em>Uh oh.</em>
</p><p>And now, the bud that Yuya had planted years ago in Yuto's chest begins to unfold itself involuntarily, stronger than ever.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Yuto can’t get the beach day out of his head. Even when trying to focus on something else — anything else — images of a radiant Yuya gleaming under the sun in crystal water and sensations of innocent warm, wet skin on skin contrasting with the cool water take over his mind. His heart races, makes him sweat, having to fan his flushed skin as his stomach flutters.</p><p>His head is on a roller coaster.</p><p>After failing to distract his thoughts by hugging his Blåhaj all day, he jumps when his phone rings, squinting at the name.</p><p>He cannot escape him, can he?</p><p>“Hey Yuya, how’s it going?” he swallows to help his dry throat.</p><p>“<em>Hey, Yuto. Things are fine. You busy right now?</em>”</p><p>Busy thinking of you. “No, why?”</p><p>“<em>Want to have dinner with me?</em>”</p><p>The question sends new questions spiraling in his head. It’s that time already? He swears he woke up with the sun up 10 minutes ago. Why does he want to have dinner with him? Just the two of them? No random Ryosukes? Or Ariokas? What else does he want?</p><p>“<em>Uh, we don’t have to go out if you don’t want to, I can pick something up on the way,</em>” Yuya says after Yuto doesn’t answer. “<em>And um, you said you had photos of flowers? I’d like to see them.</em>”</p><p>Oh. That’s all he wants.</p><p>“Yeah, sure.”</p><p>Should he be disappointed that’s it or flailing over how adorable he wants to see his photos?</p><p>“<em>Sure to me bringing something over? Want anything specific?</em>”</p><p>“Just bring whatever you’re feeling.” His stomach does a flip.</p><p>“<em>Hmm okay, I’ll be over soon. Wait for me.</em>”</p><p>Yuto releases his stuffed shark, not realizing how tightly he was squeezing it during their phone call.</p><p>Then it hits him.</p><p>Oh my God, Yuya is coming over for dinner.</p><p>He rushes to clean whatever he can to prepare, clearing the table, washing old dishes in the sink, tossing a pair of forgotten jeans into a laundry bag to wash later. When the doorbell rings, Yuto has to take several deep breaths before opening it with a smile, trying to hide that he was out of breath while letting him in. After greeting each other normally — or as normally as he can muster — Yuto notices Yuya has two bags with him, one larger than the other.</p><p>“What did you get?”</p><p>He hands the smaller bag to him. “Dinner, hope you like gyudon.”</p><p>“I do,” Yuto takes it, staring at the other. “And that one is also gyudon?”</p><p>Yuya licks his lips. “This one is nothing, not important.” he eyes Yuto. “If I say “don’t open this” will you <em> not </em> have an urge to open it the moment I let it go?”</p><p>Yuto smiles sweetly, placing his hands behind him. “Of course I won’t.”</p><p>“You liar.”</p><p>After Yuto fails at grabbing the unknown bag a few times, he gives up, agreeing not to peek inside until told to. They settle at the table, taking out their meals. Of course, not without another glance at that curious bag.</p><p>“Jeez, these are huuuge bowls,” Yuto compares the size of his face to it.</p><p>“Too heavy? Should I have gotten something lighter?” he asks worriedly.</p><p>“No it’s perfect,” Yuto waves his hand. “I’m starving.”</p><p>
  <span>He may have forgotten to eat during the day due to his overthinking, distracted by the beach day.</span>
</p><p>As they eat, the atmosphere is awkward at first, talking about their days at work. But gradually the conversation lightens up as Yuya brings up how he tried to ride some dolphins the other day but failed, Yuto in shock untrained professionals can do such a thing.</p><p>“You should have seen it, he was clearly struggling then bam!” Yuya slams a hand on the table. “Literally the next try he just stood on top of the dolphin like a total pro! It was incredible to watch!”</p><p>“I can’t even imagine someone standing on a still dolphin," Yuto’s jaw drops in awe. "I won’t believe it unless there’s video proof, he must be crazy talented.”</p><p>“Oh he’s talented all right,” Yuya nods with a grin. “His broad body is talented in…” he stops with his mouth half open. “All sorts of, uh, ways.” he scratches his cheek, averting his gaze for a second.</p><p>Yuto notices. “You know him personally?”</p><p>He tenses. “Just a friend.”</p><p>Yuto’s fingers twitch. “That’s cool,” he gives him a small smile, thinking about how Yuya had bragged that he has plenty of other people. “You have a lot of friends. Kind of jealous, I really only have one friend,” he says, picking at his food.</p><p>Should he mention Inoo's name?</p><p>“Hey, Yuto,” Yuya says softly, shifting in his seat.</p><p>Yuto waits but Yuya doesn’t continue, the awkward air returning. He wishes he didn’t question their relationship. “We haven’t had a meal with just the two of us yet, right?” he tries to lighten the mood. “It was nice seeing you tonight.”</p><p>“We haven’t?” Yuya thinks for a moment, nodding slowly. “Huh, we haven’t. Wonder why it took us so long.”</p><p>Yuto blinks at him. "The last time we tried…" he doesn’t finish his sentence, Yuya nodding.</p><p>Come to think of it, the beach day was the first time they met for longer than 5 minutes and didn't end with sex. Sure, it might’ve passed through his mind, but it wasn't the reason they met. They met that day just to have fun in an innocent way. They've never done that before.</p><p>
  <span>And it was… enjoyable.</span>
</p><p>“Yuto,” Yuya says more forcefully than the first time. “I wanted to talk to you about something.”</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. “About?”</p><p>Yuya stands up to walk over to him, eyes locked into his. During that short, slow walk over, a million thoughts race through Yuto’s head, tensing up as his heart reaches his throat, pounding loud and unevenly.</p><p>But Yuya just kneels down in front of him, head lowered.</p><p>“I’m sorry about the last time we had sex,” Yuya says awkwardly. “I was pretty rough on your body.”</p><p>Yuto almost laughs, remembering how he had dropped off painkillers the next day. “Just a little, but it was good though,” he says, not expecting an apology. “You don’t have to be sorry, I didn’t mind it. In fact I loved it.”</p><p>Is that why Yuya seemed so gentle with him ever since?</p><p>Yuya looks at him, relieved. “Really? But still, I want to formally apologize.” He bows his head low again. “I shouldn’t have shown up at your house in the first place since you rejected my advances beforehand,” he rises but keeps his eyes to the side. “Sometimes I get too in my head and let my emotions out on others,” he pauses before muttering under his breath, “Got scolded <em>twice</em>."</p><p>“Thank you for apologizing,” Yuto nods slowly, surprised by this. “But what do you mean by emotions?”</p><p>“When you brought up…" he bites his lip. "Inoo.”</p><p><em> There it is</em>, Yuto thinks to himself. "Do you not like Inoo?" He asks straightforwardly.</p><p>Ironic considering Yuya got upset when Yuto glared at Ryosuke.</p><p>Yuya seems conflicted. "I saw you two together.”</p><p>“Eh? You did?”</p><p>“At the clothes store, so when you said he helped you pick out your shirt,” he sighs. “My emotions got over me because I was…” he sucks in his bottom lip. “Jealous,” he pauses. “I was jealous he got to be with you and not me, so after getting rejected I thought maybe you would be with him again because I'm not good enough,” he runs a hand through his hair with a forced chuckle. “And before I knew it I was at your house. Dumb, I know, right?”</p><p>Yuto shakes his head, too shocked to speak. Jealous? Of Inoo? Being with him? “It’s not dumb, I just said I was jealous of you having friends too… and you’re pretty amazing in ways that I’m not.” he remembers how Yuya didn’t seem confident in himself at the beach.</p><p>“Yeah but, I only saw you two briefly but I could tell that you two were… close friends,” he says somewhat bitterly. “The way you acted around each other was casual and it looked like you both were having fun. I wanted that instead of being on the sidelines, wanted you to myself.”</p><p>Yuya's pouring some of his heart out and if Yuto wasn’t sure if he might've had feelings for Yuya, he’s pretty sure of it now. Friends or dating, he’s not sure what exactly he feels but there’s <em> something</em>.</p><p>And it’s <em> mutual</em>?</p><p>“Inoo and I have known each other for a long time, it’s only natural we’d be close friends,” he pauses. “I think… I think you and I have something a little different than that,” he tests the waters, not completely convinced Yuya feels the same way.</p><p>The older eyes him. “The closest I have to that is Yamada, and the guy lives in video games,” they both chuckle. Yuya’s voice becomes softer. “It’s only made me realize I wanted to spend that kind of time with you too.”</p><p>“I think I’d be happy with that,” Yuto smiles, glad when Yuya gives him a smile back.</p><p>It fills Yuto up with warmth, soothing his worries about his overthinking about what he truly wanted from Yuya. Now, he thinks he at least has a clue as to what that is, remembering a sparkling Yuya, smiling and laughing at everything.</p><p>Yuya straightens his back, clearing his throat. "Don't get me wrong though," he says in a lower tone, the switch sending a crawl over Yuto’s skin. "I really do love the sex we have together, some of the best I've had."</p><p>Yuto's heart speeds up, the Yuya he's familiar with now in front of him. "You're a pretty good fuck I have to admit."</p><p>“So yeah,” Yuya pushes back his hair. “It was wrong of me act possessive like that, even if you wanted it, you deserve more than that,” he says slowly. “You deserve to be made love to.”</p><p>The last bit tugs at Yuto’s chest, Yuya is implying what he thinks he is? With Yuya’s eyes on him, he finds his body reacting, becoming excited at the look and mere words.</p><p>Yuya has always had this mesmerizing magic effect on him.</p><p>“You ever made love to anyone before?” Yuto says carefully.</p><p>Yuya blinks a few times before shaking his head slowly. “But that’s why…” he scoots closer, resting his palms on top of Yuto’s thighs, Yuto’s heart rate spiking. “I’d like to make things up to you,” he says in a deep voice that reverberates in Yuto’s bones. “I wanna make sure you feel good.”</p><p>Yuto’s stomach tightens at the position of Yuya below him with dark, gorgeous eyes. “And how would you– do that?” he asks breathily.</p><p>“Like…” Yuya gently pushes his legs apart, easily settling in between. “This.” he looks up at him, Yuto's breath catching in his throat. Yuya leisurely places a trail of kisses along each leg, repeating with his inner thighs as they begin to tremble under his touch. “Yuto,” he says in his attractive, gravelly voice. “Will you teach me how to make love to you?”</p><p>Holy. Fucking. Shit.</p><p>Yuto pulls Yuya up without a word, the latter about to complain but Yuto tilts his head, pressing their lips together. Yuya rushes to deepen it but Yuto pulls away, shaking his head. “Just enjoy it.” Yuya pouts but nods, leaning in again, soft and sensual touches of lips with pokes of teasing tongues only to taste and feel each others’ lips. He tastes a bit like his dinner, but with the extra underlying natural smokey taste he’s quite familiar with, it only makes him taste better, able to leisurely enjoy it compared to the fast action they're used to. He laces a hand through Yuya’s long hair, gently scratching his scalp and swirling the locks between his fingers, loving how he sighs against his lips.</p><p>It all feels so good, so right. As if their lips were made to fit and touch each other, leave each other with tingles all over.</p><p>Before the kiss can deepen, Yuya pulls away, dropping back to his knees and kissing his thighs again, palming his crotch. “Allow me to suck you,” he says huskily. “Please.”</p><p>“Yuya…” he breathes out, nodding. “You haven’t blown me before, right?”</p><p>Yuya scrunches up his nose. “I’ve been greedy,” he murmurs. “Using your body and not caring for you enough…” Yuto groans as Yuya slips off his pants while maintaining eye contact, letting out his half hard cock. “I should’ve done this a long time ago, should’ve focused on your pleasure too.”</p><p>He’s embarrassed he’s gotten like this just from kissing and a bit of touching, but Yuya eyes him and just from that more blood rushes South. "Just you being in my presence gives me more than enough pleasure." Yuya's eyes sparkle at his words before leaning in, tonguing his balls, mouthing his shaft and finally wrapping his lips around the tip to swirl his tongue around, the visuals and slow sensations growing more and more until he’s fully hard within no time.</p><p>“You’re so hard,” Yuya mutters, licking a stripe up his length and rubbing his frenulum. “I never took the time to look at and feel you.”</p><p>“I’m not mad about that,” he blushes as Yuya’s tongue follows up each vein to memorize him. “Ah– Yuya–!” he moans as Yuya takes more of him into his mouth, bobbing his head slowly with hollowed cheeks. Yuto gently tugs his head to take him in further, exploring his wet, hot mouth with his cock, soft walls cushioning his sensitive head.</p><p>Yuya pops off him, tucking his hair behind his ears as he licks his lips, red and wet. “You taste good,” he places soft kisses along his length and around his head, making Yuto twitch with each one. “This is good for you?” he asks, Yuto nodding with a noise of confirmation because he can’t trust his voice. “Good.” he takes him back into his mouth, taking him deeper than before, rubbing against the roof of his mouth as his tongue glides along the underside of his cock.</p><p>The way Yuya is giving himself to him causes Yuto to throw his head back, stomach squeezing in familiar ways whenever he’s with him. “Yuya– wait I’m going– going to–” he groans as Yuya continues bobbing his head, squeezing and lapping at his slit to collect precome. Yuya's dark eyes glare at him and he knows what he’s trying to say without words.</p><p><em> Come for me</em>.</p><p>Yuto pushes Yuya off just before he comes despite needing only a few more strokes, hips twitching up to complete. “I want you inside me, Yuya,” he whines when Yuya tries to get him back into his mouth. “I want to come from your cock in my ass.”</p><p>The hands on his thighs tighten. “Yuto…” he swallows. Yuto doesn’t get to say anything else as Yuya scoops him up, yelping at how easily he picks him up bridal style, leaving him speechless.</p><p>With a quick kiss on the lips, he carries him, gently placing him down on the bed rather than tossing him. They help remove each other’s clothes, hands fumbling trying to multitask touching skin and clothes, taking longer to do than usual with their need to connect lips together, Yuya's being slightly salty with his own taste and swollen against his. Yuya’s mouth drops down, kissing his neck, his chest, his abdomen, anywhere he can, tasting every bit of him. When he tries to get his cock back into his mouth, Yuto pushes him away despite how much he wants it.</p><p>“I said I want to come from your cock, not your mouth,” his eye twitches.</p><p>Yuya laughs heartily. “I know, but after one taste,” he licks his lips. “I can’t resist you, Yuto, it's not fair."</p><p>Breaking away with that, Yuya grabs the lube and pours some over his fingers, teasing Yuto’s rim, poking and slowly circling the muscle. Right as Yuto starts to tell him to hurry, Yuya slowly pushes it in and out. With another finger in, Yuya can better massage his walls, curling his fingers to try finding his prostate. “Ah!” Yuto cries out, arching his back when he finds it, Yuya thrusting in a third finger and focusing on his sweet spot. “Yuuuyaaa~” he moans, finding it easy to relax his muscles, loving the feeling of Yuya controlling his body with his fingers, the slow build of pleasure bringing him close again.</p><p>“Yuto…” Yuya breathes out with a hard thrust. “Can I put my dick inside you yet?”</p><p>Yuto giggles at his impatience, not realizing he was waiting for his signal. “Yeah, please do.”</p><p>Yuya had his fingers out at “yeah”, eagerly slathering extra lube onto his cock and positioning himself at Yuto’s hole. He waits until Yuto nods again. “Oh, fuck,” they both moan as Yuya slides in, almost collapsing on top of him when he’s fully inside. “Yuto…” he leans down to kiss his lips, letting him adjust to his size as they melt together with the shared intense heat wrapping around the both of them, indulging in his rich, heavenly scent. "Oh my God, Yuto.”</p><p>“You feel, so fucking good, Yuya,” Yuto moans as Yuya pulls back to the tip and slowly back in until his balls press against his ass, making sure Yuto feels how each and every bit of Yuya fills him up, intimately connecting their bodies, their souls. “Oh, God, keep– keep going, more,” Each slow but deep thrust sends a rush of intense pleasure through his body, lighting him up from the curling of his toes to the top of his head. It makes him want more, crave more, the excitement of release heightening.</p><p>“Yuto, fuck,” he speeds up, keeping a steady rhythm that drives Yuto closer the promised land of paradise. “Do you– do you feel good?”</p><p>“Fucking amazing,” Yuto responds without his brain telling his mouth to move, too focused on the pleasure Yuya is giving him. “I love this, love this so much, keep going,” he gets out, gripping the sheets beneath him to help ground him from losing himself.</p><p>“I like when you do this,” Yuya exhales, covering one of his hands with his larger warm one. “It’s so damn attractive, you’re so fucking beautiful, Yuto,” he says in the deep voice that Yuto could never hear enough of. “Everything you do, everything you are… Fuck.”</p><p>His words almost make him come right there, eyes squeezed shut. Yuya usually whispers sweet nothings in his ear, but he can’t help but think that these words are coming from his heart this time, burrowing deep into him. Yuto is too close, too fast. But after the blowjob and the fingering, his body can’t handle all the buildup, smoke so close to the edge of the sky. He reaches up to cup Yuya’s face, so perfectly fitting in his hands.</p><p>“Yuya, make me come,” he smiles. "You damn handsome man."</p><p>Yuya stops his movements in surprise, but slowly grins. “Oh, I will.”</p><p>Yuya wraps his hand around Yuto’s cock, stroking it in time with his quick thrusts, Yuto clenching down when he pushes in.</p><p>They've done this countless times, yet this is the first where their bodies roll together in a synced dance, combining together as one being, one heart, one life. They're sharing their pleasure, guiding each other's climb to the top, chasing their highs together rather than individually.</p><p>And it's fucking fantastic.</p><p>With one last cry of Yuya’s name, Yuto falls into pure bliss as their pleasure blossoms out, resonating throughout his body, fueling him up with lustrous vitality. Yuya follows soon, pushing deep into him, Yuto whining with his cock twitching inside. Waves of ecstasy rush though him as he tumbles down from the stars and clouds, grasping onto Yuya as they fall into a cushion of sweet flowers waiting for them, more intense knowing that Yuya is in the same position, experiencing their pots of gold together.</p><p>Euphoria.</p><p>Yuya collapses on top of him, pressing their foreheads together, glassy eyes gazing into each other as they catch their breaths. Arms are wrapped around the other, holding on tight, unwilling to let go for if they do they’ll float apart while elated.</p><p>When Yuya starts to carefully massage his body, Yuto closes his eyes, completely safe in these gentle arms. When he reopens them, his breath is stolen at how Yuya looks at him with genuine affection, spreading an inferno through him as Yuya beams brighter than the Summer sun, spreading more heat through him. His eyes are different from the lust that usually pierces through his soul, gentle warmth and fervor branching throughout his body. It invigorates him, heals him, gives him an even stronger breath of life.</p><p>The seed Yuya planted inside Yuto long ago is no longer just a bud, absorbing their passion and flourishing, blooming to let a rush of trapped emotions and feelings run loose.</p><p><em> Oh</em>. So that's it.</p><p>“That was…” Yuya starts, lost for words.</p><p>“Fucking amazing,” Yuto finishes, looking away first for his heart begins to overflow.</p><p>Yuya nods, blinking slowly with a smile. They both help each other get dressed while exchanging soft kisses on different body parts. “I like making love to you,” Yuya says gently, capturing Yuto’s hand, raising it to kiss it. “But I’d like to do more with you and get to know you better, like shop and eat more meals.” Yuto’s heart skips a beat, wanting to scream that he agrees but Yuya continues, rubbing comforting circles on his hand with his thumb. “And go on drives, to the movies, to the sea and take photos with you. I want to experience life together. Just… everything.”</p><p>Everything sounds so simple, so easy, yet each idea strokes Yuto’s heart, leaving him in great anticipation, wanting to do anything with Yuya. "Don't tell me this is a confession?"</p><p>Yuya flusters with a hint of pink on his cheeks. "I– I don’t know. I don't do this kind of stuff.”</p><p>Yuto finds it adorable. “Good. I can't wait for us to do all those things and get to know each other more so I can show you how to properly confess,” he beams, knocking him down in a hug. Yuya is surprised with the force at first, but wraps his arms around him just as tight. “I’m so glad we found each other again to be together like this.”</p><p>It’s been years since that one night stand in college, not expecting to ever see Yuya again. Yet here Yuto is now, ready to spend more days and nights with Takaki Yuya.</p><p>“You’re the first person I’ve ever had a strong desire to stay with, you came and took my breath away,” Yuya squeezes him, cupping Yuto’s face and tilting it towards him. “Is this fate,” he smiles, teeth flashing as he gingerly places a kiss on his lips. “Or destiny?”</p><p>How did he get this fortunate?</p><p>Yuto grins. “Whatever it is, I love it.”</p><p>They hold each other for a little longer, relishing in each other’s warmth and comfort.</p><p>“Oh right, I got you something,” Yuya says quietly, not moving right away.</p><p>Yuto whines when Yuya finally pulls away, watching as he rushes out. He comes back with the unknown bag from earlier, carefully placing it down in front of Yuto, motioning him to open it. He does, eyes widening as he finds… a small pot of purple bloomerang lilacs. “You…”</p><p>“You looked like you liked them, so I went to buy some,” he says bashfully. “I didn't think a bouquet would be enough… Cheesy, I know.”</p><p>Yuto hugs the pot, soft flowers tickling his chin, thrilled he remembered that small moment. “Cheesy or not, I love them. I promise to take care of them,” he looks at Yuya. “And also,” he grins. “Let me take care of you too.”</p><p>Yuya stiffens, shaking his head. “Wait, it should be in the script that once you say you’ll take care of the flowers, I say <em> I’ll </em> take care of <em> you,</em>" he gives him an utterly adorable pout.</p><p>Yuto laughs. “What script? Is this a shoujou manga?"</p><p>"I'm pretty sure I read one like that?"</p><p>How cute of him. "I want to spoil you too sometimes.” he gives him a light punch while tucking a piece of his hair behind his ear, amused at Yuya's confusion as his hands motion between the two actions.</p><p>Yuya is fun to tease… he cannot wait to spend more time with this man.</p><p>After finding the perfect spot for Yuto’s new flowers to thrive, Yuto takes out his camera to take photos of it, teaching Yuya how he does it. Yuya's face when Yuto flicks some settings without looking and effortlessly making the flowers' colors pop beautifully?</p><p>Priceless.</p><p>With the camera out, Yuto fulfills his promise to show Yuya his collection of flowers he’s taken over the years, pausing on each one to point out and admire each of their beauties.</p><p>Pale white orchards, radiant golden sunflowers, cacti with fiery red bulbs.</p><p>Each so different, yet beautiful in their own way. Some make a home lively and comfortable with fresh, bright greenery. Some have soft, sweet fragrances, given to those you love. Some have intense colors while others are dull. Some even have sharp thorns, ready to pierce through skin.</p><p>All different kinds and if you give it some time to get to know it and allow it to fully bloom rather than focusing on first impressions, you’ll fall in love with the right one. The flowers with thorns covering the stem may deter you at first and give you some pain, but looking past them you’ll find a sweet, lovely flower waiting to be loved and cherished.</p><p>Yuto looks up at Yuya admiring the pink rose on his camera with a gleaming smile he’s never seen on him before, automatically moving to snap a photo of him.</p><p>“What was that for?” he flushes. “I look gross.”</p><p>“You’re gorgeous,” Yuto beams, marveling at the photo. “Like a flower.”</p><p>People are just like flowers. Take time to care for them right and they'll flourish in your heart.</p>
