<div id="chapters" class="userstuff">
    <h2 class="toc-heading">you know me best</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>"You like it black, right?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You do? That's such an old man's drink!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yabu laughed and Takaki only snorted at him, saying that's rich coming from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But honestly though! I thought you liked it sweet?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Take my card instead," Takaki said, instead of answering the other, smiling up at Yamada who only shrugged, taking his card.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm having a caramel macchiato!" Nakajima said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The same for me! And a cupcake!" Inoo added, and another and another until Yuya realized he's going to buy all of them a drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Y'all should pay for your own drinks!" Yamada giggled, looking to gauge Takaki's reaction. "You can't keep on freeloading off Takaki's card."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm freeloading off yours. Buy me strawberry cream frappe," Chinen replied, making the table break into laughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"You like yours spicy, right?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah I - thanks, Yama-chan," Takaki smiled, sitting next to the man, apologizing to the rest of the table for being late. Basically, he was on time for the food's arrival but late for the meeting time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Be thankful Yama-chan knew what you liked or you'd be waiting while we eat," Yaotome pointed out and Takaki nodded, turning a grateful smile Yamada's way. He didn't see it but the younger man blushed and had to bow his head to hide it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ah, the things we do," Yuri sing-songed, looking at Yamada meaningfully although the rest of the table didn't really catch it. Maybe Inoo but then the man doesn't really like assuming anything unless it's very obvious it's comical.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ain't that right, Chii," he only said, exchanging looks with him and Ryosuke's suddenly sure there's another one in Yuri's little 'Support Yamada' club.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"I got everyone snacks," Takaki cheered as he put the big bag of snacks down on the table. "I can't find that one you like so I got something similar." Takaki said, turning to Yabu.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Aw. They're always out in the vendo here," The man pouted but smiled all the same when he saw what Takaki got him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"How about you? I don't see anything for you here." Yamada asked, going through the remaining contents of the bag, looking at Yuya curiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll take whatever's left," Yuya shrugged, taking a peek inside the baggie, almost groaning when he saw they were snacks he didn't really like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Right..." the other trailed off before disappearing, only to return with something Yuya does like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How'd you know I like this one?" The man excitedly asked, opening the packet and getting a mouthful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because you know what I like," Yamada simply shrugged and left the man alone wondering.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yama-chan knows me the best," Takaki grinned cheerfully when asked, putting an arm around the other who was thankful for the full coverage foundation he was made to wear. That at least helped hide his blush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He always knows the things I like and makes sure there's always something for me in everything."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sounds more like a boyfriend to me," Chinen murmured on Takaki's other side but the man only laughed, putting an arm around him too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If only, right? I'd be the happiest man,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you weren't dense then you could be," Chinen only grumbled before shrugging his arm off, moving next to Inoo who was trying his best to hold his laughter back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's up with that guy?"</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>"You still haven't told Chinen?" Yuya asked once the two of them were left alone. "The guy's always on the verge of popping a nerve around me,"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's him secretly having fun," Yamada chuckled. "Also, it would help if you stop pretending like we're not together."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop acting like you have an unrequited crush on me first," Takaki laughed. "We both know that was my situation before."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Was it really unrequited if we're together?" Yamada asked and Yuya only grinned smugly.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
