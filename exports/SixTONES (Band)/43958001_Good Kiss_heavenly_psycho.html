<div class="userstuff">
  <p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Birds are chirping when Yugo opens his eyes. He is feeling, for the first time in a long time, light and content. He turns around toward the warmth that had been wrapping him all night and sees dark strands of hair hiding Jesse’s sleepy face. Instinctively, Yugo traces a thumb over his frail eyelid and across his soft cheek. Jesse is still deep in sleep, he has always been a heavy sleeper, Yugo suspects that alcohol just knocks him out.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As usual, his moment of sempiternal bliss is cut short at the dreading sound of a ringing phone.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">It immediately awoke Yugo who sits up and grabs his phone on the nightstand. It is already 10 AM and he had a schedule two hours ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He never oversleeps that late.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Hello? I’m so sorry, Yuu-nii, I—“ Yugo says, completely panicked as he also looks around him to remember where he was.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Kouchi-san?! I was dead worried! Are you alright?! You did not answer, I kept knocking on your door, but since no one answered, I ended up opening the door of your place with my key, I am so sorry for intruding and finding out you were not home…” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo does not know how to justify himself, he does not know where to begin, apologize profusely or lying his ass off about his location? They know they are not very subtle but they would like to keep it for themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I—“</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Are you at Jesse-san’s?” He asks hurriedly, and it is a blessing from the sky that his manager does not get to see a flush spreading across his face. “I assumed, since you’re answering my call from Jesse-san’s phone…”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo pulls the phone away from his ear to stare at the object in his hand, a bright red case and the screensaver of a cute dog. “Why did you call <em>him</em>?” Yugo almost yells at the poor manager as he jumps out of the bed.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I didn’t know who else to call… and he’s the closest person to you that I know except your mother.” His manager admits, becoming as bashful as Yugo. “I’ll pick you up and won’t tell anyone, so please, tell me where you are. I already waived our fees, but—”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I’ll go there by myself, you join me there.” Yugo tells him, as he looks for new clothes in Jesse’s dressing room across the room. Everything Jesse wears is always too big on him, he would look ridiculous so he did bring a pile of fresh clothes he always leaves in a corner of his dressing room but Jesse always ends up putting it away with his own clothes so Yugo has to look for his own clothes amongst Jesse’s, making him lose so much time.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I prepared your clothes in the bathroom already…” a sleepy voice tells Yugo. “You said you had to wake up early so I did it before goinvnfjlds—” Jesse is mumbling as he fights against his drowsiness. Yugo remembers falling asleep early yesterday, waiting for Jesse to come to bed but Jesse was out very late and came back at three, waking Yugo in the process and for some obscure reason, the alcohol, the fresh air or the sleepiness got forgotten for a late hour of slow sex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">That was a bad idea, since he did not hear his alarm. Or maybe he dozed off — either way Yugo does not remember but he is freaking out so much right now he does not have the time to think.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo runs around the place, moving about the dressing room or the bathroom while Jesse slowly and sloppily brought himself to the kitchen to prepare a smoothie and coffee for he and Yugo. But Yugo is late and does not even acknowledge Jesse as he dashes towards the door to slip into his shoes.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Still anchored by the laziness of an early morning, Jesse follows him to give him a smoothie but Yugo refuses.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I don’t have time to drink it, I’m sorry…”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Okay, it’s fine. It’s my fault you’re late.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Don’t worry. I’m going, then.” Yugo says as he opens the door. He stops in his movements and says: “I’m forgetting something, didn’t I?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo turns around at the same time Jesse stepped forward to give him a soft and small coffee flavored kiss on the lips.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You forgot to kiss me goodbye, yes.” Jesse whispers against his lips, their foreheads touching, making them forget all about time again.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo chuckles quietly, as if he was not already two hours late. He would have gotten mad if he was not in such a good mood. “I meant my helmet… I forgot it in the living room, can you get it for me? I already have my shoes on…”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As asked, Jesse skips swiftly to get Yugo’s helmet left on the table of the living room. When Jesse comes back a few seconds later to hand his helmet over, he leans over to kiss Yugo on the top of his head.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“This is a good luck kiss for today.” Jesse declares with a slight smile. Yugo knows Jesse is sad to see him leave, even if it is work, he always has this face when he fears upcoming loneliness, so he fills space and silence as much as he can, whenever he can. But together, they have always felt complete.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo also kisses him on his jaw, feeling his unshaven stubble prickle the sensitive skin of his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">They look at each other as if they could see planets beyond the stars in their eyes.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Aren’t you late? You should go or we will never stop kissing. Yuu-nii is going to have a heart attack if you never show up.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo taps on his shoulder, he was right, he thought.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Ok, I’m going!”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Take care.” Jesse answers as the door closes but his phone immediately pings in his pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He takes it out and reads the new incoming messages.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">(2) NEW NOTIFICATIONS</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yuu-nii:</p><p class="p1" align="justify">(8:01) <em>Please, tell me Kouchi-san left already…<br/>

  <p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">It’s freezing so much that Yugo’s feet are extremely cold. He wakes up hungry, angry and cold. Not a good way to start his morning. It’s been forever since he and Jesse had a day off so they could have this trip they kept talking about for so long. Unfortunately, it’s been snowing so hard outsides that it’s not advised for them to go out. Yugo wants to cry when he sees the snow, not because it’s pretty, but because it wrecks their plans and he hates the cold. Also, he again has to be confined between the four wall of this hotel. It reminds him of dark times during which he had to spend it alone. But at least, this time, he gets to be confined with Jesse.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I hate the snow…” Yugo complains as he pulls the blanket a bit further above his head, and pulled himself closer to Jesse’s body. He loves how he’s always warm no matter what. He who’s always so easily cold only has to snuggle against Jesse to get warmer. He wraps his arms and his legs around Jesse’s bigger body, sliding his feet under Jesse’s shirt so his skin could warm up his cold feet.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">In this position, he is ready to go back to sleep but Jesse nudges him gently.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Let’s go to the sauna and the onsen, there should be no one at this time.” Jesse suggests, but the cold weather makes Yugo incredibly sleepy. He barely moves at the suggestion that would have perked him up usually, but not today.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Sleepy.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Huh, you’re sleepy? Then let me wake you up.” Jesse says as he chuckles against his hair, kissing it so tenderly that Yugo’s eyes suddenly flutter and open up.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Damn you.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Awake?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Kinda.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Jesse smiles at him and gives a kiss on his lips. But when Jesse’s tongue peeks through, Yugo starts to feel the hair on his body stand on end and soon, coldness is replaced by a heat that Jesse gladly provides through his touch as his body slowly moves on its own against him.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“It’s snowing,” Yugo comments randomly as his eyes fall on the falling snow behind Jesse. It’s pure, calm and extremely sad. But when he watches Jesse ignite in front of him, he feels more than awake and warmer than he had expected. Jesse stopped staring at Yugo, stopped kissing him and stopped moving against his body to turn towards the snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Yeah.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Let’s take it easy today.” Yugo suggests, still sore from the night before. Jesse doesn’t even complain. Instead, he asks:</p><p class="p2" align="justify">
  <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Awake?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Yes. I can’t resist your kisses, can I?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He laughs audibly before helping Yugo get up so they can get breakfast.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I’m irresistible.” He jokes as he reaches out for Yugo’s hand.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Yeah,” Yugo agrees. He watches Jesse’s back, it had grown bigger, better, higher recently. Yugo<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>decides to slip his arms around Jesse, their hands finding each other. When Yugo kisses the back of his nape and nuzzles his nose against it, he mumbles: “Yeah, you are.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p>
