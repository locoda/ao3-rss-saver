  <span>Prologue</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much for this plant potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga had been attending his yard sale for the whole day. He was tired from standing and hadn't gotten a chance to eat since breakfast, and the sun was nearly setting now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, just take it,” he replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked over to see what was left and picked up a book. Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami. This book was one of his favourites. He turned to Ms. Yamada, who would be buying the estate from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was a pleasure doing business with you”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Taiga Kyomoto filled out the final pieces of paperwork, he looked around at his inn. It was still breathtaking. He wished he could’ve lived here forever, but he was getting old, he couldn't keep up with repairs, and he wished for a new life. As he handed the paperwork back to the new owner he heard her exclaim, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love your sweater! Where did you get it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-'' Taiga falters, searching for an answer, “I’m sorry I don't remember.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Made with soft purple wool, the sweater was well-worn and cozy, and it smelled like the sun. He wore it almost everyday, but since he’d promised himself he’d begin a new life and leave everything behind, he offered Mrs. Yamada if she would like to have it, either for herself or her children. He felt a twinge of sadness taking it off to give to her, but it was just a sweater, right? He looked at the horizon where the crescent moon had begun to appear. By this time tomorrow, Taiga would be across the world, back in Japan to right his wrongs. To new beginnings, he thought to himself, and he went back to the inn to finish the last of his packing. </span>

  <p>Chapter 1</p><p>8 AM</p><p>
  <em>“The one I'll give my mornings to”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga woke up to a crisp March morning and stretched his arms. He looked out the window and saw that the sun had only just begun to rise, casting a warm glow into the room. He headed downstairs to turn on the generator. The occupants were asleep, so Taiga scurried back into his bed and checked his phone. As usual, he had spotty service and decided to walk to the town to check if he had received any important emails.</p><p>“Another day, the same routine Anzu."</p><p>Upon hearing his name, the dog leaped up on the bed and snuggled into the warmth of the blankets.</p><p>“Oh come on you big baby, let's go for a walk.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook off the cold and grabbed his hoodie and the leash from the top of the dresser. It was still dawn, and if he hurried he could finish his walk in time to make breakfast for the Tanakas. As soon as he clipped the leash on Anzu, the dog yanked him out, eager to walk in the spring sun. Anzu sped up to a jog, and Taiga followed his lead. Taiga loved his morning runs, it was peaceful and he savoured every second of peace.</p><p> </p><p> Growing up with a celebrity dad was anything but peaceful. Media appearances and frequent stage plays meant his dad had a packed schedule and had no time to be a dad. His dad loved him, he knew this, but when all the other children had their parents chaperoning field trips and helping out at book fairs, Taiga couldn't help but feel disconnected and out of place. Taiga hated being in the spotlight. It was one of the reasons that led him to run an inn. Nestled by the sea, the inn was far from the city and had few occupants, which meant he could spend all day crafting, gardening, and doing repairs around the estate. After a couple laps of light jogging and a trip to the farmer’s market, Anzu decided he was tired and pulled Taiga back to the inn. He let Anzu off his leash and headed to the kitchen. It was the Tanaka family’s last day at the inn and he prepared a special array of local fruits, jams, and freshly baked bread. He left it out in the servery for the guests to collect, as well as some tomatoes from his greenhouse and a handmade card as a gift of gratitude. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>“I hope you enjoyed your stay at the Solanum Inn, please come again. Thank you.”</p><p>With the Tanakas gone, the inn suddenly felt empty and quiet. Taiga got to work, starting with his daily routine in the greenhouse. He began by watering plants, mixing new soil, and clipping dead leaves. An hour or so had passed when Taiga noticed a lean figure standing outside of the greenhouse. Taiga wasn’t expecting any more new visitors. He quickly wiped his dirty hands on his pants and led the man to the main building with the reception desk.</p><p>“Hi, I’m Taiga Kyomoto. How can I help you?”</p><p>To which the man replied,</p><p>“Is this your inn?”</p><p>The man was bundled in a large coat and a suitcase. He looked weary.</p><p>“Yes! Welcome to the Solanum Inn, how long will you be staying with us?” </p><p>“I’m not sure yet. A couple of weeks maybe.”</p><p>The man was strange. He had a handsome youthful face and his aura seemed familiar to Taiga. </p><p>“Wonderful.” Taiga continued, “ I would just like to inform you that we do not have stable cell reception, and the lights cut out at 11 pm, but we have generators in case of emergencies. I hope that isn't too much of an inconvenience.”</p><p>“No, it's fine, I just needed to get away,” the man replied.</p><p>Taiga wondered what that meant. The man was cold and reserved. He didn't say any more than he needed to and kept his answers short. </p><p>“Oh! I’m sorry.” Taiga said. “Could I get a name for the transaction?”</p><p>“Hokuto Takatsuki.”</p><p>Did he hesitate? Perhaps Taiga imagined it. </p><p>He continued to tell Hokuto about meal schedules, popular tourist attractions, and a quick overview of the town, but the man seemed tired, so Taiga led him up to his room and left him to unpack.  </p><p> </p><p>That night, Hokuto didn't show for dinner. Taiga waited for a while, but gave up and put the food into the fridge and left out a note on the counter saying that Hokuto could eat the meal, and started to clean dishes. </p><p>Hokuto was probably sleeping. The man seemed tired when he came in this afternoon, and Taiga didn't want to impose on his privacy. He walked down the hall to his own room where Anzu was curled fast asleep on his bed. Taiga pulled the blankets over his head and tried to sleep. He couldn't shake Hokuto Takatsuki from his head. He seemed so familiar. He seemed like someone Taiga should know, a childhood friend, someone he should know inside and out. He couldn't quite put his finger on it. The man was odd. He decided to try and talk to him in the next couple of days. If Hokuto was spending a couple weeks at the inn, Taiga would try and befriend him. And on that resolution, Taiga fell asleep.</p><p>
