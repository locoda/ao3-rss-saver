<h1>A Dance with Fate</h1>
<div class="byline">by Anonymous</div>
<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>There are three things Hokuto often think about.<br/>First, who is behind the private Twitter account that QRT'd all his tweets and bid him goodbye on the first day of 2024?<br/>Second, are the characters from Taiga's script based on real people? And if it is, who are they?<br/>And third, why did Taiga beg him to leave him alone - after he kissed him?</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>- Taiga's "Mozart" is finally here! So happy he gets to fulfill one of his dreams 🫰💗 I wasn't planning on uploading this yet, but I installed Twitter again and saw Taiga's tweet about Hokuto and I just have to! 💗🖤<br/>- As tagged, this is loosely-inspired by the Korean drama "Lovely Runner" and plot-wise, I'll be mostly using, expanding, and playing with the last few episodes of the drama. I'm not in the mood to write cutesy high school romance so let's all jump to the angst-filled adult romance.<br/>- BTW, I've started writing this right after Shintaro's bday and I'm just shook that Hokuto's upcoming movie has time-travel and time-altering element. Love the timing and coincidence!<br/>- This fic contains embbeded images of fake tweets, I've added a text quote in case the images won't show and for the blind who used text-to-speech reading software.</p></blockquote>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Being typecast is probably career suicide to every actor serious about their craft, and in Hokuto’s case, he is not just inundated with drama roles, he also has to perish in every one of them. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His last movie, “Moving” was a commercial and critical success. He portrayed a single father stricken with ALS, who only had a few months to find a new family for his daughter. He loved the movie, he loved his character, and he loved how it moved a lot of people. His career really took off. He got nominated for the Japan Academy Prize, and he got brand endorsements left and right, but he didn’t like the movie offers that followed. So instead of striking while the iron is hot, he decided to take a break from movies. He hoped to detach himself from his most famous role yet completely. He went overseas and took a short course about filmmaking, but as his agency announced his comeback, the offers remained the same. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It has been a year. Why do people still want to see me die?” Hokuto complained during the meeting with his manager and agent. His agency has received a dozen scripts from different production companies since they hinted at his return. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You’re a very good <em> dier </em> – if that’s a word,” quipped Kochi, his long-time agent since he joined the agency, <em> Type AB </em>.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I don’t mind doing any genre as long as I live,” he added, while he checked another script titled, “Signal”.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I scanned that one. It’s a police drama with elements of time-altering,” said Jesse, his manager. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He opened the script with interest. “I’ve always wanted to be in a <em> deka </em> drama.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It’s open-ending, but it's pretty much given you died,” added Jesse and the script immediately went to the reject pile.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I want it clear that I'm alive. How about this one…'The One That Got Away’?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“That’s a fantasy,” said Kochi disapprovingly. “I’m not really a fan.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Really? I thought it was a romcom from the title, but do I get to live though?” He asked as he riffled the pages. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You will,” said Jesse with a grin, “But you will die three times first, but because it’s a fantasy, you still get to live.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His face fell another script landing on the reject pile. “Sounds complicated.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You want romcom? How about this one? You’ll be playing a widowed father and you live next to a woman who doesn’t do housework,” Kochi suggested. “Do you want to try it?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He took the script from Kochi and read the logline. “I’ll give it a read, I like the change.” His phone’s alarm rang, and he panicked seeing he had entered the wrong time. He had a date at 6: 30 in the evening, but he set the alarm exactly at 6: 30.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Shit! I need to go. I’m late.” He grabbed a bunch of scripts by his right side before he rushed to his waiting car. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He is late, and his girlfriend, Alice, will be livid. This wasn’t the first time he got late on their date because of work, and even during his short hiatus from work, he was still late most of the time. It was never his character to be late, he always valued his and others’ time. But he didn’t know why when it came to dating, time was never on his side. Something would always come up at the last minute. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You don’t have to wait for me, but will you drop these to my place on your way home?” He asked his driver, giving him the scripts he took earlier. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The French restaurant where Alice and he agreed to meet was full when he arrived, and he could only sigh in relief at seeing Alice was still there. It also seemed that she started eating ahead of him, a soup entrée was already on the table, and she was busy stirring her spoon until she saw him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I’m so-”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Drop it,” said Alice. She lost interest in the soup as she took a gulp of red wine. “It’s not like this is the first time. It got to the point I never expected you to arrive on time anyway.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He pursed his lips and sat across from her. “I was reading some scripts-” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Script, huh? I bet you’re looking for one where you remain alive?” Alice cuts in.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He was embarrassed to admit it. “Uhm, yeah.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You said you had this aversion to accepting roles where you would end up dying because you’ve dreamt numerous times that you died and it scares you.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto nodded. He never really liked “dying characters” and he only accepted “Moving” because he wasn’t getting any offers for a lead role. He seemed to be stuck in the cycle of the second male lead, the nice guy who never gets the girl, and a bunch of supporting characters. “Moving” was a game changer. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“But I’m sure you don’t regret taking that risk, right?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He nodded again. Dying in the movie launched him to stardom. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I guess you’d rather take the risk with work than me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The smile on his face froze. He guessed what they said about women was true; they were scarier when they were no longer angry. And what Alice said next cemented that.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Let’s free ourselves, Hokuto.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked quietly. He knew full well what it meant. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Let’s break up. Let’s end this.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He felt like his surroundings were paused, saved for his beating heart.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“This isn’t just about you being always late,” said Alice as though he read his mind, “But if you couldn’t even commit even a minute for me, I doubt you could commit a lifetime with me.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Alice dabbed a napkin on her lips and left him without so much of a glance. He watched his reflection on Alice’s wine glass and felt awful. He didn’t deserve Alice, because he felt relieved it was over than sad. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<em> “But if you couldn’t even commit at least one minute for me, I doubt you could commit a lifetime with me.” </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Time was never his problem, it was commitment. He might sound like he’s buttering his shortcomings, but he seems repulsed over two things. First is dying, and second is committing to a relationship. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He had no idea where everything stemmed from. Except for that event during high school, his life had been pretty laid back. He had no major heartbreaks. No near-death experiences. His mom passed away at childbirth, but his dad is alive and well. No drama with his friends. And his career has always been thriving. So where did his fear even begin?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He was so lost in thought; he didn’t realize he had arrived home. The pile of scripts was waiting by his kitchen counter along with a few mail, junk adverts, and a purple padded envelope. Frowning, he opened the envelope and found a purple iPhone. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Huh? Whose phone is this?” He checked the envelope for any address, but there was none. He tried to turn on the phone, but it remained dead, so he went to his charging ports until the green drip was on the screen. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He pressed the power on button, but he didn’t wait for it to fully turn on before he went to take a bath. He picked a script to read for bed until he fell asleep, and the purple iPhone was completely forgotten.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>If he remembered and checked the phone, he might have seen the lock screen change from an old photo of his to a generic wallpaper with the time set at 00:00 Jan 01, 2024. </p><p align="left"><br/>

</p><p>Riku, one of the senior writers of Panache Publishing where Taiga worked as a photographer, asked, "If some people are fated to meet, are there also people who are fated never to meet?" He, along with the other heads plus one team member of each division, were having their twice-monthly story conference. Everyone is expected to come up with themes and ideas for either “Jouhin” or “Virginia”, their monthly fashion magazine and quarterly literary magazine, respectively.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga couldn't understand why he had to drop ideas as well, especially when they consistently rejected all of his ideas for photoshoots due to "lack of vision," whatever that meant. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Interesting,” said Miranda, their overall editor-in-chief, whose name wasn’t really Miranda, but she wanted to pretend that her workplace was “The Devil Wears Prada” set. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What do you think of that, Taiga?” asked Miranda, and Taiga didn’t miss how Juri, their graphic artist, smirked at his predicament. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Is that an idea for a photoshoot theme?” He asked, just to refresh everyone’s memory that he is a photographer. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“No,” said Miranda with a cluck of her tongue, “But what do you think about it as a man? Fate is usually a drivel believed by most women, so I want a differing opinion.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga glanced at Riku, she looked uncomfortable, and Taiga had a hard time gauging whether Miranda was just setting up the table to shoot Riku’s idea down, or would his opinion be used for consideration.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He sighed and flicked his pen, choosing his words carefully. “I agree with Riku. I also think that some people are fated to meet, and some people are not. But I don’t like the romantic or even divine aspect they associate it with. After all, there is such a thing as ill fate. Strangers who were also fated to meet, but only to be each other's ruin. Or worse, demise. Wouldn’t it be nice if they never met at all?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>His answer was met with silence, everyone looked at him with awe as though it was the first time he ever talked sense in his 6 years of working for Panache. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Interesting,” said Miranda with one of her gloaty smiles, “I’m sure you could come up with a meaningful essay on that for our ‘<em>After Dinner Conversations</em>’ column in Virginia.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga was stumped. He didn’t really like writing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Miranda declared the meeting adjourned before he could protest and left the room with two of her overworked assistants. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“She’s a bitch,” Taiga complained as he and Juri walked to their pantry. “Remember when she made me fly to LA to shoot Ohtani Shohei? Then, I learned that we didn't even have an appointment, and I had to essentially act as a paparazzo. That’s the same level as ordering me to fucking write an essay.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You should have just played dumb,” said Juri as he put a Nespresso pod to the machine, “Instead of being a smart alec.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga groaned. “I thought she might reject Riku’s idea if I disagree or something. I didn’t think it would be my downfall.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The tantalizing smell of freshly pressed coffee wafted toward him and it was such a shame he didn’t drink coffee. Juri then opened the fridge and took out oolong tea. Printed on the bottle is the face of a famous frontman from the band <em>Eclipse</em>. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It’s not like you can’t write,” said Juri as he opened the tea for him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I can, but I won’t,” he argued and commented on the face of his drink. “He looks like he prefers energy drinks over tea.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What’s your point?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Nothing. Just thinking that fate works in mysterious ways.” He took a gulp of the oolong tea.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What’s this? Are you now mentally preparing for your essay?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He ignored Juri’s teasing and finished his drink. It was good, but he was too irritated to appreciate it. His phone buzzed, and he got more irritated. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Is this a scam?” He asked, showing Juri the message. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Juri reads, “Congratulations! Your script is now being considered being a full-length movie. We would like to invite you for a contract signing at our head office, 6-17-6 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo. For more details, please check your email. A copy of the contract has also been attached. Again, congratulations! We look forward to working with you.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What did you join?” asked Juri.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I didn’t join anything,” said Taiga, but deep inside, he wasn’t that confident with his memory. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“The address looks familiar. Let me search…” Juri took out his phone and after a few taps, he gasped, “...The address belongs to TAHO Studios.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga also gasped. “The TAHO Studios?” TAHO is one of the top film studios in Japan. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You sneaky bastard…they had a scriptwriting contest, and you won?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga was so confused. “I swear, I never joined anything. Do I look like I have scripts lying around?” As soon as he said that, cold sweat trickled down his back. He had a script saved on his laptop at home. He wrote it out of boredom and frustration. It was a story he didn’t want to see the light of day. It was strictly for his eyes only. It was his very own “ill fate”.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Amidst Juri’s scowls, Taiga excused himself to go back to his area and quickly checked his company and personal email. Both were clear. There were no emails from TAHO Studios, or any studios for that matter. He also checked his sent items up to six months back and he didn’t send anything to any studios. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He sighed in relief. The message was probably sent in error, so he composed a reply to clear the air. <em> “Hello. I think this message was sent by mistake. I didn’t join any contest, nor did I send any scripts.” </em> </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The reply came fast, and he quickly read, “Hi, this is TAHO Studios. Is this not Morimoto-san? We received your script titled ‘The One That Got Away’....” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<em> We received your script titled ‘The One That Got Away’... </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He dropped his phone before he could finish reading the message. Fear coursing through veins. “This must not happen,” he murmured. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Where are you going?” asked Juri when Taiga passed by the pantry. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga forced a smile, and Juri’s reaction told him he must have looked scary. “I’m going to kill my housemate.” </p><p> </p>
