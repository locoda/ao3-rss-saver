<h1>A Dance with Fate</h1>
<div class="byline">by Anonymous</div>
<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>After managing to avert tragedy and ultimately changing Hokuto's fate, Taiga quietly lives his life. Hokuto had no idea he existed, and Taiga was fine living with loneliness as long as Hokuto was safe. But the thread of fate proved to be unyielding as it only took a Twitter account and a script for Hokuto to untangle everything, and eventually open up Taiga's biggest fear of losing Hokuto again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>- Taiga's "Mozart" is finally here! So happy he gets to fulfill one of his dreams 🫰💗 I wasn't planning on uploading this yet, but I installed Twitter again and saw Taiga's tweet about Hokuto and I just have to! 💗🖤<br/>- As tagged, this is loosely-inspired by the Korean drama "Lovely Runner" and plot-wise, I'll be mostly using, expanding, and playing with the last few episodes of the drama. I'm not in the mood to write cutesy high school romance so let's all jump to the angst-filled adult romance.<br/>- BTW, I started writing this right after Shintaro's bday and I'm just shook that Hokuto's upcoming movie has time-travel and time-altering element. Love the timing and coincidence!<br/>- This fic contains embbeded images of fake tweets, I also added a text quote in case the images won't show and for the blind who used text-to-speech reading software/app.</p></blockquote>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Being typecast is probably career suicide to every actor serious about their craft, and in Hokuto’s case, he is not just inundated with drama roles, he also has to perish in every one of them. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His last movie, “Moving” was a commercial and critical success. He portrayed a single father stricken with ALS, who only had a few months to find a new family for his daughter. He loved the movie, he loved his character, and he loved how it moved a lot of people. His career really took off. He got nominated for the Japan Academy Prize, and he got brand endorsements left and right, but he didn’t like the movie offers that followed. So instead of striking while the iron is hot, he decided to take a break from movies. He hoped to completely detach himself from his most famous role yet. He went overseas and took a short course about filmmaking, but as his agency announced his comeback, the offers remained the same. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It has been a year. Why do people still want to see me die?” Hokuto complained during the meeting with his manager and agent. His agency has received a dozen scripts from different production companies since they hinted at his return. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You’re a very good <em> dier </em> – if that’s a word,” quipped Kochi, his long-time agent since he joined the agency, <em> Type AB</em>.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I don’t mind doing any genre as long as I live,” he added, while he checked another script titled, “Signal”.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I scanned that one. It’s a police drama with elements of time-altering,” said Jesse, his manager. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He opened the script with interest. “I’ve always wanted to be in a <em> deka </em> drama.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It’s open-ending, but it's pretty much given you died,” added Jesse and the script immediately went to the reject pile.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I want it clear that I'm alive. How about this one…'The One That Got Away’?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“That’s a fantasy,” said Kochi disapprovingly. “I’m not really a fan.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Really? I thought it was a romcom from the title, but do I get to live though?” He asked as he riffled the pages. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You will,” said Jesse with a grin, “But you will die three times first, but because it’s a fantasy, you still get to live.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His face fell another script landing on the reject pile. “Sounds complicated.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You want romcom? How about this one? You’ll be playing a widowed father and you live next to a woman who doesn’t do housework,” Kochi suggested. “Do you want to try it?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He took the script from Kochi and read the logline. “I’ll give it a read, I like the change.” His phone’s alarm rang, and he panicked seeing he had entered the wrong time. He had a date at 6: 30 in the evening, but he set the alarm exactly at 6: 30.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Shit! I need to go. I’m late.” He grabbed a bunch of scripts by his right side before he rushed to his waiting car. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He is late, and his girlfriend, Alice, will be livid. This wasn’t the first time he got late on their date because of work, and even during his short hiatus from work, he was still late most of the time. It was never his character to be late, he always valued his and others’ time. But he didn’t know why when it came to dating, time was never on his side. Something would always come up at the last minute. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You don’t have to wait for me, but will you drop these to my place on your way home?” He asked his driver, giving him the scripts he took earlier. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The French restaurant where Alice and he agreed to meet was full when he arrived, and he could only sigh in relief at seeing Alice was still there. It also seemed that she started eating ahead of him, a soup entrée was already on the table, and she was busy stirring her spoon until she saw him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I’m so-”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Drop it,” said Alice. She lost interest in the soup as she took a gulp of red wine. “It’s not like this is the first time. It got to the point I never expected you to arrive on time anyway.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He pursed his lips and sat across from her. “I was reading some scripts-” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Script, huh? I bet you’re looking for one where you remain alive?” Alice cuts in.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He was embarrassed to admit it. “Uhm, yeah.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You said you had this aversion to accepting roles where you would end up dying because you’ve dreamt numerous times that you died and it scares you.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto nodded. He never really liked “dying characters” and he only accepted “Moving” because he wasn’t getting any offers for a lead role. He seemed to be stuck in the cycle of the second male lead, the nice guy who never gets the girl, and a bunch of supporting characters. “Moving” was a game changer. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“But I’m sure you don’t regret taking that risk, right?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He nodded again. Dying in the movie launched him to stardom. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I guess you’d rather take the risk with work than me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The smile on his face froze. He guessed what they said about women was true; they were scarier when they were no longer angry. And what Alice said next cemented that.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Let’s free ourselves, Hokuto.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked quietly. He knew full well what it meant. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Let’s break up. Let’s end this.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He felt like his surroundings were paused, saved for his beating heart.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“This isn’t just about you being always late,” said Alice as though he read his mind, “But if you couldn’t even commit even a minute for me, I doubt you could commit a lifetime with me.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Alice dabbed a napkin on her lips and left him without so much of a glance. He watched his reflection on Alice’s wine glass and felt awful. He didn’t deserve Alice, because he felt relieved it was over than sad. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<em> “But if you couldn’t even commit at least one minute for me, I doubt you could commit a lifetime with me.” </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Time was never his problem, it was commitment. He might sound like he’s buttering his shortcomings, but he seems repulsed over two things. First is dying, and second is committing to a relationship. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He had no idea where everything stemmed from. Except for that event during high school, his life had been pretty laid back. He had no major heartbreaks. No near-death experiences. His mom passed away at childbirth, but his dad is alive and well. No drama with his friends. And his career has always been thriving. So where did his fear even begin?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He was so lost in thought; he didn’t realize he had arrived home. The pile of scripts was waiting by his kitchen counter along with a few mail, junk adverts, and a purple padded envelope. Frowning, he opened the envelope and found a purple iPhone. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Huh? Whose phone is this?” He checked the envelope for any address, but there was none. He tried to turn on the phone, but it remained dead, so he went to his charging ports until the green drip was on the screen. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He pressed the power on button, but he didn’t wait for it to fully turn on before he went to take a bath. He picked a script to read for bed until he fell asleep, and the purple iPhone was completely forgotten.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>If he remembered and checked the phone, he might have seen the lock screen change from an old photo of his to a generic wallpaper with the time set at 00:00 Jan 01, 2024. </p><p align="left"><br/>

</p><p>Riku, one of the senior writers of Panache Publishing where Taiga worked as a photographer, asked, "If some people are fated to meet, are there also people who are fated never to meet?" He, along with the other heads plus one team member of each division, were having their twice-monthly story conference. Everyone is expected to come up with themes and ideas for either “Jouhin” or “Virginia”, their monthly fashion magazine and quarterly literary magazine, respectively.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga couldn't understand why he had to drop ideas as well, especially when they consistently rejected all of his ideas for photoshoots due to "lack of vision," whatever that meant. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Interesting,” said Miranda, their overall editor-in-chief, whose name wasn’t really Miranda, but she wanted to pretend that her workplace was “The Devil Wears Prada” set. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What do you think of that, Taiga?” asked Miranda, and Taiga didn’t miss how Juri, their graphic artist, smirked at his predicament. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Is that an idea for a photoshoot theme?” He asked, just to refresh everyone’s memory that he is a photographer. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“No,” said Miranda with a cluck of her tongue, “But what do you think about it as a man? Fate is usually a drivel believed by most women, so I want a differing opinion.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga glanced at Riku, she looked uncomfortable, and Taiga had a hard time gauging whether Miranda was just setting up the table to shoot Riku’s idea down, or would his opinion be used for consideration.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He sighed and flicked his pen, choosing his words carefully. “I agree with Riku. I also think that some people are fated to meet, and some people are not. But I don’t like the romantic or even divine aspect they associate it with. After all, there is such a thing as ill fate. Strangers who were also fated to meet, but only to be each other's ruin. Or worse, demise. Wouldn’t it be nice if they never met at all?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>His answer was met with silence, everyone looked at him with awe as though it was the first time he ever talked sense in his 6 years of working for Panache. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Interesting,” said Miranda with one of her gloaty smiles, “I’m sure you could come up with a meaningful essay on that for our ‘<em>After Dinner Conversations</em>’ column in Virginia.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga was stumped. He didn’t really like writing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Miranda declared the meeting adjourned before he could protest and left the room with two of her overworked assistants. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“She’s a bitch,” Taiga complained as he and Juri walked to their pantry. “Remember when she made me fly to LA to shoot Ohtani Shohei? Then, I learned that we didn't even have an appointment, and I had to essentially act as a paparazzo. That’s the same level as ordering me to fucking write an essay.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You should have just played dumb,” said Juri as he put a Nespresso pod to the machine, “Instead of being a smart alec.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga groaned. “I thought she might reject Riku’s idea if I disagree or something. I didn’t think it would be my downfall.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The tantalizing smell of freshly pressed coffee wafted toward him and it was such a shame he didn’t drink coffee. Juri then opened the fridge and took out oolong tea. Printed on the bottle is the face of a famous frontman from the band <em>Eclipse</em>. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It’s not like you can’t write,” said Juri as he opened the tea for him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I can, but I won’t,” he argued and commented on the face of his drink. “He looks like he prefers energy drinks over tea.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What’s your point?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Nothing. Just thinking that fate works in mysterious ways.” He took a gulp of the oolong tea.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What’s this? Are you now mentally preparing for your essay?” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He ignored Juri’s teasing and finished his drink. It was good, but he was too irritated to appreciate it. His phone buzzed, and he got more irritated. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Is this a scam?” He asked, showing Juri the message. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Juri reads, “Congratulations! Your script is now being considered being a full-length movie. We would like to invite you for a contract signing at our head office, 6-17-6 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo. For more details, please check your email. A copy of the contract has also been attached. Again, congratulations! We look forward to working with you.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What did you join?” asked Juri.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I didn’t join anything,” said Taiga, but deep inside, he wasn’t that confident with his memory. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“The address looks familiar. Let me search…” Juri took out his phone and after a few taps, he gasped, “...The address belongs to TAHO Studios.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga also gasped. “The TAHO Studios?” TAHO is one of the top film studios in Japan. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You sneaky bastard…they had a scriptwriting contest, and you won?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga was so confused. “I swear, I never joined anything. Do I look like I have scripts lying around?” As soon as he said that, cold sweat trickled down his back. He had a script saved on his laptop at home. He wrote it out of boredom and frustration. It was a story he didn’t want to see the light of day. It was strictly for his eyes only. It was his very own “ill fate”.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Amidst Juri’s scowls, Taiga excused himself to go back to his area and quickly checked his company and personal email. Both were clear. There were no emails from TAHO Studios, or any studios for that matter. He also checked his sent items up to six months back and he didn’t send anything to any studios. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He sighed in relief. The message was probably sent in error, so he composed a reply to clear the air. <em> “Hello. I think this message was sent by mistake. I didn’t join any contest, nor did I send any scripts.” </em> </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The reply came fast, and he quickly read, “Hi, this is TAHO Studios. Is this not Morimoto-san? We received your script titled ‘The One That Got Away’....” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<em> We received your script titled ‘The One That Got Away’... </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He dropped his phone before he could finish reading the message. Fear coursing through veins. “This must not happen,” he murmured. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Where are you going?” asked Juri when Taiga passed by the pantry. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga forced a smile, and Juri’s reaction told him he must have looked scary. “I’m going to kill my housemate.” </p><p> </p>

<span>Waited 3 mos for a seat and this is what I get for an appetizer 🤢🍅 (pic of caprese salad)</span>

</p><p align="center"><br/>

<span>“Let’s try 000000.” Hokuto entered 00000 and got another error. “And now it’s locked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just leave it to the police,” Jesse advised, while they waited for the staff to change the set for his ongoing photoshoot. "If someone intentionally left it in your mailbox, chances are it's from a stalker," Jesse explained. “They might be listening to our conversation right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t think so,” he said dubiously. “It’s not connected to Wi-Fi. There’s no sim, so I don’t know how they could access this remotely.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just leave it to the police,” Jesse repeated. “We’re not techie enough to know. Remember when you turned on Space while you were in the bathroom and your 866,000 followers heard the trumpet from your behind –?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s not bring up the past, okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jesse resumed his attention on his iPad, remaining unconvinced that the purple phone was some kind of stalking device. However, if Jesse was right that a stalker left it, his next guess should be right. He waited for the timer to end and entered his birthdate as a passcode.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“061895.”</span>
</em>
<span> He waited with bated breath and the phone was unlocked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He bit his lower lip to hide his surprise. His manager would only be more convinced that a stalker left the phone, especially once he saw its wallpaper. It was one of Hokuto’s earliest ads for Uniqlo. He wouldn’t forget the date. On his 25th birthday, they unveiled Hokuto's ad at Uniqlo's newest flagship store in Ginza.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“But why would a stalker leave me their phone?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He checked the settings for an Apple ID but it was blank. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Has this phone never been set up?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He checked for contacts and messages, but all were empty. The gallery was displaying 666 photos, but all were corrupted, saved for his Uniqlo ad. He connected the phone to Wi-Fi and opened Safari, but there was no search history. None of the pre-installed apps were linked to any account. No passwords were saved. The phone is looking brand new as far as he is concerned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“And there is nothing weirder than an empty phone,” </span>
</em>
<span>he mused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto, smile!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He flashed one supercilious smile along with his </span>
<em>
<span>gyaru</span>
</em>
<span> peace pose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you too old for that pose? I’ll upload this on your Twitter, I mean X.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He simply shrugged. He and Jesse both have access to his official X account. Jesse likes to upload photos, while the old-fashioned side of him wants to use X as how and why Twitter was created, and that’s posting his ramblings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Matsumura-san, please get ready.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes.” He was about to drop the iPhone into his bag when a notification arrived that startled him. It was a Twitter notification.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Huh? It hasn’t been updated to X yet?” </span>
</em>
<span>He opened the notification that led him to his account. It was the photo Jesse had just taken along with the caption, “Guess where?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sweat beaded his brow, his chest heaving in anticipation as he pressed the old birdhouse icon. The Twitter icon was the default white egg with a purple background. He clicked "Profile" and the app directed him to a private account. </span>

<span>He scrolled the tweets, and they were all QRTs of his past tweets. The most recent and last QRT was his Jan 01, 2024 post, where he greeted everyone with a “Happy New Year” and <em>@Hokutosrunner33</em> quoted with “Answered prayer. Thank you for being alive. Please live long and I’ll always be cheering for you from afar.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something bloomed in his chest, and before he realized what was happening, there were teardrops on the phone screen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto? What are you still doing here? A-are you crying?” asked Jesse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I crying?” He repeated softly, running his fingers over his face and touching his salty tears. “What just happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jesse looked as concerned. “Are you okay?” When Jesse’s eyes travelled to the phone, Hokuto quickly locked it and placed it face down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m okay, must be the eyeshadow,” he said as he lightly dabbed a cotton pad around his eyes. “Let’s go,” he added with a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He glanced at the phone before leaving his dressing room. He still couldn’t shake off the unease. The QRT looked generic enough. If he recalled the public QRTs from that New Year post of his, most of them were celebratory messages for being given another year to live. So why did he feel so sad seeing that particular QRT? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Matsumura-san, can you give me a longing, searching look?” Minato instructed. He is the apprentice photographer working with him for his Houjin photoshoot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto nodded and stared at the fake fireplace on his right with a backdrop of snow-covered pine trees and starry nights. The cabin room set looked warm and cozy for the holiday season.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good. That’s it! That’s it! Now, let’s turn on the lights.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The wreath on top of the fireplace glowed as mini Christmas Lights flickered. And while he looked ruefully at the dancing lights, he realized the room was missing someone to share the warmth with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Amazing, as always. </span>
<em>
<span>Moving </span>
</em>
<span>became a hit because you looked so good with emotions. If there’s beauty in sorrow, you’ll be the face of it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He turned and smiled at Miranda, Panache’s domineering editor-in-chief, who didn’t give a shit even when he was in the middle of the photoshoot. Minato also looked peeved for the disruption, but couldn’t do anything about his boss.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you for agreeing to this shoot, Hokuto-kun. When I heard about your comeback, I just had to have you added to our December issue.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto dipped his head as a greeting to Miranda. “Thank you for having me as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“By the way, have you met our apprentice photographer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto nodded. “Yes, I’ve met Minato-san before when I did the last shoot for your ‘Boy Next Door’ campaign,” he said, exchanging smiles with Minato. All BND models have to be below 28 years old and he graduated at the beginning of 2023. It was also after that time that he took a time off following Moving’s success. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess I have to apologise to your agent,” said Miranda, sighing, “Our head photographer is running late because of an urgent business when Kochi specifically requested that he spearhead this photo shoot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, Miranda, I’m sure Kochi would understand, and Minato here is just as able.” He had no idea why Kochi wanted the magazine’s head photographer, but Hokuto didn’t think Kochi would ask for a reshoot when they were already super busy with meetings left and right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Minato beamed at this praise, and the shoot continued without another disruption. He returned to his dressing room as soon as the photoshoot was over. His mind is still on the mysterious Twitter account and he didn’t notice which way he was walking until he collided with someone. Both of them groaned as they reeled back from the impact. Despite Hokuto’s head vibrating like a tuning fork, a purple iPhone that fell on the floor caught his eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He picked up the phone to see the screen cracked in the upper right corner, but more so, it was </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> iPhone. He turned to the man on the floor and was prepared to berate him for trying to steal his phone. But he couldn’t tell him off when he looked back with tears in his eyes. And Miranda’s words earlier echoed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“If there’s beauty in sorrow, you’ll be the face of it.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto hesitated, feeling like the bad one even though he didn’t do anything wrong.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“W-why are you crying? It’s not like I did anything to you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just like him earlier, the man probably didn’t realize he cried. The man averted his gaze, wiping his tears away, and lowering his black cap on his face. He was dressed in an all-black ensemble, which just highlighted his fair skin. He recoiled a bit when he tried to stand, which made Hokuto sigh and offered his hand. But the man ignored him and stood up on his own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why is my phone with you?” He asked instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The man still avoided his gaze, but his eyes were on the phone. “That’s yours?” He asked, his tone inflecting that he knew Hokuto wasn’t the original owner of the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wouldn’t admit it wasn’t his, and his rebellious side decided to unlock the phone and show the man the wallpaper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have more doubts that it’s mine?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah…I guess I’m mistaken. Excuse me-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto slammed his arm on the wall, preventing the man from passing by him. “Not too fast, mister, did you just try to steal my phone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I just made a mistake,” he replied glumly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? And what were you doing in my dressing room? Did you also think it was your room?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have some business.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What business -?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto!” He turned and saw Jesse running toward him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto scoffed and grabbed the man’s wrist. “This guy tried to steal my phone.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s ridiculous!” The man argued, while he tried fiercely to free himself from his hold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry about that, Kyomoto-san,” said Jesse and forcibly break Hokuto’s hold on this Kyomoto-san. The name rang a bell, but he couldn’t place where. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure it was an honest mistake - and besides,” Jesse leaned closer and added through gritted teeth, “That’s not really yours”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you apologizing to him?” asked Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jesse sighed. “This is Kyomoto Taiga, Panache’s head photographer, and he dropped by your dressing room to give a box of sweets for Kochi as an apology, because he didn’t get to do your photoshoot. And you just accused him of stealing that phone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now he knows where he heard Kyomoto Taiga’s name. People who thought they knew each other professionally always mentioned Kyomoto Taiga's name to him in passing. However, Hokuto never met him until today.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“W-well, being the head doesn’t make him innocent-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s just go to the police then,” Taiga cuts in. He was no longer meek and looked utterly pissed. And when Hokuto chose to challenge Taiga’s glare, he thought those eyes were familiar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s not go that far,” Jesse mediated and whispered to him, “Drop it, Hokuto. I don’t know why you’re obsessed over that phone, but I’m quite sure the police might want to take it because it's not yours.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto cleared his throat and gave up. “Okay. I think this was all just—a mistake.” He gaped at Jesse, who was equally floored at Taiga’s audacity to just leave while he was still talking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know what? Except for Minato-kun, I think every other staff member here is Miranda’s spawn,” muttered Hokuto and left a still dumbfounded Jesse.</span>

<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga rarely takes the bus, but at the moment when he felt like his entire day had gone wrong, the long ride on the bus gave him a much-needed reprieve. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He tried calling Shintaro again. His phone had been turned off since yesterday. Shintaro left following their argument, and Shintaro hadn’t answered any of his calls. He and Shintaro had been long-time childhood friends, and he loved Shintaro like his own brother. It also hurt Taiga that something like this had to happen between them. He also knew Shintaro needed the money, but he couldn't permit the script to be turned into a movie, or all his hard work would be in vain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bus reached its last stop. He got down to transfer to another bus when it started drizzling. He just crossed the road when the drizzle turned to a rain of cats and dogs. The tiny shed soon became full of people like him who forgot their umbrellas, and even those with umbrellas didn’t want to get soaked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He sighed and continued ruminating about his day when a nanny van stopped at him. The windows rolled down, and Kochi’s sunshine smile greeted him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get in, Taiga!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn’t think twice and took the front seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I didn't think I would see you..." he said hesitantly upon seeing who sat behind him through the rearview mirror. How could he have forgotten? “...here,” he finished with distaste in his mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me, too!” Said Kochi, oblivious to the rising tension inside the van. “Why are you in this area? Didn’t you live somewhere near the Arakawa River?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, but I was…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me you still fall asleep on the bus?” asked Kochi, chuckling. “Seriously, Taiga, even until now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Errr, you can put it that way,” he replied, scratching his head when the unrelated party spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You should be careful, falling asleep on the bus can be dangerous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ahhh,” Taiga mumbled. He couldn’t care less about the unsolicited advice from the man who accused him of stealing a phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tch, how is that dangerous? Normal people do that all the time,” said Kochi when his eyes grew wide with realization. “Oh, yeah…Jess told me about what happened between you two earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s no big deal,” they said in unison, earning them an amused smile from Kochi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Taiga and I are friends way back in college,” said Kochi, “and now we’re both in the media.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga smiled. “Yup.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto has been under our agency since he won Mr. Muse at 21, and he has been under me since I started working at the agency,” he continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice,” he said simply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I’ve known both of you for a long time, and when you say ‘it’s no big deal’, I’m sure it's a big deal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kochi!” they said at the same time. Taiga clucked his tongue and Kochi just chuckled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why don’t we have dinner together? Any suggestions?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just sighed. The rain continued to lash hard, and his day was really far from over.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>***</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto might have a praise kink, but didn’t think fame had gone over his head. He doesn’t care if some people don’t know him. He doesn’t care if he’s treated like a nobody, but for some reason, it’s quite unnerving being treated like he’s invincible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, I’ve heard about that place! I heard they served those rare blue lobsters,” Hokuto remarked when Taiga mentioned a famous seafood restaurant. Taiga ignored him and ate his yakitori as though Hokuto was speaking to someone else from another table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kochi said excitedly, "We should celebrate there once you sign a deal for your next movie." He didn’t seem to notice Taiga’s colder than Antarctica's treatment of him. Hokuto knew it was wrong of him to accuse Taiga of trying to steal a phone that wasn’t his, but was it really that bad to the point of him being irredeemable? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If we find the right script, that is,” he said, gulping his beer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Taiga, here,” said Kochi, wrapping an arm around his friend and sounding drunker by the second, “is a terrific writer!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not,” said Taiga, removing Kochi’s arm around him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Even our professor thought he had won the Naoki Prize by now, but he chose to dabble in photography instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga sighed. “It’s not dabbling. I’m a professional and it’s my bread and butter,” he remarked and Hokuto could tell that it wasn’t the first time Taiga had to explain for choosing photography over writing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Kochi wasn’t having any of it. “Sky’s the limit. Why don’t you write something for Hokuto? I’ll accept anything...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto cocked an eyebrow. He didn’t think they had unlimited funds, and he got curious about how good of a writer Taiga was if Kochi was willing to spend that much. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“...but make sure Hokuto lives, though. You can even write </span>
<em>
<span>yaoi</span>
</em>
<span>, but make sure he lives. He’s allergic to dying and - who’s calling me?” His face shifted from annoyed to apprehensive seeing the caller. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s HH,” he said in a whisper, referring to the agency’s ‘head honcho’. “I’ll take this outside. Behave yourselves, okay?” warned Kochi before he walked unsteadily outside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will he be okay?” asked Hokuto, while he watched his agent almost stumble to someone else’s table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was that about? About you being afraid of dying?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto turned, perplexed that Taiga acknowledged his existence. He looked sideways, before asking, “Are you talking to me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn’t miss the sarcasm and rolled his eyes. “No, I’m talking to myself.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn’t think he would find Taiga’s embarrassment so amusing. “I think everyone is afraid of dying,” he said after a while. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Even if it’s fictional?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded. “Why not? Dying in a movie can be a harrowing experience. Lead actors never just drop dead. There has to be drama and lengthy dialogues. It’s a very demanding task.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see,” said Taiga, eating another yakitori, Hokuto noticed how many sticks were on Taiga’s side compared to his and Kochi. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you not afraid of dying?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn’t think twice. “No.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Even at this age?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s…very brave of you then,” he said, impressed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga finished his beer and sighed. “There’s no need to be worried,” said Taiga as he looked straight into his eyes. “I’m sure you're going to live long.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto gripped his glass so tight, he thought it might snap the handle as the Twitter QRT replayed in his mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why does that sound so sad?” He asked before he could stop himself. He now understood why the QRT baffled him so. It wasn’t a greeting or an affirmation, it was a goodbye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span><em>@Hokutosrunner33</em> decided to start the year by bidding him goodbye. And he didn’t know why a stranger’s tweet affected him so. Fans always come and go. <em>@Hokutosrunner33</em>’s tweet was even made in private, it was never meant for him to see. So why did he feel sad knowing a fan of his had left him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you guys behave yourselves while I was gone?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have to leave,” said Taiga. “I just remembered that I have to be looking for my housemate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But-” Kochi objected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Call a driver, okay? Both of you shouldn’t drive. And this meal is on me.” Taiga left with their tab, and Kochi ran after him, protesting that he would be paying. Hokuto just sat there, looking at Kochi and Taiga while they argued at the counter. He assumed Taiga managed to beat Kochi from paying, because Kochi followed him out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto opened his X and posted, “Hope you’re all doing well. Thank you for existing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A notification arrived on the purple iPhone in an instant, and even though @Hokutosrunner33 may never know it was intended for her or him, Hokuto could only hope that they had also seen his post.</span>

You don’t really drink, is it - is it because of me?” Guilt flashed across Shintaro’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“No, of course not. Work has been just too stressful.” It was the truth.

I almost lost our friendship over TAHO.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ahhh…but I remember you asking me for a million yen for a tent like 6 mos ago?”</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro frowned, looking so confused Taiga almost doubted his memory.

He blamed being lightweight that he got a hangover over 2 glasses of beer. Those beers should have been alcohol-free, so he didn’t get the headache right off the bat. He emptied a bottle of water and turned on his humidifier, before slumping back on his couch. He had an appointment after lunch and hoped the worst had passed.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rrriinnggg… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Groaning, he blindly reached for his phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” he mumbled, keeping his eyes closed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto,” said Jesse, “I think you brought home one script with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“What script?”</p><p> </p><p>“The One That Got Away.”</p><p> </p><p>He frowned. “I don’t think so. Is that the one where the main character died three times? I already rejected that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that one. It's not here and TAHO is recalling it. Can you check again and bring it with you later?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Okay. I’ll check and bring it later if I have it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks. See you later.”</p><p> </p><p>He tried to return to dreamland, but sleep remained elusive. He checked the time. It was 8 in the morning. He got up and prepared a quick breakfast of savory oats cooked in chicken broth. And while he waited for it to boil, he checked the pile of scripts that were still on his kitchen island and groaned seeing he brought home the reject pile instead. Except for the script on top, he rejected the rest, including "The One That Got Away". </p><p> </p><p>“Why is TAHO recalling this? Did they realize it was bad, or did someone else want it?” </p><p> </p><p>He called them scripts, but they only really received the screenplay synopsis. The screenplay synopsis mostly consists of a logline and 3 Acts. It would be roughly 10 pages or less, and if it was interesting enough, that would only be the time they would request for the full script. </p><p> </p><p>His oats started boiling and, because he hated washing dishes, he would be eating straight from the pot. He drizzled his oats with honey and blueberries before settling down and started reading the synopsis. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<u> The One That Got Away </u>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<u> Logline </u>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A fanboy is magically transported back to his high school days. Back in the past, he sees it as an opportunity to save his favorite rock singer from meeting his tragic end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<u> Act 1 </u>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story opens with HYOUGA in a hospital. He’s an incoming senior year high school student and he could no longer move his legs because of an accident. And just like his legs, he felt like his life had stopped moving too. Elsewhere in Tokyo, a newly debuted group called “Stones of Rock” are having their first radio guesting. The members have to call a random number to surprise them. Their lead singer, KOUSEI ends up calling Hyouga’s number. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hyouga has no idea who Kousei is. And losing his legs makes him so irritable he hurls hurtful words toward a stranger. But Kousei remains patient and ends the call by telling Hyouga, “Thank you for staying alive. Despite everything, thank you for staying alive. I’m sure someone out there is happy and grateful to see you alive.” Hyouga cried after hearing that and that call was the start of Hyouga’s new journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fast forward to the present year 2023, Hyouga now works as a ghostwriter and is a huge “Stoners”, the fan name for “Stones of Rock”. Meanwhile, Kousei might be a successful frontman, but he just announced to his bandmates and agency that it’ll be his last concert. He is quitting. Unbeknown to the drama behind-the-scenes, Hyouga attended “Stones of Rock” New Year’s Eve concert and on his way home, he had an unexpected encounter with Kousei after his electric wheelchair ran out of batteries. Kousei stayed with Hyouga by the roadside, offering him his umbrella, until Hyouga’s friend arrived. As a token of Hyouga’s appreciation, he gave Kousei a jar of candies, which he knew he loved. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As fireworks lit up the night sky to welcome 2024, Hyouga got alerted by his fandom mutuals of distressing news. According to rumors, Kousei jumped from the balcony of his hotel room into the pool and was found dead. Troubled by the news, Hyouga wheels himself to the hospital. A swarm of reporters are outside, and Hyouga uses his disability and pretends to need medical attention. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once inside, Hyouga tries to look for Kousei as breaking news about his death was on all the TVs. Hyouga mistakenly enters a fire exit and finds himself trapped, because the door cannot be from his side. As Hyouga frantically knocks and calls for help, the watch on his wrist glows. It was an old G-shock watch he brought from a fan auction rumored to be owned by Kousei. Not only did that watch glow, the seconds' time started moving backwards. Thinking there was a malfunction, he pressed buttons D &amp; C together to reset, and the time stopped. But it wasn’t just the watch face time. His surroundings went to a standstill, an eerie silence descended, and even the air seemed to cease. He gasped for air and in the blink of an eye, Hyouga found himself back in his high school classroom with his math teacher glaring at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surprised, he stood up and saw that he was in his freshman class. More surprising that he managed to stand, which meant that his legs were still working fine. Thinking that everything was just a dream and that he could consciously move the way he wanted his dream to be, he ignored his teacher’s shouts and bolted out of his class to their neighboring school. Based on his fan knowledge, Kousei played football during his freshman year, and Hyouga’s heart soared to dizzying heights when he saw Kousei leaving the field with his teammates. Hyouga ran after Kousei and ended in a locker room full of sweaty and naked bodies. Hyouga paid no attention to their yelps. His gaze fixed only on one guy, and Kousei could only stare in shock as Hyouga embraced him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I didn’t know you were in so much pain. I’m sorry. I’ll make it better.”</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s oats had turned gooey. He probably only managed two spoonfuls before he became engrossed in reading the Acts. Despite being only a synopsis, it piqued his interest. And even at this early, he wanted to read the full script. </p><p> </p><p>He opened his phone and sent a LINE message to Jesse, “Sorry, still not feeling well. Can we move the meeting today to tomorrow?” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse replied quickly, “Are you okay? Kochi said you drank last night. Do you need anything?” </p><p> </p><p>“Just need a bit more rest,” he replied back. </p><p> </p><p>“No problem. I'll set the canceled meeting at an earlier time. Is 9 am okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Suits me fine. See you tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>“Get well soon.”</p><p> </p><p>His stomach grumbled, but he didn’t want any of his gooey oatmeal. He returned to his couch and continued to read Act 1. He is dead-set on finishing everything today. His breakfast could wait, as he had a different kind of hunger to satisfy. </p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>“Shintaro did that?!” exclaimed Juri after Taiga relayed what happened between him and his housemate. Juri is also familiar with Shintaro as they all went to the same middle and high school, even though they were two years ahead of Shintaro. </p><p> </p><p>“I know he has some expensive hobbies; biking, diving, and now, camping?” Juri added, chuckling. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head. “It shouldn’t really matter only if he had a lucrative job to match his hobbies instead of taking out loans and maxing-out his credit card just to sustain his hobbies,” he complained. Shintaro has been working as a pre-school teacher and the pay he received was only a fraction of his expenses. </p><p> </p><p>“You spoiled him.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga gaped. “Don’t you dare blame this on me.” In his defense, he didn’t spoil Shintaro, he was just supportive. </p><p> </p><p>Juri just smirked. “Putting that aside, TAHO wants your script, yet you declined? You didn’t have to give Shintaro the money. You can just keep all of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sighed. His previous argument with Shintaro replayed in his head. “It’s not about the money. I don’t want that story out.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why did you write it then?” </p><p> </p><p>“Can’t I write for myself?” He snapped back. “Are all stories meant to be read by someone else?”</p><p> </p><p>“Woah! Why are you angry at me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not angry,” said Taiga, huffing, “I’m just making my point.” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Mr. I-write-for-myself. But what’s the worst that can happen if you put out that story?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at his bento with a forlorn face. “Honestly, I’m also not sure. Maybe nothing will happen, but I’d rather not tempt fate…” <em> Again</em>.</p><p> </p>
