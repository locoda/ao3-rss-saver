      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>There were exactly twenty-seven rules for maintaining a proper professional relationship between a CEO and his personal assistant, and Shintaro has broken every single one of them - especially Rule #27: Never sleep with your PA.</p><p>But bringing Hokuto home for Christmas under the guise of 'urgent work' might just be the rule violation that finally exposes everything to his all-too-perceptive mother.</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is my contribution to Christmas. This is multi-chaptered, but hopefully this shouldn't take too long to finish.

    <h2 class="toc-heading">Strictly Business (Until Christmas)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>The scent of freshly brewed coffee greeted Shintaro before he even opened his office door. Nine o’clock sharp. He couldn't help but smile, knowing Hokuto would already be there, precise as always. The familiar routine they’d developed over the past year settled his nerves after the hectic morning commute.</p><p>“Good morning, Morimoto-shachou.” Hokuto’s formal greeting carried through the doorway as Shintaro entered, shrugging off his coat.</p><p>The morning sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting Hokuto in a warm glow as he stood by the coffee machine. His crisp white shirt and perfectly knotted tie embodied the professional image they maintained. But Shintaro caught the slight softening around Hokuto’s eyes that was reserved just for him.</p><p>Shintaro glanced down the empty hallway. The executive floor remained quiet this early, their footsteps muffled by the plush carpeting. The privacy of his corner office, separated from the rest of the floor, offered a brief moment of sanctuary before the day began.</p><p>He crossed the room in quick strides, coming up behind Hokuto just as he finished preparing their morning coffee. The familiar scent of his cologne mixed with the rich aroma of fresh coffee. Shintaro leaned in, pressing a quick kiss to Hokuto’s cheek.</p><p><em>“Shachou.”</em> Hokuto’s tone carried a warning, though his lips twitched upward. “Professional distance.”</p><p>“It’s only us here,” Shintaro murmured, accepting the cup Hokuto handed him. The warm seeped through the ceramic, matching the warmth in his chest as their fingers brushed.</p><p>He took a sip and closed his eyes in appreciation. Perfect, as always — the exact ratio of coffee to cream that he preferred. After three years together (and a year together <em>together</em>), Hokuto knew his tastes better than he did himself.</p><p>“That’s not the point.” Hokuto straightened Shintaro’s already-straight tie, his touch lingering a fraction longer than strictly necessary. “We have rules.”</p><p>“Twenty-seven of them, if I recall correctly.” Shintaro couldn’t resist teasing. “I’ve memorized every single one.”</p><p>“Only so you can break them more efficiently.” Hokuto picked up his tablet, already shifting into full PA mode. “Your nine-thirty meeting with the development team has been moved to ten. Jesse says he has an urgent proposal to discuss first.”</p><p>The transition from private to professional happened as smoothly as it always did, though Shintaro noticed Hokuto’s ears had turned slightly pink. He took another sip of his perfectly prepared coffee, savoring both the taste and the quiet moment before their carefully maintained façade had to snap fully into place.</p><p>Shintaro settled into his leather chair, the familiar creak grounding him as he transitioned into CEO mode. Hokuto handed him a single sheet of paper, their fingers brushing again in a way that sent a subtle spark through his chest.</p><p>“Your agenda for the executive lunch meeting.” Hokuto’s professional tone didn’t quite match the fondness in his eyes. “I’ve highlighted the key points in order of priority.”</p><p>Shintaro scanned the document, a smile tugging at his lips as he saw the familiar names. Who would have thought his old college crew would end up here? Yugo, now heading HR with his endless policies and procedures. Taiga in finance, turning his sharp wit to quarterly reports instead of exam answers. Juri bringing his creative chaos to marketing. And Jesse, whose wild business proposals had evolved from dorm room schemes to actual corporate strategy.</p><p>
  <em>Look how far we’ve come from cramming for finals together.</em>
</p><p>“I know that look.” Hokuto’s voice cut through his nostalgia. “Remember, you need to be firm with their proposals. Especially Jesse’s.”</p><p>“I’m always firm,” Shintaro protested, though he knew better. The slight arch of Hokuto’s eyebrow said it all.</p><p>“Last week you approved Jesse’s plan for virtual reality property tours before he even finished his presentation.”</p><p>“It was a good idea!”</p><p>“It was, but you didn’t negotiate any of the budget constraints.” Hokuto’s fingers drummed lightly on his tablet. “You can’t keep saying yes to everything just because they’re your friends.”</p><p><em>He’s right.</em> Shintaro had always struggled with maintaining professional distance from his college group. The same people he’d shared instant ramen with at 3 AM now sat across from him in the boardroom. It made being strict... complicated.</p><p>“I’ll be more careful,” he promised, earning another skeptical look from Hokuto.</p><p>“About the Christmas party tonight...” Hokuto glanced at his tablet, though Shintaro suspected he wasn’t actually reading anything. “I’ll need to leave early to handle some preparations.”</p><p>The slight pink tinge returning to Hokuto’s ears told Shintaro exactly what kind of “preparations” he meant. Their private celebration in his apartment.</p><p>“Of course. Very important preparations.” Shintaro tried to keep his voice neutral, professional, but he couldn’t quite hide his smile. The thought of Hokuto decorating his apartment, making it special just for them, sent a warm flutter through his chest.</p><p>The shrill ring of the office phone cut through their comfortable silence. Hokuto moved with practiced efficiency to answer it, his voice shifting into the polished tones he used for business calls.</p><p>Shintaro watched him, mind drifting back to the PA interviews three years ago. He’d dreaded the whole process — sitting through endless candidates who looked perfect on paper but lacked that essential <em>something</em> he needed in an assistant. By the time Hokuto walked in, Shintaro had been ready to give up and let HR handle it.</p><p>Then Hokuto had smiled, bowed perfectly, and handed over a resume that made Shintaro’s heart skip for two very different reasons.</p><p>First, because it was exactly what they needed‚ experience, qualifications, recommendations, all impeccable.</p><p>And second, because Hokuto was absolutely stunning, with those dark eyes and that tiny beauty mark above his lip that Shintaro definitely shouldn’t have noticed during a professional interview.</p><p>He’d almost passed on hiring Hokuto despite his perfect qualifications, worried his attraction would make things awkward. But Hokuto’s quiet competence had won out over Shintaro’s concerns. He’d proven himself invaluable within weeks, anticipating needs before Shintaro voiced them, handling the chaos of the executive floor with unflappable grace.</p><p>Shintaro’s gaze traced the familiar line of Hokuto’s jaw as he spoke into the phone, remembering the first time he’d kissed it — a year ago, during yet another late-night strategy session. The tension that had been building between them finally snapped when Hokuto leaned over his shoulder to point out something in a report, his cologne making Shintaro dizzy with want.</p><p>They’d tried so hard to be professional after that first kiss. Set up rules, drawn boundaries. But one kiss led to another, and another, until they’d given up pretending they could go back to being just CEO and PA.</p><p>Now only a select few knew — Ryutaro had figured it quickly because, <em>of course</em>, his older brother always does. Jesse had burst into Shintaro’s office at exactly the wrong moment, though he’d just grinned and declared it “totally awesome, boss!” And Juri... well, Juri was terrible at lying but surprisingly good at keeping secrets.</p><p>“The contractor for the Shibuya project is on line two.”</p><p>Hokuto’s voice pulled him from his memories. Their eyes met, and Hokuto’s cheeks flushed as he caught Shintaro staring. He quickly looked down at his tablet, tapping the screen with slightly more force than necessary.</p><p>“Right. Okay.” Shintaro reached for the phone, and Hokuto turned back to his work, the pink still lingering on his ears.</p><p>Shintaro shifted into CEO mode, his voice taking on the polished authority he’d cultivated over years of corporate leadership. The contractor’s concerns about the Shibuya project timeline were valid but manageable. He addressed each point methodically, making mental notes of items that would need follow-up.</p><p>He watched Hokuto move around his office with practiced grace. The morning sun caught in his dark hair as he organized documents, creating neat stacks on the side table. Even such a simple task commanded his full attention — that laser focus that had first caught Shintaro’s eye during the interview.</p><p>“Yes, we can accommodate those changes,” Shintaro assured the contractor, forcing his attention back to the call. “Have your team send over the revised specifications by end of day.”</p><p>He ended the call, his mind already drifting to the conversation he’d been planning all morning. The family Christmas invitation had seemed so simple when his mother first suggested it — <em>bring your PA, dear, you’ll probably need to work</em> — but now his heart raced at the thought of actually asking.</p><p>“Hokuto.” His voice came out slightly rougher than intended. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Do you have a moment?”</p><p>Hokuto looked up from his tablet, eyebrow raised in that subtle way that always made Shintaro’s chest tighten. “Of course, shachou.”</p><p>
  <em>Stop being nervous. It’s just a business request. Technically.</em>
</p><p>“Do you have plans for Christmas?” The words tumbled out before he could overthink them further.</p><p>“Plans?” Hokuto’s fingers stilled on his tablet. “Not particularly. My parents are touring Europe this year — Mom’s always wanted to see Paris at Christmas. And my brother’s taking his family to Osaka.”</p><p>“So you’ll be in Tokyo?”</p><p>“Yes.” Hokuto’s lips curved slightly. “I thought it best to stay close in case work required attention.”</p><p><em>Always so dedicated.</em> The warmth in Shintaro’s chest spread. But there was also an ache at the thought of Hokuto spending the holiday alone, probably catching up on reports that could absolutely wait until January.</p><p>“Actually...” Shintaro tugged at his tie, suddenly feeling too warm despite the office’s perfect temperature control. “My family has a villa in Kanazawa. We spend Christmas there every year.”</p><p>“I remember approving the maintenance contracts.” Hokuto’s professional mask slipped just slightly, a hint of amusement showing through. “And arranging the catering schedule.”</p><p>“Right.” Shintaro ran a hand through his hair, probably ruining its careful styling. “Well, mother suggested — that is, given the end-of-year reports and the new development proposals...” He took a breath. “Would you consider joining us? For work purposes, officially.”</p><p>The tablet lowered slowly as Hokuto processed this. His expression remained carefully neutral, but Shintaro caught the slight widening of his eyes.</p><p>“Your family’s villa?” Hokuto’s voice held a note of caution. “For Christmas?”</p><p>“Mom specifically asked me to invite you.” <em>Though she doesn’t know exactly why I want you there.</em> “She said I’d probably need my PA with all the year-end business matters.”</p><p>“Your mother.” Hokuto’s ears had turned that telling shade of pink again. “Asked for me specifically.”</p><p>“Yes.” Shintaro resisted the urge to loosen his tie further. “Though obviously if you’d rather stay in Tokyo...”</p><p>“No, I...” Hokuto set the tablet down entirely, a rare break in his professional routine. “Are you sure this is wise? Your whole family will be there.”</p><p>The unspoken concern hung between them. A week at the family villa meant navigating countless potential complications. Maintaining their professional façade under his mother’s shrewd gaze. Sharing space with the entire Morimoto clan. Trying to keep their relationship hidden while living under the same roof.</p><p>“I want you there,” Shintaro said softly. “Even if we have to be careful. Even if it’s complicated.” He glanced at the door before adding, “I don’t want to spend Christmas pretending you don’t exist outside this office.”</p><p>A shadow crossed Hokuto’s face. “Will Haru-san be…” He hesitated. “Arranging any special meetings during the holidays?”</p><p><em>Damn.</em> Shintaro’s stomach clenched. The memory of last New Year’s surfaced — his mother’s carefully orchestrated “accidental” encounters with eligible daughters of business partners. And there was Hokuto, trapped in his role as the perfect PA, helping arrange these meetings while maintaining his professional mask.</p><p>“I’m not sure.” Shintaro’s throat felt tight. “She hasn’t mentioned anything specific.”</p><p>“Last time she had me coordinate three separate tea ceremonies.” Hokuto’s voice remained carefully neutral, but Shintaro caught the slight tension in his shoulders. “The daughter of the Iino Group’s CEO was particularly interested in real estate development.”</p><p><em>And you had to sit there taking notes while she flirted with me across the table.</em> Shintaro remembered how Hokuto’s handwriting had grown progressively sharper on the page, though his face never betrayed a thing.</p><p>“She was interested in the property valuations,” Shintaro muttered. “Nothing else.”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyebrow rose slightly. “She asked about your favorite restaurant six times.”</p><p>“You counted?”</p><p>“It’s my job to track important details.” A hint of dry humor crept into Hokuto’s tone. “Just like it’s my job to help Haru-san arrange these... networking opportunities.”</p><p>The word choice made Shintaro wince. His mother had been intensifying her matchmaking efforts lately, dropping hints about grandchildren and family legacy. Just last month, she’d called Hokuto directly to discuss potential meeting arrangements, praising his organizational skills while completely unaware of how each carefully planned omiai felt like a twist of the knife to them both.</p><p>“I’ll try to head her off,” Shintaro promised. “Make excuses about end-of-year reports being a priority.”</p><p>“That won’t stop her.” Hokuto’s fingers drummed lightly on his tablet. “Remember when she scheduled that lunch with the pharmaceutical heiress during last quarter’s board meeting? She said, and I quote, ‘Hokuto-kun, surely you can move some things around. A man shouldn’t work through every meal.’”</p><p><em>The irony of having you arrange dates with women while we’re secretly together.</em> Shintaro rubbed his temples, feeling a headache building. His mother meant well, he knew that. She just wanted him settled, happy, continuing the family line.</p><p>If only she knew he was already settled and happy — just not in the way she imagined.</p><p>“I’ll handle it,” Shintaro insisted, though they both knew how skilled his mother was at orchestrating these things. She had a way of making them happen regardless of his protests, and Hokuto’s position meant he’d be caught in the middle again, maintaining his professional façade while watching Shintaro dodge marriage prospects.</p><p>“Of course, <em>shachou</em>.” Hokuto’s formal tone carried a hint of resignation. “Should I prepare the usual meeting templates? Just in case?”</p><p>The quiet acceptance in Hokuto's voice made something in Shintaro’s chest ache. How many more omiai would they have to endure? How many more times would Hokuto have to help plan meetings with potential wives, all while hiding his own feelings behind that perfect professional mask?</p><p>“No templates,” Shintaro said firmly. “I’ll find a way to avoid it this time.”</p><p>The phone’s shrill ring broke through the tension. Hokuto answered with his usual efficiency, but Shintaro caught the slight strain around his eyes.</p><p>“Yes, of course. I’ll be right down.” Hokuto ended the call, his fingers lingering on the phone. “They need help with the Christmas party setup. I should be back before the executive lunch meeting.”</p><p><em>Don’t go.</em> The words caught in Shintaro’s throat.</p><p>Instead, he rose from his chair, catching Hokuto’s wrist before he could step away. The familiar warmth of his skin made Shintaro’s chest tighten.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” His voice came out rough. “About the omiai, about the hiding, about all of it.”</p><p>Hokuto’s expression softened, that rare unguarded look that made Shintaro fall for him all over again. “Don’t apologize. Coming out should be your choice, not something forced by circumstances.”</p><p>“But watching you arrange those meetings...” Shintaro’s grip tightened slightly. “It kills me every time.”</p><p>“I knew what I was getting into.” Hokuto stepped closer, his free hand coming up to straighten Shintaro’s tie again. “The rules, the secrecy, all of it. I chose this. I chose <em>you</em>.”</p><p>The simple honesty in those words made Shintaro’s heart clench. He pulled Hokuto closer, grateful for his office’s privacy screens as he pressed their lips together. The kiss tasted of coffee and longing and things they couldn’t say in the light of day.</p><p>Hokuto returned the kiss for a moment before pulling back, his ears pink. “I need to go help with the party.” But he leaned in for one more quick kiss, a silent reassurance.</p><p>Shintaro watched him leave, the empty doorway echoing with unspoken words. His hand pressed against his chest, trying to ease the ache building there. <em>I don’t want to hide anymore. Not you, not us, not who I am.</em></p><p>The Christmas tree in the corner of his office caught his eye — a small thing Hokuto had set up last week, decorated in the company’s colors. Professional, appropriate, perfect. Just like their carefully maintained façade.</p><p><em>Maybe this Christmas...</em> He touched his lips where Hokuto’s warmth still lingered. <em>Maybe I’ll finally find the courage.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎄</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Red and gold tinsel sparkled under the function room’s chandeliers, matching the company colors that adorned every surface. Shintaro adjusted his cuffs, surveying the party from his position near the window. The speech had gone well — brief thanks for everyone’s hard work, wishes for the holiday season, the expected platitudes of a CEO. Now he could breathe easier, watching his employees enjoy themselves.</p><p>His eyes drifted inevitably to where Hokuto stood with the HR group, gesturing as he explained something to a junior staffer. The soft lighting caught the angles of his face, highlighting that tiny furrow of concentration between his brows. Even at a party, he maintained that air of quiet competence that had first drawn Shintaro’s attention.</p><p>“You’re staring again, shachou.”</p><p>Shintaro managed not to jump at Yugo’s sudden appearance beside him. The HR director clutched a glass of sparkling cider, his expression a mix of exasperation and concern.</p><p>“I’m observing the party,” Shintaro countered, though he knew his eyes had lingered too long in one direction.</p><p>“Mhm.” Yugo took a pointed sip. “Just like you were ‘observing’ during the quarterly review when Hokuto was presenting the efficiency reports. And during last week’s budget meeting. And—”</p><p>“I get the point.” Shintaro’s collar felt too tight. Trust Yugo to keep a mental catalog of every HR violation.</p><p>“Look.” Yugo lowered his voice. “I understand your... situation. And while I choose to temporarily overlook certain policy infractions due to our friendship, you can’t be this obvious in front of the whole company.”</p><p>Shintaro’s jaw clenched. As if he needed reminding of the rules he broke daily, of the careful dance they performed to maintain appearances. Of how even now, at a celebration, he couldn’t stand beside the person he wanted to share it with.</p><p>“The handbook specifically states—” Yugo began, but a hand clapped his shoulder.</p><p>“Give it a rest, Yugo.” Juri appeared with his own drink, rescue written in his easy smile. “It’s a party. No one’s thinking about handbooks right now.”</p><p>“Section 3.7 clearly outlines appropriate behavior at company functions—”</p><p>“Did you see the dessert table?” Juri cut in smoothly. “They have those little cakes you like. The ones with the gold leaf?”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes lit up despite his attempt to maintain his serious expression. “The ones from last year’s supplier?”</p><p>“Even better. Come on, I’ll show you.” Juri steered Yugo away with practiced ease, throwing Shintaro a wink over his shoulder.</p><p>Shintaro released a breath, grateful for the intervention.</p><p>Across the room, Hokuto glanced his way, a question in the slight tilt of his head.</p><p>Shintaro gave a tiny nod — <em>I’m fine</em> — watching as Hokuto returned to his conversation without missing a beat.</p><p><em>Perfect, appropriate, professional.</em> The words echoed in Shintaro’s mind as he observed the careful distance Hokuto maintained, the way he angled his body just so, never too familiar with anyone. Every movement calculated to deflect suspicion, to maintain their careful façade.</p><p>“There’s my favorite CEO.”</p><p>The familiar drawl made Shintaro turn. Ryutaro approached with his characteristic easy grace, designer suit impeccable despite the late hour. His brother had always moved through corporate events like he owned them, even when visiting other companies.</p><p>“I thought you had a client dinner,” Shintaro said.</p><p>“Wrapped early. Couldn’t miss the famous Morimoto Corp Christmas party.” Ryutaro snagged two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter, offering one to Shintaro. “Besides, I come bearing good news. Finally got Mom and Dad’s gift sorted.”</p><p>“Really?” Shintaro straightened. They’d been brainstorming for weeks, trading increasingly desperate texts about what to get parents who could buy anything they wanted.</p><p>“Remember that vintage tea ceremony set Hokuto mentioned? The one from that small artisan in Kanazawa?” Ryutaro’s eyes sparkled. “Turns out the craftsman was delighted to do a custom piece when I dropped the Morimoto name. Mom’s going to lose it.”</p><p><em>Of course Hokuto would know the perfect gift.</em> Warmth spread through Shintaro’s chest. His PA had listened to countless conversations about his mother’s tea ceremony obsession, filing away details neither brother had thought significant.</p><p>“That’s... actually perfect.” Shintaro took a sip of champagne to hide his smile. “When did he suggest it?”</p><p>“Last week when we had lunch. You know, the day you were ‘stuck in meetings.’” Ryutaro’s air quotes made Shintaro wince. “He’s good for you, you know. Notices things we miss.”</p><p>Shintaro’s eyes found Hokuto across the room again. Jesse had him cornered by the dessert table, gesturing wildly about something that had Hokuto fighting back laughter. The sight made something twist in Shintaro’s chest — that rare, unguarded smile he usually only saw in private moments.</p><p>“I’m thinking of telling them,” Shintaro said quietly. “During Christmas.”</p><p>Ryutaro’s champagne glass froze halfway to his lips. “About…?”</p><p>“Everything. Him. Us.” The words felt strange in the open air of the party, even whispered. “I’m tired of pretending he’s just my PA when he’s so much more.”</p><p>
  <em>I want him beside me at family dinners. Want to see him laugh like that at our table. Want to stop calculating every glance, every word, every movement.</em>
</p><p>“That’s…” Ryutaro set his glass down carefully. “Are you sure? Mom and Dad are…”</p><p>“Traditional? Set in their ways? Expecting grandchildren and a proper marriage?” The familiar weight of expectations settled on Shintaro’s shoulders. “Trust me, I know.”</p><p>“Does Hokuto know?”</p><p>“He doesn’t know yet.” Shintaro watched Hokuto’s profile, the way he politely covered his mouth to hide that laugh from Jesse’s antics. “I’ll tell him tonight.”</p><p>“And if things go badly with Mom and Dad?” Ryutaro’s voice held no judgment, just the practical concern of an older brother. “Do you have a backup plan?”</p><p>The question hit harder than it should have. Shintaro had spent countless hours imagining the moment of telling his parents, but never what came after if it went wrong. The thought of contingencies felt like admitting defeat before he’d begun.</p><p>“Shin.” Ryutaro’s tone softened. “You know I’ve got your back either way. But this isn’t just about you anymore.”</p><p><em>He’s right.</em> The realization settled cold in Shintaro’s stomach. He’d been so focused on his own need to stop hiding that he hadn't considered how it might affect Hokuto’s position at the company, his career, his life.</p><p>“Morimoto-shachou.” Hokuto’s voice cut through his spiral of thoughts. He approached with perfect professional distance, bowing slightly to both brothers. “Ryutaro-san.”</p><p>“Matsumura.” Ryutaro’s eyes crinkled with barely suppressed amusement at the formality. “Enjoying the party?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” Hokuto’s posture remained impeccable. “I apologize, but I need to head home early. The quarterly reports need final review before tomorrow’s meeting.”</p><p><em>The reports were finished yesterday.</em> Shintaro recognized their coded excuse — Hokuto using work as a cover to retreat to Shintaro’s apartment.</p><p>“Of course.” Ryutaro’s knowing look made heat creep up Shintaro’s neck. “Those reports are very important.”</p><p>“You have my permission to leave early, Matsumura.” Shintaro kept his voice steady, professional. “Please message me when you’ve finished the report.”</p><p>“Thank you, shachou.” Hokuto bowed again, the movement precise. “Ryutaro-san, please enjoy the rest of your evening.”</p><p>Shintaro watched him weave through the crowd toward the exit, maintaining that careful distance from everyone he passed. Even his departure was a masterclass in professional behavior — no lingering looks, no hesitation, nothing to suggest he was heading anywhere but his own apartment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎄</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The key turned in the lock with a familiar click. Christmas music drifted through the door before Shintaro even opened it, the soft melody of “White Christmas” making him pause.</p><p>Warm light spilled into the hallway as he pushed the door open. His sleek, minimalist apartment had transformed. Twinkling lights draped the windows, casting a soft glow across his modern furniture. A small but elegant Christmas tree perched on the coffee table, decorated in silver and blue ornaments that caught the light.</p><p>“You’re early.” Hokuto emerged from the kitchen, champagne bottle in hand. The Santa hat perched on his dark hair should have looked ridiculous. Instead, paired with those gray silk pajamas that hit just right at his hips, the effect was devastating.</p><p>“So are you.” Shintaro barely got his shoes off before Hokuto crossed the room to kiss him hello. He tried to deepen it, to pull Hokuto closer, but his boyfriend danced away with a teasing smile.</p><p>“Presents first.” Hokuto tugged him toward the couch. “What do you think?”</p><p>Shintaro let himself be led, taking in the subtle touches that had softened his bachelor pad. Crystal bowls filled with silver ornaments caught the light from strategically placed lamps. Garland wound elegantly around his entertainment center. Even his usual throw pillows had been swapped for festive ones in deep reds and silvers.</p><p>“It’s perfect.” He reached for Hokuto again, but got handed a champagne flute instead. “How did you manage all this?”</p><p>“I had help.” Hokuto settled beside him, tucking his feet under himself in that casual way that always made Shintaro’s chest tight. Here, away from work, he could finally be comfortable. “From Ryutaro-san.”</p><p>“Ryu-nii knows everything.” Shintaro took a sip of champagne, letting the bubbles dance on his tongue. “The tea set was a brilliant suggestion, by the way.”</p><p>“Haru-san mentioned her interest in traditional crafts last time I arranged her schedule.” Hokuto’s smile turned shy. “I just remembered the artisan’s name.”</p><p>“You always notice the details everyone else misses.” Shintaro reached out to adjust the Santa hat that had slipped slightly askew. The silk of Hokuto’s hair slid through his fingers. “It’s one of the thousand things I love about you.”</p><p>Pink crept across Hokuto’s cheeks at the compliment, but his eyes sparkled with determination as he leaned forward to grab something from under the coffee table. Two wrapped packages emerged — one in tasteful silver paper, the other in deep blue with snowflakes.</p><p>“The silver one is for tomorrow at the office,” Hokuto explained, holding out the blue package. “This one is... just from me. Not your PA.”</p><p>Shintaro’s heart skipped as he took the gift, the weight substantial in his hands. The paper fell away to reveal a sleek bike computer, top of the line with all the features he’d been eyeing for months. He’d mentioned wanting to track his routes better exactly once, during a late night when they were both punch-drunk from overtime.</p><p>“How did you—” He turned the box over, still processing. “I barely talked about this.”</p><p>“You get this look when you’re planning weekend rides.” Hokuto’s fingers fidgeted with his champagne glass. “Like you're mapping routes in your head. And you always check your phone for distance.”</p><p>The careful observation, the attention to detail that made Hokuto exceptional at his job, but directed at <em>him</em>– at his happiness – overwhelmed Shintaro. He set the bike computer down and cupped Hokuto’s face, kissing him deeply. Hokuto melted into it, tasting of champagne and something sweet he must have been sampling in the kitchen.</p><p>“Wait here.” Shintaro pulled back reluctantly. “My turn.”</p><p>He headed for his bedroom, where he’d hidden his own gifts. As he reached for the packages in his closet, he had to laugh. There, wrapped in understated black paper with a gold ribbon, sat the professional gift he’d selected for tomorrow. Beside it, in bright red paper decorated with golden stars, was his real gift – the one that had made him think only of Hokuto.</p><p><em>When did I start organizing my gift-giving like my PA?</em> The thought was fond as he gathered both packages. A year of Hokuto’s influence had him color-coding his personal life just like his work calendar. Somehow, that realization felt more intimate than sharing his bed.</p><p>Shintaro returned to the living room, where Hokuto had topped off their champagne glasses. The sight of him curled on the couch, Santa hat slightly crooked and silk pajamas reflecting the twinkling lights, made his heart race. He’d rehearsed this moment on the drive home, but now that it was here, his carefully planned words evaporated.</p><p>“The black one is for tomorrow,” he said, echoing Hokuto’s earlier explanation as he held out the red and gold package. “This is just from me. Not your CEO.”</p><p>Hokuto’s fingers traced the golden stars before carefully loosening the tape. Unlike Shintaro’s eager unwrapping earlier, he took his time, preserving the paper as if it were precious.</p><p>When he finally revealed the leather-bound volume of classical poetry he’d been admiring in the bookstore window for months, his intake of breath was soft but audible.</p><p>“Open it,” Shintaro urged, perching on the edge of the couch. His heart hammered against his ribs as Hokuto carefully lifted the cover.</p><p>A simple silver bracelet slid from between the pages, landing in Hokuto’s lap. The metal caught the Christmas lights as Hokuto lifted it, examining the subtle pattern etched into its surface — a continuous wave design that wrapped the entire circumference.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking,” Shintaro said, forcing himself to maintain eye contact despite the nervous energy coursing through him. “About Christmas with my family. About all the hiding and pretending.” He took a steadying breath. “I’m going to tell them. About us.”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes widened, the bracelet trembling slightly in his fingers. “Shintaro...”</p><p>“I know I can’t announce it to the world. The board, the shareholders – that’s complicated. But my family...” Shintaro reached out to steady Hokuto’s hand, feeling the slight tremor in it. “I want them to know who makes me happy. Who keeps me sane through endless meetings and actually remembers to feed me during deadlines.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Hokuto’s voice was barely above a whisper, his fingers tracing the wave pattern. “Your family... their expectations...”</p><p>“I’ve never been more sure of anything.” Shintaro touched the bracelet, aligning the pattern. “Except hiring you. And kissing you that first time in the conference room after everyone left.”</p><p>“You could lose everything.” Hokuto’s fingers stilled on the bracelet. “The board might force you to step down. Your parents... they’ve sacrificed so much for the company. For you.”</p><p>Shintaro’s stomach clenched. He’d run these scenarios in his head countless times over the past weeks. The thought of disappointing his father, of undoing decades of careful reputation building, made him feel physically ill.</p><p>But the alternative — continuing this exhausting dance of personas — felt impossible.</p><p>“I don’t have it all figured out yet,” he admitted. “But I'm tired. Tired of scheduling my happiness around other people’s expectations. Of watching every word, every gesture, in case someone notices how I look at you during meetings.”</p><p>“Your mother already suspects.” Hokuto’s voice was gentle but firm. “She watches us at work functions. And your lifestyle... the apartment, the cars, the freedom to pursue what you want...”</p><p>“None of it matters if I can’t be myself.” The words came out sharper than he intended. Shintaro softened his tone, lifting Hokuto's hand to press a kiss to his palm. “I’ve spent my whole life being the perfect son. The youngest who had to prove himself worthy of the Morimoto name. And I’m good at it — the meetings, the negotiations, the careful politics of it all. But I’m tired of that being all I am.”</p><p>Hokuto set the book carefully on the coffee table, the leather binding gleaming in the Christmas lights. For a long moment, he just studied Shintaro’s face. Whatever he saw there made something shift in his expression.</p><p>“Then we’ll face it together.” Hokuto held out his wrist. “Put it on properly?”</p><p>The simple acceptance, the quiet strength in those words, made Shintaro’s throat tight. His fingers trembled slightly as he fastened the bracelet, adjusting it until the wave pattern aligned perfectly.</p><p>Before he could pull away, Hokuto caught his hand.</p><p>“But promise me something.” Hokuto’s grip was firm, grounding. “We plan this carefully. No impulsive announcements at Christmas dinner because your mother makes one too many comments about marriage prospects.”</p><p>A startled laugh escaped Shintaro. Trust Hokuto to know exactly what he’d been tempted to do. “I promise. Though I can’t guarantee I won't break something if she shows me one more omiai profile.”</p><p>Hokuto kissed him then, slow and deep, tasting of champagne and certainty.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎄</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The empty champagne flutes clinked in Shintaro’s hands as he carried them to the kitchen. Behind him, Hokuto gathered the wrapping paper with his usual precise movements. The bracelet caught the light as he folded the paper, and Shintaro’s chest tightened at the sight. He’d spent weeks agonizing over that gift — something meaningful but subtle enough for daily wear. Something that marked Hokuto as <em>his</em> while still maintaining their professional façade.</p><p>In the bedroom, Shintaro stripped off his tie and jacket, watching Hokuto settle onto the bed with his new book. The silk pajamas Shintaro had given him last month draped perfectly over his slender frame, highlighting the elegant line of his waist. As Hokuto turned a page, the bracelet glinted against the dark fabric.</p><p>Shintaro’s fingers stilled on his shirt buttons. Hokuto looked utterly at home there, lounging against the headboard, long legs stretched out on the sheets. The sight made something possessive stir in Shintaro’s chest. This brilliant, composed man who kept his entire life running smoothly was <em>his</em>.</p><p>Instead of reaching for his own pajamas, Shintaro left his shirt hanging open and climbed onto the bed.</p><p>Hokuto glanced up at the movement, his eyes darkening as he took in Shintaro’s state of undress. The book lowered slowly to his lap. “I thought you were tired,” he said, but his voice had gone husky.</p><p>“Not that tired.” Shintaro prowled closer on his hands and knees, watching heat bloom in Hokuto’s cheeks. When he reached him, he plucked the book from unresisting fingers and set it carefully on the nightstand.</p><p>Hokuto’s lips parted on an inhale as Shintaro bracketed him with his arms. “The poetry—”</p><p>“Will still be there tomorrow.” Shintaro ducked his head to brush their lips together, feeling Hokuto’s sharp intake of breath. “Right now, I want to appreciate my other gift.”</p><p>He caught Hokuto’s mouth properly then, swallowing his soft sound of surrender. The kiss deepened instantly, Hokuto’s fingers sliding into his hair as Shintaro pressed him back against the pillows. They shifted together until Shintaro settled between Hokuto’s thighs, the silk of his pajamas cool against Shintaro’s bare chest.</p><p>Shintaro trailed his lips down Hokuto’s jaw to his neck, breathing in the clean scent of his skin. His fingers fumbled with the small buttons of the silk pajamas, distracted by the way Hokuto tilted his head to give better access. When Shintaro found a particularly sensitive spot, Hokuto’s breath hitched deliciously.</p><p>Finally getting the buttons undone, Shintaro pushed the fabric aside to reveal pale skin. He took his time exploring with lips and tongue, savoring each gasp and shiver.</p><p>When he reached a pink nipple, he circled it teasingly before taking it into his mouth. Hokuto’s back arched, a broken moan escaping his throat. The sound shot straight through Shintaro, making him suck harder.</p><p>Hokuto’s hands weren’t idle, pushing impatiently at his silk pants. Shintaro helped, tugging them down along with his underwear.</p><p>He sat back on his heels to drink in the sight — Hokuto sprawled naked against the dark sheets, skin flushed and gleaming in the low light. The silver bracelet at his wrist caught Shintaro’s eye, marking him as <em>claimed</em>. As <em>his</em>.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Shintaro murmured, leaning down to capture those parted lips again</p><p>The kiss turned deep and hungry as he reached blindly for the nightstand, fumbling for supplies. He coated his fingers liberally with lube, trailing them down between Hokuto’s spread thighs.</p><p>When he pressed one inside, he found little resistance — Hokuto was still loose from the night before.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Shintaro groaned against Hokuto’s mouth, arousal spiking hot in his veins at the discovery. His finger slid deeper, drawing a whimper from Hokuto that made Shintaro’s blood burn.</p><p>He worked a second, then a third, finger inside, watching Hokuto’s face contort with pleasure. His dark eyes fluttered shut, those perfect lips parting on a soft moan that made Shintaro’s remaining clothes feel impossibly tight. Seeing his composed PA come undone like this, knowing he was the only one who got to witness it, sent possessive heat coursing through him.</p><p>“Ready?” he asked, voice rough with need.</p><p>At Hokuto’s eager nod, he quickly shed his remaining clothes and settled between those long legs. The first push inside drew twin groans from their throats. Hokuto was hot and tight around him, legs wrapping instinctively around Shintaro’s waist to draw him deeper.</p><p>Shintaro braced himself on his forearms, pressing their foreheads together as he bottomed out. He could feel Hokuto’s rapid breaths against his lips, see the flutter of dark lashes as pleasure overwhelmed him. That bracelet caught the light again as Hokuto gripped his shoulders, the sight making Shintaro’s hips snap forward involuntarily.</p><p>The steady rhythm he tried to set quickly dissolved into something more desperate. Hokuto met each thrust eagerly, back arching to take him deeper. His usual composure had completely shattered, replaced by breathy moans and whispered pleas that made Shintaro’s blood burn.</p><p>Shintaro shifted his weight to one arm so he could slide his other hand between them, wrapping around Hokuto’s length. The touch made Hokuto cry out, head thrown back against the pillows. His neck was an irresistible target, and Shintaro latched onto the sensitive skin there as he stroked in time with his thrusts.</p><p>“<em>Shin</em>,” Hokuto gasped, fingers digging into his shoulders.</p><p>The way Hokuto said his name sent electricity down Shintaro's spine. He picked up his pace, driving deeper as Hokuto writhed beneath him. Those long legs tightened around his waist, changing the angle until Hokuto was sobbing with pleasure.</p><p>Shintaro could feel himself getting close, heat building at the base of his spine. He worked his hand faster, determined to bring Hokuto over the edge first.</p><p>When he felt those inner muscles start to clench around him, he captured Hokuto’s mouth in a deep kiss, swallowing his cry of completion. The sight and feel of Hokuto coming undone beneath him pushed Shintaro over the edge moments later, pleasure whiting out his vision as he spilled deep inside.</p><p>Afterglow settled over them like a warm blanket as they traded languid kisses. Hokuto’s lips were soft and pliant against his, moving with less coordination as exhaustion crept in.</p><p>Shintaro smiled against his mouth, recognizing the telltale signs. Like clockwork, Hokuto always drifted off after sex, his usual sharp focus melting into peaceful drowsiness.</p><p>Sure enough, Hokuto’s kisses grew slower, more unfocused. His hand, which had been lazily stroking Shintaro’s shoulder, fell limply to the sheets.</p><p>Shintaro pressed one last gentle kiss to those parted lips before carefully withdrawing from Hokuto’s body. A small sound of discomfort escaped Hokuto’s throat, but his eyes remained closed, dark lashes fanned against his flushed cheeks.</p><p>Shintaro padded to the en suite bathroom, his legs still a bit unsteady. The cool tile beneath his feet helped ground him as he reached for a washcloth. As he ran the warm water, his gaze landed on the neat toiletries bag perched on the vanity — the one Hokuto always packed and unpacked with military precision.</p><p>The sight of it made something in his chest constrict painfully. That bag represented everything wrong with their situation — how Hokuto had to carefully gather every trace of his presence whenever he left, ensuring nothing remained that might raise questions if Shintaro’s parents dropped by unannounced. No extra toothbrush in the holder, no favorite shampoo in the shower, no comfortable robe hanging on the hook.</p><p>The warm water ran over his fingers unnoticed as he stared at that innocuous bag. Inside would be travel-sized versions of everything — designed to be easily packed away, easily hidden.</p><p>Just like their relationship.</p><p>Even the drawer Shintaro had cleared for Hokuto’s clothes remained empty between visits, waiting for the next careful unpacking of a weekend bag.</p><p>His throat felt tight as he wrung out the washcloth. In the bedroom, Hokuto lay exactly as he’d left him, beautiful and vulnerable in sleep. The silver bracelet glinted on his wrist — the only thing of Shintaro’s he could safely keep with him. The only visible mark of their relationship, and even that had to be explained away if anyone asked.</p><p>He’d have to wake Hokuto early enough to erase all evidence of this night. The toiletries bag would be repacked, the drawer emptied, the sheets changed to remove any lingering scent of intimacy. By the time the sun rose, his apartment would look as pristine and impersonal as his office — no trace of the man who made both spaces feel like home.</p><p>Shintaro gently cleaned Hokuto’s skin with the warm washcloth, his touch reverent. Hokuto barely stirred, only making a soft sound of contentment when Shintaro’s hand brushed his thigh.</p><p>Even unconscious, he trusted Shintaro completely. The thought made his chest ache.</p><p>He tossed the washcloth in the general direction of the hamper, too reluctant to leave Hokuto’s warmth again. Sliding under the covers, he gathered Hokuto close, smiling when his lover immediately curled into him.</p><p>Hokuto’s head tucked perfectly under his chin, dark hair tickling Shintaro’s nose. The familiar weight of him settled something in Shintaro’s soul.</p><p>His fingers traced idle patterns on Hokuto’s bare shoulder as drowsiness crept in. The bracelet caught his eye again, silver gleaming against pale skin. Such a small thing to represent something so vast. His love for this man had become as essential as breathing, yet he kept it hidden away like something shameful.</p><p><em>No more</em>, he thought fiercely, tightening his arms around Hokuto. He was tired of watching Hokuto pack away pieces of himself, tired of pretending their relationship was nothing more than professional convenience. His parents deserved to know the truth — that their youngest son had found someone who made him better in every way. Someone who supported him, challenged him, completed him.</p><p>Christmas at the family villa suddenly felt less like a minefield and more like an opportunity. Yes, maintaining their secret would be harder with his mother’s sharp eyes on them.</p><p>But maybe... maybe that wasn't such a terrible thing.</p><p>Hokuto shifted in his arms, pressing closer with a contented sigh. The simple gesture of trust made Shintaro’s heart clench. He pressed a kiss to those dark strands, breathing in the familiar scent. He’d face whatever came, he decided as sleep pulled at him.</p><p>For this — for <em>them</em> — he’d find the courage.</p>
