<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Yugo straightens his tie and smooths down his hair as he approaches the row of cherry blossom trees in Ueno Park. His law firm’s annual cherry blossom viewing party is just getting started, with colleagues and clients mingling under the canopy of pink petals. Yugo isn’t usually one for company gatherings, but the cherry blossoms are hard to resist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kochi, great to see you!” his colleague Morimoto Shintaro calls out, waving him over to a group chatting near a picnic blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods in greeting. “Morimoto. Beautiful day for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It really is perfect timing this year,” Shintaro says. “Let me introduce you — this is Jesse Lewis, the event planner for today’s party.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo turns to the tall stranger Shintaro has indicated. “Nice to meet you, I’m Kochi Yugo,” he says, shaking the man’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pleasure to meet you, too,” Jesse replies smoothly. “I hope you enjoy the event today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Shintaro draws Jesse into a discussion about the catering, Yugo takes the chance to study the event planner. He looks to be in his late twenties, with fair skin and a friendly smile that lights up his dark eyes. His muscular frame is clad in a fitted slate suit that complements his height. Yugo hasn’t been expecting someone so striking when Kikuchi said they have hired an outside company to organize the party this year.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo wanders through the festivities over the next hour, keeping an eye out for Jesse’s tall figure. He tells himself he just wants to compliment the successful event, although he knows his interest is more than professional. It has been a long time since someone has caught his attention like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He finally spots Jesse near a large cherry blossom tree, gazing up at the branches. “Fantastic work today,” Yugo says, coming up beside him. “Our firm is very impressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why thank you, that’s so kind of you to say,” Jesse replies. “It’s been a pleasure working on this event.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They chat about the party details for a few minutes before Jesse says, “You know, I don't think I’ve ever seen sakura trees quite as beautiful as these. Would you mind showing me around the park a bit more after the party wraps up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo raises an eyebrow. “A personal tour?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you have time,” Jesse says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Is Yugo imagining the flirtatious note in his voice? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could make time,” he finds himself saying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wonderful.” Jesse’s eyes glint. “I look forward to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They exchange contact details, and a frisson of anticipation goes through Yugo as he walks away. He hasn’t expected to meet someone so magnetic today. And while he prefers keeping things casual on the romance front, Jesse intrigues him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the event ends, Jesse texts Yugo to meet him by the park’s Shinobazu Pond. The sun is lowering in the sky as they fall into step together along the water’s edge, providing a golden glow to the cherry blossoms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to say, this is even better without crowds of people around,” Jesse remarks, gesturing across the ripples of the pond towards flowering trees on the far bank.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nice this time of evening,” Yugo agrees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stroll in comfortable silence for a few minutes, passing under the boughs of weeping cherry trees. Yugo sneaks a sideways glance at his companion. The setting sun light’s up Jesse’s strong profile and muscular frame. Yugo quickly looks away before Jesse can catch him staring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Kochi-san, what do you like to do for fun besides walk in picturesque parks?” Jesse asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo chuckles. “Please drop the honorific. Well, I enjoy travel and hiking in my free time. Testing my limits against nature provides a thrill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An outdoorsman, how refreshing.” Jesse smiles. “And does this desire for adventure apply to all areas of your life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo hesitates before answering carefully. “In some areas, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse gives him a knowing look. “But not when it comes to affairs of the heart?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taken aback by his astuteness, Yugo pauses before replying. “You could say that. I tend to be cautious in romance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I get that. Though sometimes risks bring rewards.” Jesse’s eyes hold his, and Yugo feels an unexpected swoop in his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse steps closer, and Yugo notices his citrusy cologne mixing pleasantly with the scent of cherry blossom petals. Without thinking, he closes the gap between them and presses his lips to Jesse’s. Jesse responds instantly, kissing him back hungrily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally break apart for air, Jesse’s eyes are dark, pupils dilated. “My place isn’t far. Wanna get out of here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s rational side knows this fling will be fleeting. But with Jesse’s thigh pressed against his own, reason is difficult to come by. “Yes,” he breathes, the whispered word loud in the twilight air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s answering smile is electric.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They take the train to Jesse’s apartment in comfortable anticipation. As soon as the door closes behind him, Jesse pulls Yugo close, finding his mouth again like a man dying of thirst. Yugo returns the blistering kisses, hands roaming urgently over Jesse’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse maneuvers them towards the bedroom, shedding clothing along the way, urgent but still gentle. He pushes Yugo down onto silky gray sheets, straddling him with a knee on either side of his hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have protection?” Yugo asks. At Jesse’s nod, he relaxes back against the pillows, trailing his hands along the firm muscles of Jesse’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s caresses are sure but unhurried, his full lips blazing a trail down Yugo’s body. Yugo’s breath comes faster, hands clenching Jesse’s shoulders, as he gives himself over to sensation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Afterwards, they lie wrapped in each other’s arms, skin dewy with sweat. Yugo’s heartbeat slowly calmed as he drifts in post-coital bliss. Jesse’s thumb traces idle patterns on his shoulder as they trade languorous kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Under other circumstances, Yugo would have let himself be lulled to sleep by the comforting weight of Jesse’s body. But he knows this can’t lead anywhere beyond tonight. Reluctantly, he disentangles himself from Jesse’s embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should get going. Early meeting tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse blinks up at him, surprise flitting across his handsome features before being replaced by resignation. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo quickly dresses under Jesse’s silent gaze. At the bedroom door, he pauses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had a nice time tonight.” The words feel inadequate for the complexity of the evening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse gives a rueful half smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “I did too. Take care, Kochi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside, cool night air brushes Yugo’s skin as he walks to the station. He touches his fingers to his lips, still tingling from Jesse’s kisses, and tries not to imagine the hurt that might be lurking behind the other man’s nonchalant farewell.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This was for the best</span>
</em>
<span>, he tells himself firmly. Their paths are unlikely to cross again. Jesse will forget this fleeting encounter soon enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, Yugo has a feeling those dark eyes and warm caresses will linger in his memory long after the cherry blossoms have scattered from the trees.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This place is massive,” Yugo remarks, gaze roving over the sprawling outlet store. “Where should we even start?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His best friend, Taiga, shrugs, already focused on a display of winter jackets. “Let’s just take a look around. We’ve got time before they close.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods and falls into step beside Taiga as he browses through the men’s section. They are shopping for gear for their upcoming camping trip in Nikko National Park. Yugo can already envision the sweep of mountains they’ll see from their tent doorway at sunrise. He lives for the sharp thrill of pushing his limits against the power of nature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, check this out,” Taiga says, holding up a water-resistant parka. “You think this could withstand some spring showers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo inspects the coat critically. “Maybe. But I’d want something heavier duty for the type of conditions we might hit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good point.” Taiga hangs the jacket back up. “I’ll never match your outdoors expertise. But I figure I should at least get some better equipment so I’m not totally slowing us down on these trips.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo smiles and claps a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “You don’t slow me down. I’m just glad you humor me on these adventures.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s true — Yugo appreciates Taiga’s companionship in the wilderness, despite his lack of athleticism. They balance each other out nicely. Where Yugo thrives on high-stakes risks and pushing limits, Taiga prefers strategy and preparation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s mind wanders as Taiga debates the merits of different hiking boots. The outlet store’s piped-in music switches to a romantic ballad, and his thoughts drift to Jesse from the cherry blossom party almost two weeks ago. He hasn’t reached out to Jesse after their tryst, too cautious to turn a fleeting passion into anything more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But something about Jesse has gotten under his skin. Yugo rubs the back of his neck, remembering the glide of Jesse’s strong hands there.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re pretty quiet over there,” Taiga observes, breaking into his reverie. “Everything okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo shrugs. “Yeah, all good. Just thinking about our Nikko plans.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s sharp eyes narrow. “I know that look. This is about a guy, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No!” Yugo scoffs, turning away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s written all over your face. Come on, spill it.” Taiga crosses his arms expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo hesitates. If anyone would understand his dating hesitations, it’s Taiga. “Well … I did meet someone recently.” He gives Taiga a brief rundown of meeting Jesse at the cherry blossom event. “But you know how I am. We hooked up, and I bailed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga nods thoughtfully. “I get why you’re cautious after things ended with … you know. But not every relationship will be like that trainwreck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo sighs. “You’re probably right. But this guy was just a one-night thing. I doubt I’ll see him again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, a familiar figure strolling through the menswear section catches Yugo’s eye. He freezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga follows his stunned gaze. “I’m guessing that’s him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo can only nod mutely as Jesse looks up and notices them. Jesse’s eyes widen in surprise before his expression settles into a polite smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fancy running into you here,” Jesse says as he approaches them. “How have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, thanks.” Yugo resists the urge to fidget under Jesse’s gaze. “Jesse, this is my friend, Kyomoto Taiga. Taiga, this is Jesse Lewis. He organized our firm’s cherry blossom viewing party a couple of weeks ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two men exchange greetings. An awkward beat passes before Taiga says, “Well, Yugo, I’ll keep looking around. Catch up with you in a bit.” He walks off, winking at Yugo over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse watches Taiga leave before turning back to Yugo. “I have to admit, after I didn’t hear from you, I assumed you wanted to keep our night together a one-time thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo flushes. “Yeah, sorry about that. I’m not the best at follow-through after first dates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of Jesse’s eyebrows quirk up. “First date, was it?” His eyes glint with humor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know what I mean,” Yugo says, rubbing his neck again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s expression softens. “I do. And I get it  — no expectations here.” He hesitates before continuing. “But … I did enjoy our time together. If you ever wanted to grab dinner sometime, I’d be open to that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest tightens at the subtle hopefulness in Jesse’s voice. Impulsively, he says, “Yeah, maybe we could do that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse looks surprised but pleased. “Great. Whenever you’re free, let me know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They say polite goodbyes before Jesse continues his shopping. Yugo slowly walks over to where Taiga is pretending to be engrossed in fleece jackets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s gaze is triumphant. “See! He’s clearly interested. You should give it a shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo grimaces. “We’ll see. Either way, you’re not allowed to meddle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga holds up his hands. “No meddling, got it.” But his eyes are bright with affectionate scheming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Shaking his head ruefully, Yugo turns his focus back to their shopping trip. But Jesse’s warm eyes linger at the edges of his thoughts.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo checks his watch as he exits the office building, briefcase in hand. It’s 6:45 pm on Thursday night, and he’s meeting Jesse for dinner in Ginza in fifteen minutes. They had arranged their official “first date” the same day Yugo promised to go on a date with him. Yugo feels a mix of anticipation and nerves twisting his stomach into knots.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he navigates through the Station, the evening rush hour crowds jostling him along, a familiar head of curls catches his eye. Jesse is up ahead, scrolling through his phone. Before Yugo can debate whether to approach him, Jesse glances up and notices him. A smile breaks over his handsome face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yugo, hey! Running a bit late too, I see,” Jesse says as Yugo reaches him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, meeting ran over,” Yugo replies, hoping Jesse doesn’t notice the slight breathlessness in his voice at their sudden proximity. “I was just heading to Ginza.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What a coincidence, me too! We might as well go together then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They make their way to the platform. As the train pulls up, Yugo steels himself for close quarters and steps into the crowded car after Jesse. They end up pressed together, Jesse’s firm chest against Yugo’s back and his breath stirring Yugo’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo forces himself to relax. They’re simply two commuters in a busy train. Even if his senses are hyper-aware of Jesse’s muscular frame aligned with his own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After what feels like an eternity, they finally reach Ginza Station and extract themselves from the press of bodies. Yugo can breathe normally again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we?” Jesse asks with a crooked smile, gesturing toward the station exit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods and falls into step beside him as they head to the restaurant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrive at the cozy sushi spot, the owner greets Jesse with a friendly shout. “Jesse, wonderful to see you again!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse clasps hands warmly with the older man. “Akira-san, I’m so glad we could make it in tonight. This is my friend Yugo.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome, welcome!” Takumi says jovially, ushering them to the polished counter. “Any friend of Jesse’s receives the VIP treatment here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they’re settled with menus, Yugo quirks an eyebrow at Jesse. “So you bring all your first dates to your personal sushi chef?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse laughs. “Akira is an old family friend. I helped his son get an internship at the company a few years back. So now I get the ‘special rate.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, I should have guessed you’d have friends in high places, Mr. Social Butterfly,” Yugo teases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say, I thrive on people,” Jesse says with an easy grin. “Keeping up with everyone does take work though. Lots of coffee dates and catch-up calls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo shakes his head, amused. Outgoing and personable Jesse is such a contrast to his own reserved nature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they’ve placed their orders, Jesse’s expression grows more serious. “Yugo, before we get into lighter topics, I want to say upfront how much I appreciate you being here tonight.” He meets Yugo’s gaze. “If I’m being honest, when you actually texted me to set plans, I was shocked. I was certain you’d end up canceling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest tightens with guilt. “Jesse …”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jesse holds up a hand. “It’s okay, really. I don’t mean it as an accusation. I just want you to know that I’m grateful you kept our date, because I do want to get to know you better. Even if this goes nowhere beyond tonight, it means a lot that you took a chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s sincerity disarms Yugo. “You have nothing to thank me for. I’m the one who should be grateful that you still wanted to see me again after I disappeared on you.” He offers a small smile. “But I’m glad I’m here too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse beams, the warmth in his eyes kindling an answering glow in Yugo’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Akira serves up plate after plate of succulent sushi, Yugo finds himself relaxing, Jesse’s easygoing presence thawing his habitual wariness. They trade stories about life in Tokyo and discover mutual interests in live music, gaming, and sci-fi.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, important question,” Jesse says, pointing his chopsticks at Yugo. “What’s your favorite place you’ve ever hiked or climbed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo doesn’t have to think twice. “Definitely Mt. Fuji. I know it’s a tourist destination, but there’s something magical about watching the sunrise from the summit after a tough overnight climb. All your aches and fatigue just disappear at that moment.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He tells Jesse more about his Mt. Fuji adventures, describing the camaraderie with fellow climbers and the adrenaline rush of reaching the top. Jesse listens intently, chin propped on one hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It sounds incredible,” he says when Yugo finishes. “You’ll have to take me sometime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The casual assumption that they’ll be spending more time together makes Yugo’s pulse stutter. “Maybe I will,” he says, holding Jesse’s warm gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation flows easily through the rest of their meal. But underneath the banter, an undercurrent thrums between them, born from charged looks and knees brushing under the counter. As they share matcha ice cream for dessert, Jesse rests his hand on Yugo’s thigh, just for a moment. The contact sears Yugo even through his trousers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After declining sake in favor of clear heads, Jesse asks for the check. Yugo’s heart beats faster, knowing what he wants but uncertain how to initiate it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they exit the restaurant, he clears his throat. “Would you maybe want to … continue the evening at your place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s eyes darken, but his tone remains neutral. “I’m happy with whatever you’re comfortable with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo hears the unspoken invitation. “Your place sounds good,” he says, pulse thundering in his ears.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay then.” Jesse’s hand finds the small of Yugo’s back, guiding him to the station.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The atmosphere between them simmers with charged anticipation on the train ride to Jesse’s apartment. As soon as the door closes behind them, Jesse presses Yugo against it, capturing his gasp with a searing kiss. Yugo winds his arms around Jesse’s strong shoulders, kissing back fiercely. They undress each other with urgent hands, mouths hungry and seeking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Yugo finally collapses back onto the pillows afterwards, body thrumming with euphoria, he knows he should leave like last time. But Jesse’s chest is warm against his back, his breathing deep and even.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo tells himself he’ll get up to go in just a few more minutes. But Jesse’s steady heartbeat and the hypnotic rise and fall of his chest lull Yugo into an exhausted sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Morning sunlight streaming through the window wakes him. For a dizzying moment, Yugo doesn’t know where he is. Then awareness rushes back in. Jesse lies beside him, still deep in slumber. Yugo’s spent the night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Panic flares in his chest. This is veering into relationship territory, the very thing he’s avoided for years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo repeats the thought like a mantra as sunlight continues to brighten the bedroom. He knows the sensible thing would be to slip away before Jesse awakens, avoiding any awkwardness. But the warm solidity of Jesse's body next to his tethers Yugo in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo repeats the thought like a mantra as sunlight continues to brighten the bedroom. He knows the sensible thing would be to slip away before Jesse awakens, avoiding any awkwardness. But the warm solidity of Jesse’s body next to his tethers Yugo in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few more minutes, Jesse begins to stir. His eyes blink open, landing on Yugo. A smile spreads across his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” he says, his voice still husky with sleep. “This is a nice surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s cheeks heat. “Yeah, sorry, you just wore me out last night,” he deflects lightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s smile widens, but he doesn’t push the implied meaning behind Yugo staying. “I’ll take that as a compliment.” He stretches, muscles flexing enticingly, before sitting up. “I don’t have anywhere to be until later this morning. But I’m sure you need to get ready for work?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The reasonable assumption jolts Yugo fully awake. “Shit, what time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just after six.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo groans, running a hand through his hair. His normal work routine is shot. But when he glances back at Jesse’s sleep-rumpled form, he can’t bring himself to regret it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t you grab a quick shower here while I make us some breakfast?” Jesse offers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo hesitates but nods. He can worry about the implications later. Right now, a warm shower and food sound amazing. “Thanks. I’ll try to be quick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take your time.” Jesse’s fingers trail lightly down his arm as he gets out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo suppresses a shiver at the touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the shower, enveloped in clouds of steam, clarity returns to Yugo’s mind. What is he doing? He never spends the night with dates, never mind accepting morning-after breakfast at their place. Panic bubbles up as he realizes how easily he’s slipping into relationship behavior with Jesse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe it would be better to quit while they’re ahead, before this goes any further. Jesse said he understands Yugo’s tendency to pull away. Surely he’d accept it if Yugo said this needed to be their last date. It’s the sensible thing to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling decided, Yugo shuts off the water and dries himself briskly. But when he exits the bathroom, his resolve weakens. Jesse has laid out Yugo’s clothes from yesterday, crisply folded on the bed. The caring gesture makes Yugo’s chest ache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking a deep breath, he dresses and heads to the kitchen. The scent of miso soup and grilled fish surrounds him. Jesse stands at the stove, humming to himself. He’s still in pajamas, hair endearingly mussed. When he notices Yugo, his face lights up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just in time! Grab a seat, breakfast is ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo sits at the small dining table as Jesse brings over dishes laden with food — rice, tamagoyaki, pickled vegetables, and seared salmon. Despite Yugo’s tumultuous emotions, his stomach growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This looks amazing, thank you,” he says sincerely as Jesse sits across from him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m no five-star chef, but I can assure you it’s edible.” Jesse passes Yugo a pair of chopsticks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The simple meal tastes incredible. They chat lightly between bites about weekend plans and favorite breakfast foods. Yugo’s nerves settle somewhat in the comfortable domesticity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too soon, the food is gone and reality creeps back in. Jesse seems to sense Yugo’s shift in mood. “I’ll clean up. Don’t want to make you late for work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo stands reluctantly. “Yeah, I should get going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the entranceway, he slides on his shoes and straightens his rumpled suit, hyperaware of Jesse’s eyes on him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks again for everything. I appreciate it,” Yugo says formally. His resolved ending words stick in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse smiles, a glimmer of wistfulness in his eyes. “Of course. I’m glad you stayed.” He hesitates slightly. “Let me know if you want to get together again sometime?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question hangs in the air between them. Yugo knows he should shake his head, politely turn Jesse down. But the earnest hopefulness on his face cracks Yugo’s defenses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, I’ll be in touch,” he finds himself saying instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s answering smile is like the sun emerging on a cloudy day. “Great!” He leans to kiss Yugo on the lips. “Have a good day at work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo ducks out the door into the morning sunlight, heart and mind swirling with confusion. He touches his fingers to his lips, tingling from Jesse’s goodbye kiss, and wonders how long he can cling to his old patterns before something has to give.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo takes a deep breath, inhaling the crisp morning air as he and Taiga hike up the forested trail. Early spring sunlight filters through the canopy overhead, dappling the path. In the distance, a mountain stream gurgles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo has always loved the sharp thrill of pushing his limits against the power of nature. As a child, he was forever climbing trees and racing bicycles down steep hills, addicted to the rush of adrenaline when cheating gravity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He remembers the time when he was eight, perched at the top of a giant tree in his backyard. As he clung to the thin upper branches swaying in the wind, he felt like a bird about to take flight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In college, he found a teenage version of that weightless euphoria by cliff diving with friends along a rocky coastline. He lived for the breathless seconds of free fall, wind whistling in his ears, before hitting the surface in an explosion of foam. Adventure pumps through his veins like lifeblood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet if Yugo is passionate about thrill-seeking, he is cautious when it comes to affairs of the heart. A boyfriend would only slow him down, or so he’s always told himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His one major relationship was with a boy named Ryo during senior year of high school. They shared a love of literature and debate that initially drew Yugo in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Ryo’s spontaneous, artistic nature that had intrigued Yugo at first eventually became a source of conflict. Where Yugo preferred order and predictability, Ryo was impulsive and emotionally volatile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The messy breakup occurred in their third year of college after Ryo confessed he had developed feelings for someone else, taking Yugo completely by surprise. He was devastated, left questioning his judgment in matters of romance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ever since, he’s shied away from any hint of commitment, guarding his heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s voice breaks into his reverie. “We’re here! Man, I’m ready to just collapse for a while.” He drops his pack gratefully, rotating his shoulders with a wince.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo surveys the clearing, ringed by towering pines. A creek gurgles nearby. It’s perfect. “Yeah, let’s get camp set up and we can rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They work together to pitch the tent and gather firewood. Once the campsite is arranged to Yugo’s satisfaction, they sit against their packs and hydrate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga eyes him over the rim of his water bottle. “So, tell me what’s new. How are things going with that Jesse guy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo tenses involuntarily. He should have known Taiga wouldn’t let it go for long, perceptive as he is. “We’ve hung out a few more times. But we’re keeping things casual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmhm.” Taiga’s gaze drops to Yugo’s neck, and he smirks. “Is that one of Jesse’s </span>
<em>
<span>casual</span>
</em>
<span> marks on your neck then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo resists the urge to clamp a hand over the hickey he’d noticed in the mirror this morning, a souvenir from last night’s activities. He feels his face heating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga laughs. “Come on, you obviously like him! And it seems clear he’s into you too. I say go for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo picks at a frayed cuff on his sleeve, considering his words. “I don’t know. After everything with Ryo, the idea of a real relationship terrifies me. What if I’m wrong about him too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sympathy fills Taiga’s expression. He moves to sit beside Yugo, shoulders touching companionably.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get why you’re hesitant to open up again after last time. But not every guy will be like your ex. And you can’t let one bad experience close you off forever.” He nudges Yugo with his elbow. “Take a risk! Fortune favors the brave, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo huffs a laugh at having his own motto quoted back at him. But the swooping thrill of a bungee jump feels infinitely safer than the free fall of romance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” he says slowly. “Ryo really messed with my ability to trust. I think it's going to take some time before I’m ready for anything serious again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga nods understandingly. “That’s fair. Just remember it’s also okay to let your guard down when the time and person feel right. I’ve got your back either way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo smiles gratefully. “Thanks, Taiga. For now can we please just enjoy the hiking and camping? Relationships are giving me a headache.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga grins and claps him on the back. “Absolutely. What do you say we catch some dinner from that stream?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Relieved by his friend’s easy acceptance, Yugo pushes thoughts of Jesse from his mind. Out here surrounded by pine trees, with dinner and campfire ahead, is exactly where he wants to be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The future can wait a little longer.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo sits in the parking lot, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel as he waits for Jesse to emerge from his apartment building. He still can’t believe he impulsively asked Jesse to spend the day with him at the Ghibli Park. When a client had given Yugo two complimentary tickets, Jesse was the first person who came to mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before he could overthink it, Yugo had texted the invitation. To his pleasant surprise, Jesse enthusiastically agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And now here they are, about to embark on a spontaneous day trip together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo spots Jesse exiting the front doors with a small backpack and waves him over. “Morning! Ready for the road?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely.” Jesse grins as he climbs into the passenger seat. “I’m so excited. I’ve been dying to visit the park ever since it opened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They chat casually as Yugo navigates out of the city towards Nagoya. Around an hour into the drive, he stifles a yawn, the early start catching up with him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse notices immediately. “Why don’t we stop at the next rest area for some coffee? My treat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo wants to protest that he’s fine, but the genuinely concerned look on Jesse’s face makes him smile instead. “Yeah, good call. Coffee would be great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the service area, Jesse heads inside and returns shortly with two steaming cups. The rich aroma instantly revives Yugo as he takes a sip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, I needed this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime.” Jesse’s hand finds Yugo’s knee, giving a brief, warm squeeze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s stomach flutters at the casual intimacy of the gesture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Back on the road, the coffee fuels lively debates over which Studio Ghibli film is superior. Jesse argues spiritedly for </span>
<em>
<span>Howl’s Moving Castle</span>
</em>
<span> while Yugo insists </span>
<em>
<span>My Neighbor Totoro</span>
</em>
<span> can’t be topped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agree to disagree,” Jesse finally concedes, laughing. “Though I know we’ll both love seeing the park brought to life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods, returning his eyes to the road. He almost can’t believe he’s on a romantic day trip with someone he genuinely enjoys spending time with. It’s been years since he let his guard down this way. The realization leaves him feeling both thrilled and anxious.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally reach the park gates, Yugo parallel parks while Jesse grabs their tickets. Seeing Jesse’s eager smile as he returns makes Yugo’s reservations melt away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He grins back. “Ready for some magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They spend the day immersed in Ghibli worlds, leaving everyday life far behind. They watch a short film at the cinema. Jesse convinces a reluctant Yugo to pose in a replica of the mysterious sea railway train in </span>
<em>
<span>Spirited Away</span>
</em>
<span> and sit next to No Face. And they both laugh themselves silly in the Cat Bus room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While waiting in line for themed pastries, Yugo says, “You know, Totoro was my favorite movie as a kid. My parents said I used to try to wait up all night to see the Catbus.” He pauses, smile fading. “Seeing it now actually reminds me a lot of them. We’d always watch it together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse seems to detect the change in his tone. “Hey, there’s a nice garden just ahead. Wanna take a walk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods, suddenly needing the fresh air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They detour to the secluded garden with a small pond that Jesse spotted on the map. Finding a stone bench tucked away from other visitors, they sit facing the water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo rubs his hands together, trying to shape his thoughts. “Seeing Totoro today made me think about when I was close with my parents as a kid. Before everything got complicated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He goes on to tell Jesse about how his relationship with his traditional parents soured in high school when he came out as gay. The resulting arguments and silence caused a rift in the family that never fully healed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think that’s part of why my ex was able to hurt me so deeply,” he admits quietly. “My family ties were already damaged. I had no foundation. That’s why I …” He swallows. “I’m just always scared to commit to another relationship.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse takes Yugo’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “I’m so sorry you went through all that. But thank you for opening up to me about it.” His eyes are full of kindness. “I want you to know I’d never rush or pressure you into anything you aren’t ready for. I just like being with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest tightens. He doesn't feel deserving of this patient, wonderful man. But the fact Jesse wants to remain close despite his relationship baggage means more than he can express. “Thank you,” he says simply, hoping his eyes convey what his words cannot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse seems to understand. He lifts Yugo’s hand, brushing a soft kiss to his knuckles that sends shivers down his spine. “Anytime.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night at a love hotel, Jesse's hands glide reverently across Yugo’s bare skin, gentle but passionate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Basking in the afterglow, Yugo vows to himself that he’ll try to be braver, like the boy who once waited up nights for magic. Fortune favors the brave, after all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Jesse is worth taking that leap.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo glances at his watch as he and Jesse stroll through the park, weaving around families and couples enjoying the sunny spring day. “Taiga said they’d meet us by the lotus pond at 1pm. They should be here soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds good!” Jesse smiles, face tilting up to soak in the warm rays. “It was really nice of them to suggest a double date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods, hoping his nerves aren’t obvious. When Taiga had proposed getting together with him and Hokuto, Yugo knew it would mean introducing Jesse as more than a friend. He cares about Jesse deeply, but putting a label on things still makes his pulse quicken anxiously.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Baby steps</span>
</em>
<span>, he reminds himself, taking a deep breath of fresh air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon Taiga’s figure comes into view waving at them near the tranquil pond, Hokuto beside him. Yugo lifts a hand in return.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yugo, Jesse! Good to see you both.” Taiga pulls Yugo into a quick hug before turning to Jesse. “I don't think we've been properly introduced. I’m Kyomoto Taiga, Yugo’s best friend."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lovely to meet you, Kyomoto.” Jesse exchanges a polite bow with him. “And you must be Matsumura Hokuto?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s me.” Hokuto, a slender man with gentle eyes, smiles warmly at them. “So happy you could join us today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The four of them begin strolling along the pond’s edge, making small talk about work and hobbies. Yugo stays close to Jesse’s side, hyperaware of their proximity. He reminds himself that they’re with safe company. This is just two couples enjoying a normal double date.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pass a small ice cream stand, Yugo seizes on the idea. “Anyone want a cone? My treat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh yes, great idea!” Taiga says. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The others chime in with agreement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t you guys grab a bench, and Jesse and I will get the ice cream.” Yugo meets Jesse’s eyes, heart skipping when he smiles back softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In line for the ice cream, Jesse asks, “So how are you feeling about today? I know me meeting your best friend means a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo exhales. “Yeah, it feels like a big step. But mostly I’m just really happy you’re here with me.” The admission comes easier than he expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s grin is bright as sunlight. “Me too. Thank you for inviting me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Arms laden with cones, they rejoin the others on a park bench. Yugo passes out the treats, making sure to hand Jesse his personal favorite matcha flavor. Jesse’s eyes crinkle with happiness at the small gesture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The four chat and people-watch as they eat their ice cream in the dappled sun. Yugo finds himself observing Taiga and Hokuto’s casual intimacy — Hokuto wiping a smudge of ice cream from Taiga’s chin, Taiga’s arm draped casually around Hokuto’s shoulders. They move in effortless sync, like binary stars locked in orbit. Witnessing such easy affection still amazes Yugo.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stroll around the pond after finishing their ice cream, Taiga says, “Oh Yugo, I meant to tell you — I heard about an amazing hiking trail to a waterfall in Okutama. We should check it out soon!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo's eyes light up. “That sounds awesome. I’m always down for finding new trails.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, I’d love to see a waterfall!” Hokuto chimes in. “Would you mind an extra hiker coming along?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga smiles and squeezes his hand. “Of course, the more the merrier!” He glances at Yugo. “Do you think Jesse would want to join too? Could make it a fun group outing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo hesitates briefly before turning to Jesse. “What do you think? Wanna take on a canyon hike with us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To his pleasant surprise, Jesse smiles. “I’m not the most outdoorsy, but exploring a new place with you sounds great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Warmth spreads through Yugo’s chest. “It’s a date then. I’ll look into the trail details so we can plan a day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse and Hokuto chat excitedly about what to expect as they continue walking. Yugo catches Taiga’s eye, mouthing a sincere “thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga winks back subtly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Too soon, the sun begins its descent towards the Tokyo skyline. Taiga stretches and stands. “This was so nice, but unfortunately we have dinner plans this evening.” He smiles at Yugo and Jesse. “We should all do this again soon though!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto nods enthusiastically. “Absolutely! It was wonderful getting to know you, Jesse.” He and Taiga exchange goodbyes and head towards the park exit hand-in-hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo turns to see Jesse watching him with a soft look. “They seem like really good people. I can tell how much they care about you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, they’ve always been so supportive.” Yugo ducks his head. “And only mildly embarrassing today, so I’ll call it a success.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse laughs. “High praise indeed!” His expression grows serious. “But truly … thank you again for inviting me to join your important people. It means a lot that you’re letting me into your world more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest clenches. Not trusting his voice, he simply slips his hand into Jesse’s and squeezes gently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse squeezes back just as firmly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Together they walk in comfortable silence through the cherry tree grove, emerging blossoms perfuming the evening air around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortune favors the brave, Yugo reminds himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And something about Jesse’s steadfast presence at his side makes him feel brave enough to take the next leap.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo grabs a cart as he enters the grocery store, thoughts occupied with what to make for dinner. As he passes through the produce section, the bunches of fresh herbs remind him of Jesse’s little garden on his apartment balcony.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On impulse, Yugo detours down a side aisle filled with gardening supplies. He smiles, picturing how Jesse’s face would light up at a small gift to enhance his new hobby. Yugo selects a cute terra cotta planter and mini watering can, hoping Jesse will appreciate the gesture.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gift stowed in the cart, Yugo returns to grocery shopping, grabbing vegetables and noodles for a stir fry. As he nears the beverages, he slows. Was that Jesse? It’s hard to miss him when he’s tall, blonde, and dressed in neon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peering around the corner, Yugo spots Jesse studying the tea selection. He’s with another man Yugo doesn’t recognize, dressed smartly in slacks and a button-down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not wanting to interrupt, Yugo hangs back. But he can’t resist watching Jesse for a moment, broad shoulders stretching his simple t-shirt as he reaches for a box of green tea. Yugo is about to head down another aisle when Jesse’s companion’s voice stops him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly, Jesse, I don’t get why you turned down Rika for that date. She’s perfect for you — beautiful, successful …”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse sighs, clearly this is an old argument. “Juri, we've been over this. I’m seeing someone right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean that guy with all the relationship baggage?” Juri scoffs. “Come on, don’t let some emotional mess stop you from meeting an amazing woman like Rika.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo stiffens, the words piercing. Baggage? Is that how Jesse talks about him to friends?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Jesse’s frown is stern. “Don’t call him that. I really care about Yugo. I’m happy to be patient and wait until he’s ready for more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Juri snorts. “And how long are you willing to wait exactly? What if he just keeps stringing you along?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s enough.” Jesse’s voice is sharp. “This isn’t your business. Yugo’s worth waiting for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He seems to realize his volume has risen and glances around nervously. His eyes meet Yugo’s, widening in dismay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest tightens unbearably. The half-filled cart feels suddenly heavy in his hands. Blindly, he shoves it aside and rushes for the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He’s nearly to the doors when hurried footsteps sound behind him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yugo, wait!” Jesse catches his arm gently. “I’m so sorry you heard that. Juri is a good friend but he can be really insensitive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo shakes his head bitterly, avoiding Jesse’s eyes. “Maybe he had a point though. What if I can never give you a real relationship? You deserve more than I can offer right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s hands come up to cup Yugo’s face, forcing their gazes to meet. “Listen to me. I meant what I said back there. I care about you so much, Yugo. I’m happy with whatever you’re comfortable with, no pressure for more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Emotion clogs Yugo’s throat. He searches Jesse’s earnest eyes but finds only sincerity and care shining back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just need a little space to think right now,” he manages quietly. “But thank you. For being patient with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s shoulders slump but he steps back. “Of course. Take all the time you need.” His eyes are sad but understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Impulsively, Yugo grabs his hand. “Wait. I left something for you in my cart, back in the tea aisle. It’s silly but … I saw it and thought of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse looks surprised but squeezes Yugo’s hand. “You didn’t have to do that, but thank you. I appreciate it.” A tentative smile. “I’ll see you soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo nods numbly, the interaction already feeling distant and hazy. As soon as Jesse disappears back inside, he turns and walks quickly home, appetite vanished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His mind swirls with doubt and fear. No matter how sincerely Jesse defended him, the truth remains that he has too much baggage to be a good partner right now. Jesse may be content to wait for Yugo to be ready, but who knows if that day will ever come? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo feels like a shell — capable only of taking from Jesse’s warmth and affection without being able to return enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe Jesse would be better off with someone fully whole, someone who can give him the relationship he deserves. The thought leaves an icy hollowness in Yugo’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But he ignores it, lost in the aching fog of his own inadequacy.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo double-checks the straps on his backpack as they set off down the trail, the morning forest air crisp and fragrant with pine. Ahead, Taiga and Hokuto chat lightly, their joined hands swinging between them. Beside Yugo, Jesse walks in pensive silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Things have been stilted between them since Yugo overheard Jesse’s conversation at the grocery store last week. He knows Jesse is trying to act normal for the sake of their friends, but the lingering awkwardness sits like a stone in Yugo’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the trail begins to climb more steeply into the mountains, Yugo focuses on pointing out footing tips and places to pause for water. Slipping back into guide mode comes naturally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make sure to test your weight on any handholds before committing,” he calls back to the group. “And lean into the slope when ascending to keep centered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse gives him a small but grateful smile when they stop to sip electrolytes. Yugo’s chest squeezes. He wishes he could shake off the hurt and doubt still clouding his mind. But at least out here, he can try to ensure Jesse’s comfort and safety. That much is within his power.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The view opens up as they crest a ridge, the valley floor spread out verdantly below. Hokuto gasps, pausing to snap photos of Taiga framed against the vista. Yugo hangs back, not wanting to intrude on their moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse steps up beside him. “It’s so beautiful up here,” he says quietly. “Thank you again for inviting me along.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Yugo swallows down the automatic apology on his tongue. “Just wait till we reach the falls — it’s the best part coming up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s answering smile, small but real, loosens the knot in Yugo’s chest ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a food and rest break, they set off for the last push to the waterfall. The trail narrows as it winds deeper into the canyon, at times barely shoulder-width across the sheer rock face. Taiga goes first, picking his way nimbly across the exposed sections. Hokuto follows, Taiga coaching him past the most precipitous points.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo gestures for Jesse to go ahead of him. “I’ll be right behind you in case you need any handholds,” he says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse takes a breath and steps onto the ledge. Yugo spots him around the tightest switchback, heart catching when Jesse’s foot slips momentarily on loose gravel. But he catches himself and recovers, making it around the bend to Taiga’s encouragement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it’s Yugo's turn, alone on the ledge with the canyon falling away beneath his feet. The familiar thrill of exposure washes away everything else. He traces the handholds Taiga used, reaching back carefully with his left foot to find each notch in the rock face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly, the sandy grit beneath his fingers gives way. Yugo’s stomach lurches as he loses his grip. His foot slips off the ledge, calf scraping painfully against the stone. He glimpses Taiga’s panicked face receding above as he plummets into open air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The world spins and goes black.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rhythmic thunder of helicopter blades cuts through the haze of pain surrounding Yugo. He feels himself being lifted, the stretcher swaying under him as he's carried up into the belly of the aircraft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It strikes him as darkly ironic — he just fell over a hundred feet down the canyon wall, and now they’re taking him up even higher to be airlifted out. The altitude shift makes his battered body ache and spin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the too-bright emergency room, Taiga appears above him, eyes wide with worry. He tries to take Yugo’s hands, but they’re a ruined mess of cuts and abrasions like the rest of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re prepping an OR for you now,” Taiga says, voice tense but calm. “Jesse and Hokuto are in the waiting room. Everyone’s been so worried, but we're all here for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo tries to nod, to offer some reassurance, but even that slight motion sends his skull pounding. Nurses descend and begin cutting away his dirtied, bloodstained clothes. He catches disconnected phrases over the snip of scissors and rush of water — spinal fracture, emergency surgery, lucky to be alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How lucky can he be, with his body broken and organs bruised? The lights overhead blur into a single bright smear. Somewhere in the rapid activity, they insert an IV line, and blessed darkness claims him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Yugo next wakes, he finds Jesse sitting anxiously at his bedside. Relief breaks across his face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yugo, you’re awake,” he breathes, taking Yugo’s bandaged hand gently. “How are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo blinks slowly, mind sluggish. “You don’t … have to be here,” he forces out through cracked lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse frowns. “What are you talking about? Of course I want to be here with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I mean …” Yugo swallows thickly. “You’re off the hook now. Don’t have to … take care of a broken mess … like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Understanding dawns, quickly followed by anguish. “Yugo, no. You listen — I’m here because I care about you, so much. I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s eyelids grow heavy again. He murmurs, “Just call me … when I’m better … back to normal …”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse starts to reply, but Yugo slips back under, the painkillers dragging him down once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next few days, Yugo drifts in and out of lucidity. When awake, embarrassment floods him at the thought of Jesse seeing him so weak and dependent. Surely this pitiable version of himself must have destroyed any lingering attraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But every time his eyes open, Jesse is there — keeping vigil, mopping his brow, feeding him ice chips. Yugo wants to send him away, to spare him further hardship. But he lacks even the strength to form the words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, late one night after the nurses have finished their rounds, Yugo wakes to find Jesse asleep in the visitor’s chair, head tipped at what must be an incredibly uncomfortable angle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo watches his chest rise and fall steadily. He thinks about everything Jesse has done — waiting anxiously, caring for Yugo’s feeble body, ignoring every hint that he should leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A lump forms in Yugo’s throat. However little he may deserve it, this man has shown him unwavering devotion. And he knows with sudden clarity that when he’s well again, Jesse will still be there waiting, no phone call required.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gratitude and wonder swell in Yugo’s chest, easing some of the shame and bitterness that have clouded his recovery. He still has a long healing journey ahead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But maybe, just maybe, he’s not as broken as he thought.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo stares blankly at the TV, barely processing the inane daytime talk show. It’s been five days since he was discharged home from the hospital, body wrapped in a rigid brace from neck to hips. Just sitting up for twenty minutes leaves him drained and breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The doctors said he’d need to wear the brace for eight to twelve weeks, and then they could discuss recuperation therapy. But every tiny movement hurts, his limited mobility a cruel mockery of the vital man he was just weeks ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Part of Yugo wishes Jesse would stop visiting so he wouldn’t witness this pitiable shell he’s become. He fights to act chipper, to look like the confident, magnetic guy Jesse first fell for under the cherry blossoms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But between the braces and bandages covering his battered body, the illusion doesn’t hold for long. Yugo can only keep the act up briefly before exhaustion claims him again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He figures eventually Jesse will leave like he’s hinted and not come back. One day he’ll slip away after Yugo falls asleep mid-conversation, unwilling to watch someone he cares for reduced to this feeble state any longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo wouldn’t blame him. He could barely stand to look at his own reflection these days. Why would vibrant, handsome Jesse want to keep seeing him like this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>So Yugo steels himself each evening when Jesse arrives after work. He laughs too loudly at bad jokes on TV, forces his protesting body out of bed to shuffle small laps around the apartment. Anything to appear strong, to delay the inevitable departure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But no matter how Yugo tries to speed him on his way, Jesse remains. He’ll work quietly on his laptop while Yugo naps fitfully. And when Yugo wakes up, Jesse is still there — making dinner in the kitchen, chatting with Taiga and Hokuto around the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Watching Jesse chop vegetables or hand him medicine calmly, no trace of pity in his eyes, fills Yugo with turmoil. He doesn’t understand why Jesse persists in caring for someone so clearly not worth the effort anymore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One night, as Jesse is leaving, Yugo finally voices the question haunting him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you keep coming back? You don’t have to stay just because you feel obligated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse pauses, meeting his gaze solemnly. “I’m here because I choose to be. Not from obligation, but because you’re important to me. I’m not leaving you to handle this alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He grips Yugo’s hand, warm and solid. “I wish you could see yourself the way I still do. This doesn’t change anything about how much I care.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s throat tightens, words failing him.</span>
</p><p>
<span> Jesse kisses his forehead and leaves with a gentle squeeze of his fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And despite everything, watching him go fills Yugo with an ember of hope.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo glances around his apartment, ensuring everything is in place for Jesse’s birthday dinner tonight. It’s been a month since the canyon fall that left his body broken. But his mobility has improved enough recently to host this small celebration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Yugo suggested taking a rain check due to his condition, Jesse insisted on having it here so Yugo could participate comfortably. Just one of many thoughtful gestures that have come to mean so much these past weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A knock at the door announces Taiga and Hokuto’s arrival. Soon the table is loaded with takeout dishes and a fine cake from Jesse’s favorite bakery. Now they’re just waiting on the guest of honor himself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right on time, another knock sounds. Yugo’s pulse speeds up irrationally as he lets Jesse in. No matter how often they see each other, that swooping sensation in Yugo’s stomach never fades.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Happy birthday!” Taiga and Hokuto chorus, raising their glasses. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse grins, eyes crinkling. The candlelight softens his features, reflecting warmly off his skin. He’s effortlessly handsome, dressed in a casual button-down and jeans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they serve the food, Jesse insists on fixing a plate he can bring to Yugo, still confined to the couch by his back brace. “Can’t have the guest of honor waiting on me tonight,” he teases. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo accepts the thoughtfulness gratefully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dinner passes enjoyably, filled with lighthearted stories and banter that put Yugo at ease. For a few hours, he can forget about doctor appointments and therapy. Here, surrounded by the people he cares for most, he feels almost whole again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the dishes are cleared, Taiga fetches the cake while Hokuto helps Yugo with his gift. It’s nothing fancy, just a new gardening book and some imported flower seeds, but Yugo hopes Jesse will appreciate it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse admires the presents sincerely, pulling Yugo into a gentle hug. “Thank you, these are wonderful. Although having you all here is gift enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga rolls his eyes good-naturedly. “All right, enough sappiness, time for cake!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As he dishes out slices, Yugo clears his throat awkwardly. “Would you two mind giving Jesse and me a few minutes alone first?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s eyes widen knowingly, but he ushers a bemused Hokuto down the hall without objection. Yugo is once again grateful for his tactful understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alone with Jesse, Yugo takes a steadying breath. “So, I wanted to say thank you for tonight, and for everything these past weeks. It really means a lot that you’re still here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse covers Yugo’s hand with his own. “Of course. I meant what I said at the hospital — I’m staying by your side through all of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes are earnest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s chest tightens, but he forces himself to continue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At first, I thought I could use the accident as an excuse to keep you at a distance. I’d finally fallen, quite literally.” He huffs a wry laugh. “I thought once you saw me like this, fragile and broken, you’d lose interest and I could avoid getting invested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse starts to interrupt, but Yugo squeezes his hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, let me get this out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse subsides, nodding for him to continue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told myself it was for the best if you moved on. But being around you these past weeks, I couldn’t keep pretending. You make me forget all of this.” Yugo gestures at his brace. “I feel whole with you, unbroken. And I can’t ignore what that means anymore.” He meets Jesse’s gaze directly. “I wanted to fall, and I already have. For you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse’s eyes shine. He cradles Yugo’s face gently in his hands. “I’ve fallen for you too. Of course I have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lips meet softly at first, then more urgently. Jesse’s hands slide into Yugo’s hair, deepening the kiss until they’re both breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally break apart, Jesse rests his forehead against Yugo’s. “Thank you for telling me that. It’s the greatest gift I could have asked for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo just smiles, letting himself be held. The future is uncertain, but right now he’s exactly where he wants to be.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo takes a deep breath, reveling in the feeling of sun-warmed air filling his lungs completely unhindered. After three long months, the restrictive braces finally came off this morning. He’s still sore and building strength back up, but today is for celebrating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse squeezes his hand, smiling brightly. “How does it feel to be brace-free?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely incredible.” Yugo grins back. “I’d almost forgotten what it was like to move and breathe normally. No more clanking when I walk!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They share a laugh, drawing Hokuto and Taiga’s attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The four of them are spending the day at the park for an informal braces removal party, per Jesse’s suggestion. Somewhere Yugo can enjoy being outdoors again without overexertion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s our man of the hour!” Taiga calls out. “Come have a seat and let me grab us some food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo settles carefully onto the picnic blanket, Jesse's steadying hand at his back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto passes out drinks. “I’m so happy for you, Yugo,” he says warmly. “Those past few months were not easy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo ducks his head, touched. “Having all of you by my side helped more than you know.” He slips his arm around Jesse’s waist. “Especially you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse presses a kiss to his temple. “I’ll always be right here.” The simple devotion in his voice makes Yugo’s chest swell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got the goods!” Taiga announces, returning with containers of food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they eat, chatter drifts over Yugo, his friends’ presences cocooning him in contentment. He never could have imagined going through such a devastating injury and coming out the other side with deeper relationships. But here they are, stronger for having weathered the storms together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, as the sun sinks towards the treeline, painting the sky in brilliant hues, Yugo finds a moment alone with Jesse. They stroll hand-in-hand along the water’s edge, ducks paddling by.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for sticking with me through the hard parts these past months,” Yugo says. “I know it couldn’t have been easy dating someone broken.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse stops and turns to face him. “You were never broken to me. Challenged sometimes, yes, but never broken.” His eyes shine with sincerity. “We all have our battles. What matters is having support through them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yugo’s throat tightens. He pulls Jesse close. “However did I get so lucky as to have you come into my life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jesse smiles against his hair. “I ask myself the same thing every day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stay tangled in each other’s arms as the sun sinks below the trees. Yugo knows fears and doubts won’t disappear overnight — a lifetime of caution can’t be undone so swiftly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But with Jesse’s patient love to anchor him, he feels bold enough now to confront those challenges as they come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fortune favors the bold, he reminds himself. And though it was difficult at times, taking that leap together was the greatest risk that ever paid off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With courage and compassion as their guides, any future feels possible.</span>
