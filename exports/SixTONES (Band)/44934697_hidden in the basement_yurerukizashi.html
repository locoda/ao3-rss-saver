    <h2 class="toc-heading">hidden in the basement</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Yugo and Jesse had been drinking the night they ordered a sex chair. They weren’t close to wasted, but it’s enough for them to think of a sex chair as an investment, like mutual funds.</p><p>It was already past midnight, and Nao is tucked in her bedroom, fast asleep. Yugo and Jesse were at the kitchen table, recovering from their daughter’s seventh birthday party. They had thought they had kept it simple this year, because last year they went all out with a princess party and balloons and a three-tiered cake and Taiga deciding to sing every Disney princess song imaginable.</p><p>This year, Nao’s seventh birthday party was at an art studio party where Nao and her friends splattered paint on the newspapers and other kids more than on their canvases. Realizing that, in fact, children can be messy, Yugo spent a good half hour coordinating with the owner of the studio if they have bathrooms and enough supplies to get the kids cleaned up before going home.</p><p>Back home was the best part of their day. Their kid was asleep, and they poured beer on frosted mugs. Some jazz song is on the stereo, and pizza was defrosting in their oven. They sat across each other on the counter, raised their glasses, and smiled. Jesse is wearing his bright pink pajamas that make him look like an overstretched condom, and Yugo falls in love either way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>First, some background.</p><p>They say that a married couple’s sex life diminishes after they have their first child. Yugo and Jesse are just one of the many couples who can attest to that.</p><p>Don’t get him wrong — Yugo <em>loves</em> being a parent. He had known that he wanted kids when he and Jesse started talking about a future together. When Nao came into their lives, it was a dream come true.</p><p>But child-rearing and work replaced intimate moments that they love spending with each other. By the time they finished feeding and putting Nao to sleep, they’re exhausted. They would flop into their bed and fall asleep any chance they get.</p><p>And it was a lie when they’ll have more time when Nao grows up. Jesse had given up an office job to work remotely so someone could be around for Nao, while Yugo accepted a promotion at his current job. Sometimes his job involves working long hours that by the time he’s home, he’s too exhausted to even think about sex with his husband.</p><p>Plus, with a kid around, there’s little opportunity to have sex. Having sex at night meant sneaking, latching the bedroom door, keeping the bed squeaks low, and listening for footsteps, jiggled doorknobs, and small covert breathing. Nao could come bursting in and everyone knows the sight of their parents having sex would <em>traumatize</em> a child. Having sex on a weekend meant shipping off Nao to one of their friends, and the last time they tried that, they felt the exhaustion from world and child-rearing catching up to them. And when everything is on their favor, they have to resort to hurried hand or blowjobs on the bed and in the shower.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So, the sex chair.</p><p>Jesse found it as a joke. They were talking about their lack of sex for the past few months and about the times when they were younger and single and more adventurous. Which led them to a sex toys website and eventually to the furniture section.</p><p>The chair is earth-toned and could blend in well as a couch. The description for it promises “stability for effortless transitions,” “increased mobility” thanks to its ergonomic design. But what caught their eye is the promise to “cradle all the right places and recharge sexual energy.”</p><p>Yugo and Jesse have been married for seven years. They still had sexual energy, but they do miss the excitement in their lives. Maybe they do need to recharge.</p><p>But the best part is …</p><p>“It’s 30% off,” Jesse announces as he scrolls down the page.</p><p>Yugo digs out his credit card usually reserved for groceries and emergencies and adds the chair to their cart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The chair arrives six days later in a huge box, plain and unmarked. Jesse — who’s almost always home — greets the unsuspecting delivery man and carries the box inside. He takes a picture of it after unpacking and sends it to Yugo, who at least had the common sense to excuse himself for a 15-minute break to head to the empty pantry to video call Jesse and to see what their purchase looked like.</p><p>“Looks legit,” Jesse tells him with a thumbs up.</p><p>“Where are we gonna put it?” he asks, realizing only know that they haven’t exactly discussed how this would work. With its navy-blue color, it could match the living room and the bedroom. But they have a seven-year-old daughter, so the living room is definitely a no. And they don’t have enough space in their bedroom.</p><p>“The basement?” Jesse suggests.</p><p>Their basement is technically Jesse’s mancave. It’s a wide open space, the walls painted creamy beige to make it feel like they’re in a café. And most of all, the space is private, a whole two floors down their bedroom. But of course, they still have to be careful.</p><p>And honestly? The planning is the exciting part.</p><p>“When do you wanna do it?” Jesse asks, his voice so low that Yugo’s blood rushes in the right places.</p><p>Yugo clears his throat and looks around the company cafeteria for any sign of eavesdropping co-workers. “Tonight,” he whispers, remembering that Nao had complained about some activity in PE and she probably would be too exhausted to wake up in the middle of the night. “And wear something nice.”</p><p>Jesse smirks. “Gotcha.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo speeds out of the office as soon as the clock strikes 5 pm. His boss had backhandedly mentioned some backlogs, but honestly, Yugo doesn’t care. His entire body is thrumming with excitement as he drives home.</p><p>The wait is longer when they have dinner. It’s obvious that the two of them are agitated, but more excited, on what is going to happen tonight. Nao, bless her, seems oblivious with what her fathers are going through, instead content to babble on about her favorite television show and complain about being tired.</p><p>But it’s all worth it. After Yugo tucks Nao to bed and descends to the basement, he’s greeted with a soothing scent coming from the candles lighting up the already dim room. From the corner, he sees Jesse slowly approaching him, wearing only a bathrobe <em>and nothing else</em>. He makes sure to lock the door before meeting Jesse halfway.</p><p>“Hey,” Jesse says, as if they haven’t seen each other in years.</p><p>“Hey.” Yugo grins, and suddenly he’s in Jesse’s space and tilting his head up, pillowing their lips together. Jesse chokes out a sound of surprise before almost immediately melting in his mouth.</p><p><em>He tastes like strawberries</em>, Yugo realizes as he nibbles at Jesse’s lip, teeth just barely grazing him before he’s pushing at them with the tip of his tongue. Jesse takes his tongue willingly, letting it slide over his teeth. He thought they would be passionate and hurried, but Yugo takes his time as Jesse lets him explore the depths of his mouth, with Jesse making the most obscene noises he has ever heard.</p><p>Jesse wastes no time before he walks backward, dragging Yugo along with him, until he’s lying on the sex chair, and Yugo on top of him. Yugo leans in over top of Jesse, <em>towering</em> over him, hands resting on the sides of the couch. “<em>God</em>,” Yugo says. “You have no idea how long I’ve waited for this.”</p><p>He watches Jesse gulp. He’s making himself small on purpose, letting Yugo look <em>bigger</em>, more in control. “Do whatever you want with me, Yugo,” Jesse sighs.</p><p>Yugo’s breath hitches. Yugo pulls once more at him, and Yugo lets his husband guide him onto his laps, Yugo’s legs trapped on either side of Jesse’s. The comfort levels of the chair would take some getting used to, but Yugo doesn’t want to wait anymore. Jesse pouts at him, and almost instantly, Yugo’s lips are on his and devouring him.</p><p>He rocks up on his knees, grabbing either side of Jesse’s face with his hands as his hardening cock ruts into his husband’s stomach. Yugo growls into the kiss and feels Jesse shiver in delight before he releases his face to run his hands down Yugo’s sides. He closes his mouth around Jesse’s bottom lip and sucks, making the skin red and swollen in what feels like seconds. Jesse’s hands sneak around Yugo’s waist and pulls him closer, rocking their crotches against each other.</p><p>Yugo breaks the kiss to throw his head back, moaning deeply and pressing their cocks together more insistently. “Go rougher,” Jesse breathes against the front of his throat.</p><p>Jesse presses his lips to the column of Yugo’s throat, trailing wet kisses and licking around to his pulse, underneath his ear, even the juncture of his shoulder. He fumbles around with Yugo’s sweats to reach inside, helping tug the sweats down enough to free him, then just as hastily pulls his cock out. Jesse pulls Yugo back so they’re chest to chest and encourages another roll of Yugo’s hips. “Come on, Yugo,” he encourages. “Grind against my cock.”</p><p>Yugo lets out a low <em>“Fuck</em>” just before he takes a long, languid roll of his hips into Jesse’s, bumping his cock against his and grinding it into Jesse’s lap. “I’m not gonna last long,” he warns.</p><p>Jesse laughs just as he presses his lips into Yugo’s jaw. “That’s really hot. That you’re so desperate. So desperate to fuck your cock against mine.”</p><p>His knees feel weak, not only with Jesse’s words but with the repetitive movements. His thighs burn with exertion, and he drops on top of Jesse with a huff, then gathers up both their cocks in his hand to jerk them off together.</p><p><em>“Oh,”</em> Jesse moans, letting his head fall back against the couch. Yugo gasps a few times, flicking his thumb over their combined tips and spreading precum down them until they’re both a little more wet. The glide is easier and more satisfying, especially with how much he himself is dripping over them. He feels like he’s been pent up like this for months of no unrestrained sex, and he <em>needs this</em>. He needs it <em>so bad</em>, and the thought of it makes him shake.</p><p>“I’m gonna come,” Yugo pants out.</p><p>Jesse whines and spasms under him at the statement. He raises a hand to cup over their tips, swirling around them to help Yugo.</p><p>Yugo’s jaw drops as he comes over both of them, squeezing tighter and tighter, returning to jerking roughly with tensed muscles. He plants his forehead against Jesse’s as he comes until he’s done. He lets go of himself with a deep groan and gathers the strength to kiss Jesse. He lets go of his own softening cock to take Jesse completely in his hand, fisting him to an unknown rhythm. “Come on, come for me,” he growls. “Come on my cock.”</p><p>Jesse’s back arches in the couch, hips raising and bucking into Yugo’s fist. “Yes, <em>yes</em>—” he whimpers. “<em>Fuck</em>—Just … <em>like that</em>.” His words are slurring and jumbling together until Jesse can hardly understand him.</p><p>The gasp Jesse lets out when he comes sounds borderline painful. Yugo strokes him through and noses his way back to Jesse’s lips for deeper kiss. Jesse shudders against him, even his moans sounding shaky against Yugo’s lips. Eventually, he slows down and relaxes. Yugo releases him and lets his hand rest against Jesse’s waist.</p><p>“You’re fucking insane,” Jesse mutters after a few minutes. </p><p>“We’re <em>both</em> fucking insane,” Yugo reasons back. </p><p>Jesse opens his eyes, his head rolling from one side to the other to catch Yugo’s eyes were he hovers. The fucked out look on Jesse’s face and the sweat beading at his forehead never fails to make Yugo feel crazy, just like the first time they had sex together. “This sex chair is the best purchase we ever had.”</p><p>Yugo laughs and shakes his head. “You know …” He hovers back down and kisses Jesse again. “I saw that manual that came with the chair. It shows us other crazy positions we can do on it.”</p><p>Jesse laughs and chases his lips again. “It <em>is</em> Saturday tomorrow.”</p><p>“Nao’s gonna be sleeping in.”</p><p>Jesse hums, his hands on Yugo’s hips. “What if we ask Shin to take her off our hands for a couple of hours?” he suggests. “You know, to try those positions.”</p><p>It’s a good thing Nao loves her Uncle Shin. “Sounds like a <em>great</em> idea.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo doesn’t know how long he has been asleep, but he’s awoken by a huge weight plopping on their bed and a girl’s voice asking about breakfast. Jesse, always full of energy even after god knows how many rounds of sex, takes over, tickling Nao and helping her get up so they could make breakfast.</p><p>God, Yugo loves his husband because right now, he just wants to lie in bed all day.</p><p>He <em>does</em> get up when he hears his stomach rumble. Downstairs, Jesse is already setting up the table. Yugo kisses his husband good morning, and another one for thanks.</p><p>“Already asked Shin,” Jesse says when he pulls away. “And Nao’s excited to visit her uncle.”</p><p>“Good.” Yugo grins, excited for their activities together. He looks over his shoulder. “Where’s Nao?”</p><p>“Dad! Papa!” Their daughter’s voice echoes from the basement. “Since when did we have a cool new couch?”</p><p>They look at each other, eyes wide in horror.</p>
