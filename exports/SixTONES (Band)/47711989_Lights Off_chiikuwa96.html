  <em> It’s okay… It’s okay… Everything is gonna be okay…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Sssshh," Hokuto took a deep breath, feeling his emotion deep through his lungs. He relaxed his chaotic mind, and told himself that everything is going to be okay. </p><p> </p><p>His surroundings are messed up. He could feel rage and disappointment, but he knew it was all just his fantasy. His hands are shaking uncontrollably. But it only got worse as he grabbed his hands tighter. His grip left marks. His blood was clogged, pierced by his nails. It took an hour before his hands returned to normal. If he had held on to them for longer, his palm would have been torn.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto-san, are you ready?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes,"</p><p> </p><p>With a thousand degrees of anxiety and uncertainty in his tone, Hokuto nodded. Pulling himself together to kick some asses in his rough world. </p><p> </p><p>"Wilder! Yes! That gaze! Put some wind on him. Legs wider! Fabulous!" </p><p> </p><p>A lot of cameras and lights spot Jesse in the middle of the site. The man took some cool poses, laughed tenderly, and spread his blazer, following the wind, as he was instructed. </p><p> </p><p>With long legs and an outstanding appearance, Jesse made himself his own spotlight. Not to mention his good character, his capability to get into one’s heart makes everyone expect his presence. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, guys! It’s a wrap! Thanks for today!"</p><p> </p><p>As his photo session was done, Jesse went straight to his car. He was chased by the time, site to site to do recordings and stuff. </p><p> </p><p>"Jesse-san, there’ll be a runaway show next week. Hokuto-san and Juri-san will come as well," the manager said. He let Jesse know his next schedule in the very near future. </p><p> </p><p>"Juri?"</p><p> </p><p>"You, as the model, Hokuto-san will be the invitation, and Juri-san will be the performer for the afterparty."</p><p> </p><p>"Me? The Model?" Jesse’s eyes widened. Finally, he wasn’t just a talent, but also considered enough as a model. </p><p> </p><p>"Also, do you know Curtain Call Co.? A big publisher that only stars huge stars? He contacted the agency, and the executive was willing to meet you," the big cheese still came to him. Jesse could imagine that it was probably one of the best days of his life. "…they said there’s something that can only be done by you,"</p><p> </p><p>"When will it be held?"</p><p> </p><p>"He wants to meet you within three days," the manager added. "....If you care enough about meeting them, I can put it on your schedule,"</p><p> </p><p>"Of course I will. Do I have a reason to decline it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Actually, yes—,"</p><p> </p><p>Day by day, the bustle is increasingly felt. Meetings to meetings, filmings, social parties. Like 24 hours is not enough, showbiz never sleeps. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto, Jesse, and Juri are the new-born stars that are expected to be showbiz’s future hope. They all came from three different fields. Hokuto is an actor; Jesse is a model who also made his way into reality shows; and Juri is a musician with unique characteristics and gaps that made him known in various genres of shows. Hokuto and Juri knew each other since they went to the same school. Jesse and Juri became close as they met a lot on variety shows. Both chemistries fit each other, which made them used to come as a team. And Hokuto and Jesse spent their time together as trainees at the same agency for years. Their duality made them seen as the perfect definition of Yin and Yang. Their closeness is out of the ordinary, but they are second to none since both of them are currently top-notch. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto! Right here!" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto walked faster as he heard someone calling him. From where he was standing, he could see Jesse and Juri leaning on a small circular table with whiskeys in front of them. </p><p> </p><p>"You killed it, man!" Hokuto bro-hugged Juri and Jesse. "I recorded your performance and Jesse’s runaway. I’ll send you later, ‘kay?"</p><p> </p><p>"We’re nothing more than you, dude. I saw your film the other day. An action movie? That was really batshit!"</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks, man," Hokuto smiled shyly. </p><p> </p><p>"A shot for tonight?" Juri offered Hokuto a whiskey. </p><p> </p><p>"I think I’d just have a soda for tonight," Hokuto declined. </p><p> </p><p>"Don’t be such a chicken! Why did you even come to an after-party for a soda?" </p><p> </p><p>"Do I have any requirements to have one?" Hokuto rolled his eyes. "Besides, I have an early filming in the first morning,"</p><p> </p><p>That’s what should have happened. It is supposed to be that way. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto called a waiter to give him a soda. But it’s not because he has to stay sober. He had another reason why he won't take alcohol. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay? You look pale," Juri said, looking at Hokuto closer. </p><p> </p><p>"Su,-sure," Hokuto answered anxiously, looking for a safe space to run away from Juri’s gaze. </p><p> </p><p>"When is the release?" Jesse asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Probably next year," Hokuto answered lightly, taking his delivered soda and gargling it inside his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"It’s not mouthwash! HAHAHA," Jesse and his unique laughter caught attention. </p><p> </p><p>Announcements are released everywhere, making the assumption that everyone wishes they were now on top. In the end, those things that seem to shine are ephemeral. Even for stars, when the lights are turned off, they return to being normal humans. A hard life comes their way. </p><p> </p><p>"What the fuck are you doing?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri’s eyes wide opened as he caught Hokuto in the men’s room, standing in front of the mirror, holding a needle with his gum bleeding. </p><p> </p><p>"Where did you get that from?" Juri took the needle and threw it away with a speed light. He cupped Hokuto roughly and checked the bigger guy’s mouth in worry. "What the actual fuck are you thinking, man? It’s all a slash wound!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto grew silent as Juri examined how bad his reckless action was. He thought nobody would realize what he had done. It’s just a needle. Everybody could just think he’s cleaning his tartar. Above and beyond, he realized that wounds in the gums healed so quickly and were barely seen, and the sick idea came up when he was cleaning his teeth.  </p><p> </p><p>"Is this why you refuse to take alcohol and take soda instead? Does it hurt? Of course it hurts," Juri surrendered roughly. "For fuck sake you’ll infect your mouth if you pour them with sugar!" </p><p> </p><p>"I’m sorry,"</p><p> </p><p>"You better!!" Juri barked. "We’re going home now!"</p><p> </p><p>"But the party is still up….."</p><p> </p><p>"Do I look like I’m giving a fuck right now?" Juri glared. He took Hokuto’s soda and asked the man to wash his mouth with water. He went back to the circular table to drop the glass and excused himself to Jesse. "Hey, man! I gotta go now. Hokuto wasn’t feeling okay,"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! Is he alright?"</p><p> </p><p>"I’ll get the guy home," Juri refused. He doesn’t want to make it a big deal. Moreover, Jesse has no clue that Hokuto has this bad habit. </p><p> </p><p>"I’ll come with you,"</p><p> </p><p>"No, you enjoy your party! I’m good. He’s okay,"</p><p> </p><p>"If you need anything, you know where to find me, okay?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sure! I’ll be in touch with you," Juri excused himself in haste. He called Hokuto’s manager and asked him to take them to Hokuto’s apartment. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's mental state has always been a concern. The guy learned his bitter pill the most, so he has the tendency to do everything in a perfect way and is eager to improve. On the other hand, he takes criticism, slights, and regrets personally.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was a perfect student who barely wasted his time socializing but aimed to get to the top. It was always like that. The admiration he got when he looked at showbiz was a big turning point in his life. All that always goes smoothly as he wishes is all vice versa. As he sank himself into the entertainment industry, he had to live with uncertainty, like it or not. </p><p> </p><p>Coupled with his past as a role model student, many people saw him in disbelief. He was known as an awkward loner nerd, but now he’s stepping himself into a dazzling world that not everybody could touch. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You? An actor? Did you lose your mind? You don’t even pretend to get some friends. How can you be an actor? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, he believed what people said about him. He thought he wasn’t that worthy. He didn’t fit in this world. Hokuto’s journey is full of rough patches. He has no VIP ticket to get to the top. Thanks to the crazy ambition he has, his success-driven ambition counterbalances his self-doubt, so he thinks it would be better to keep moving than stop and worry about little things that would go bigger automatically in his head. </p><p> </p><p>As someone who knew him many moons ago, Juri tends to ask Hokuto to take his time, but the man always declines it. Juri, who always lives in uncertainty, was less stressed than Hokuto. He was so good at handling things that unexpectedly happened. He knew his character with Hokuto was upside down. He could see how Hokuto is so sensitive to stress, but he couldn’t do anything to make the guy chill. Hence, there’s something to throw the dice on when it comes to him. </p><p> </p><p>"Is there something that bothered you again?" </p><p> </p><p>All the dark times and bad memories seem to issue some trauma. Fighting all by himself and thinking there’s no ally around him caused Hokuto to have this extreme quirk. It all began when he was in a tight corner, where he claimed that he probably could barely hang up any longer. He scratched his head in frustration, and the pain caused him to relieve himself. When he couldn’t memorize all the lines he got, he would slap himself roughly. When he was nervous, he would scratch his hands. And when he's holding his rage, especially to himself, he’ll grip any part of his body and scotch it with his nails. </p><p> </p><p>A little wound won’t affect nothing. But he is still sane enough that a stand-out wound would attract people’s attention, and his body is an asset to his job. </p><p> </p><p>However, he needs to let his emotions out. </p><p> </p><p>"I’m fucked up. I can’t do this anymore," Hokuto started to bite his nails, but Juri took his hands down. </p><p> </p><p>"That’s not true. You just put everything that was supposed to be in order, to advance," Juri claimed. "Let’s take a deep breath for a while. Let’s jot down everything you have right now, and let’s see what we can do for priority first," </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto is never satisfied with himself. Along with the ambition that finally took him to the spotlight, his self-doubt was reversely getting deeper along with the ridiculous idealism he had of himself. Hokuto can never be at ease. Every little thing that got in his mind always led him to countless sleepless nights, thinking about how he could keep going in this world without being useless and to be expected. All the gaze he had from his past ghosted him. Along with that, he loses himself, and without warning, his body takes control of him. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes being with Hokuto felt so heavy for Juri. But he couldn’t let the man go by himself. They have always been together since high school. Both knew their own slackness, and both had each other’s backs to support them. Even though Hokuto is not Juri’s responsibility, Juri feels responsible for him as he was always by his side. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Boom… Boom… Boom…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Juri! Why did you come late?"</p><p> </p><p>"Work, man! I’m a star! Remember?" He joked. </p><p> </p><p>Ear-deafening electro music echoed throughout the entire hall. People scream and shout, enjoy the party vibes of the club, dance, and get drunk. </p><p> </p><p>Juri walked to the bar, ordering the strongest one to let his stress off of what he saw a couple of hours ago. It turns out that being a good man is exhausting. What he needs right now is a fun night that can lift his nuisance. </p><p> </p><p>"Juri…"</p><p> </p><p>The voice of a young lady calls him seductively. Despite the loud music they got there, Juri could feel the arousing whisper he got as the girl touched him, leaning on his back and calling his name gently. </p><p> </p><p>Juri turned around, and the girl pecked him. </p><p> </p><p>"You smelled like alcohol," the girl giggled. She wrapped Juri with her hands and sat on his lap. </p><p> </p><p>"We agreed to not do this anymore," Juri sighed. </p><p> </p><p>"But you seem to not hate it," teased the girl.</p><p> </p><p>"I’m not," Juri scoffed, and sank his head between her breasts. "You smelled good," </p><p> </p><p>"Why do we have to stop meeting each other?"</p><p> </p><p>"Because you're just my sex friend,"</p><p> </p><p>"Then why did you ask me to come? You could’ve just ghosted me, or blocked me,"</p><p> </p><p>"Because you know what I need," Juri said, cupping the girl and giving her a deep kiss. One reckless action caused him to do something in the same way. </p><p> </p><p>Juri just wants to forget a rough day he had. He never got why Hokuto tends to cripple himself. Hokuto might be sober enough, but he can’t even control his state of mind. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> If that's the case, why don’t you just lift it up by getting drunk anyway?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"The VIP room is vacant. Why don’t we go there?" the girl lured. "Just the two of us,"</p><p> </p><p>✧༺♥༻∞</p><p>✧༺♥༻∞</p><p> </p><p>"Is everything okay?" Jesse asked. He pulled up a chair and faced himself in the mirror, fixing his hair while waiting for the staff to call them to the set. "How’s Hokuto doing?"</p><p> </p><p>"He’s good. He’s just overworked," Juri sighed. He stared at Jesse for a moment, feeling the relief he got every time he got his time to be just the two of them. <em> It’s not like I hated him, but it would be nice if Hokuto could be this calming…  </em></p><p> </p><p>"Why’d you keep staring at me? Anything on my face?" Jesse asked. </p><p> </p><p>"Nothing," Juri grinned. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse is Juri’s oasis. The man had the most stable state of mind of them all. He never complained about anything, and it’s always fun to be with him. Jesse is the life of the party. And Jesse’s life is a party. He wondered if the man had ever touched the ground, feeling in-depth and lost in the dark. Because everything he saw the first time he met, was always his smile. </p><p> </p><p>"Jesse, have you ever felt so angry that you just want to burst?" Juri questioned Jesse’s emotions out of the blue. As uncertainty and extreme quirks are already part of his daily intake, Jesse seems to live in a different world. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I had. I’m a human after all," Jesse chuckled. "But putting so much anger out doesn’t bring any solution. So….,"</p><p> </p><p>Juri nodded, feeling so proud that Jesse could still be in that state of mind, keeping his head clear and serene within this uncertainty. </p><p><br/>
But what he doesn't know is, the happy face Jesse got is just how he behaves towards the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>✧༺♥༻∞ Lights Off / To Be Continued</p>
