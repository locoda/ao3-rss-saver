      <p>Yugo asked Juri if they could hangout together since it'd been a while since their schedule matched and decided to meet in a coffee shop to catch up on each other.</p><p>As they meet up and have a conversation, Juri asked Yugo about his love life and he said: "I just want to date for now and don't want to commit in a serious relationship at the moment, but I've been chatting to other people just to pass time."</p><p>"How many are you flirting with?"</p><p>"Around three, but Jesse seems to catch my interest since he is a good person, have a beautiful voice and the way we have conversation about anything." Yugo smiles as he describes Jesse to Juri.</p><p>"Why don't you go for it? Seems like Jesse is the person you're looking for."</p><p>"He's almost perfect and I'm not. You know me, I get intimidated when it comes to those types."</p><p>"Don't let your fear ruin it for you, what if he's the one you're searching after all these years." Juri was pushing Yugo to give Jesse a chance.</p><p>"How about going on a vacation? We can also invite Shin, so you can both meet Jesse."</p><p>"That would be nice since it's been a while since we last traveled." As the conversation continued, they didn't notice the time until one of the staff asked them if they would have a last order since they are closing. Both said no and the staff left.</p><p>"Wait, before we leave, I'll call Jesse." Yugo called Jesse and introduced him to his best friend. Yugo told him their vacation plan and Jesse agreed to join them. As Yugo ended the call, Juri could see the bright smile on his face.</p><p>"I'll chat you the details once I've settled everything, it is nice to see you Juri."</p><p>"Same here, Yugo." when he saw Yugo driving off, Juri just got into his car and dropped off the facade, starting crying because he loves Yugo but he kept pushing his best friend away in order not to ruin their friendship while knowing that Yugo will never look at him more than just a friend.</p><p>"Why do I keep breaking myself just to see you happy? How many times do I need to cry for you, Yugo?"</p>
