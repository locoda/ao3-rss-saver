<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Beginning to get an idea of it?" Jesse asked, flashing that another dazzling smile of his.</p><p>Taiga swore that guy must know precisely what that smile was doing to him.</p><p>Taiga had thought that seeing a heart written next to his name on Jesse's customer note folder a few weeks ago would have given him confidence in approaching his personal trainer more boldly. But it frankly had made all the opposite happen because Taiga was now reading too much into every situation. Since Taiga was an overthinker to begin with, he had mentally started scolding himself for reading too much into every situation spent with Jesse. Then Taiga always started scolding himself for scolding himself about that over-reading... and well, the loop was on.</p><p>The whole situation felt like a set from a cringe-worthy rom-com, where Taiga couldn't decide if he was the awkward protagonist trying too hard or the oblivious side character not trying enough at all. Every other hour, Taiga was also convinced Jesse was flirting shamelessly back, and every other hour, he was convinced Jesse was just being friendly and treating him like any other client.</p><p>Seeing Jesse's questioning look, Taiga realized he'd once again zoned out and Jesse was expecting him to say at least something.</p><p>His brain usually wasn't functioning fast when it came to Jesse, but at that moment, Taiga actually got an idea.</p><p>Summoning every ounce of courage he could muster, he took a deep breath.</p><p>"Actually," Taiga started. "Could you show me that last move once more?"</p><p>He flashed a shy innocent smile, though it might have looked more like someone trying to hold in a sneeze. Honestly, Taiga's attempts at flirting would probably have been more believable if he were a 15-year-old girl, given that most of the tactics he was trying seemed straight out of a teen romance playbook.</p><p>But Jesse nodded, though he looked a bit perplexed, as if he couldn't decide whether to burst into laughter or not.</p><p>"Sure thing," he then said, stepping closer to demonstrate the overhead press. "Just watch my form and follow along."</p><p>Taiga watched intensively as Jesse performed the exercise with effortless precision. Taiga did his best not to stare at his thighs and calves too much. If he had gone there, he could have sworn that maybe Jesse wanted him to stare at those parts of him, considering he had chosen shorts that were exposing his muscles just a bit too perfectly.</p><p>Taiga was so screwed—but not in the way he wanted, unfortunately.</p><p>Then Taiga grabbed his weights, which were 5 kgs less than Jesse's (because let's face it, even if he was willing to take an emotional hit, he wasn't about to risk injuring himself for real in front of his crush), and tried to mimic Jesse's movements as poorly as he could.</p><p><i>Oh shit</i>, Taiga thought, <i>so I'm really stooping this low? Already started with the "help, I'm so bad at this and need your help" kind of show?</i></p><p>Once again, it might have been more believable if Taiga were either a better actor or a high school girl in love who had watched too many dramas to genuinely believe such tricks would work on hot personal trainers with short pants and amazing muscles.</p><p>Especially if those muscles came with the most mesmerizing brown eyes on the planet, Taiga's mind started wandering again.</p><p>And as if those muscles and eyes weren't enough, Jesse had gone and grown a beard and mustache over the past few weeks, looking even more handsome and irresistible than before. If Taiga hadn't already been harboring desires to jump on Jesse since day one, he was now teetering on the edge of ripping off his own clothes in the middle of the gym and announcing him to take him right there.</p><p>He glanced over at Jesse, who was trying valiantly to keep a straight face. Jesse either guessed that Taiga was acting, or he was genuinely surprised at how much Taiga sucked. Either way, it wasn't a good thing – revealing Taiga's terrible acting skills or denting Jesse's professional skills as a trainer. Taiga needed to put more into it so that Jesse would guess his hidden agenda.</p><p>"Maybe you could show me once again which muscle I'm supposed to feel it in?" Taiga suggested boldly.</p><p>"Absolutely," Jesse replied in a friendly casual manner.</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but wonder if Jesse was secretly enjoying this hilarious flirting circus going on or if he genuinely was that oblivious to Taiga's attempts.</p><p>Nevertheless, the trick seemed to have worked in the way Taiga wanted it to.</p><p>Jesse brought his fingers delicately to trail along the thin skin of Taiga's inner arm. "This is where you should feel it," he elucidated, directing Taiga's focus to the area nestled just below his elbow.</p><p>At that moment, Taiga's mind went blank, and he couldn't help but concentrate on anything else than how arousing that felt.</p><p>"But umm, what's up?" Jesse went on, sounding a bit confused yet teasing at the same time. "Didn't we go over the basics of this movement weeks ago?" He quickly added, "Not that it's a problem, of course. I don't mind at all! I'm here to help, no matter how long it takes for things to click. In fact, I wouldn't mind having you as my client forever."</p><p><i>There it is again</i>, Taiga thought. <i>That's definitely flirting! This is processing, we can't stop here now.</i></p><p>"Is there still something unclear?" Jesse inquired.</p><p>"Maybe," Taiga replied lowly.</p><p>Jesse's lips curved into a small smile. "Should I show you that muscle again?"</p><p>"If you could, please."</p><p>As Taiga lifted the weights again, Jesse moved closer once more, lightly brushing his fingertips along Taiga's inner arm.</p><p>Taiga attempted to shoot a flirtatious glance at Jesse's way, hoping to signal his desire for Jesse to keep touching him. However, with the weights in his hands above him and feeling the seductive touch, Taiga basically only grimaced and <i>flinched</i>. That made Jesse quickly retract his hand—a reaction Taiga definitely hadn't intended. Poor Jesse probably thought Taiga was about to drop the heavy weights on their feet.</p><p>"Umm, I think you've got it," Jesse said, looking a bit flustered but then visibly relieved as Taiga safely brought the weights down and landed them on the floor.</p><p>"Yeah, I've got it. Thanks for your help," Taiga said.</p><p>"No, you should thank yourself, you're a quick learner!" Jesse hurried to compliment him.</p><p>Their training session continued, punctuated by another set of nice smiles, long gazes, and the occasional flirtatious remarks and brushing touches coming from both sides. Taiga himself made sure to "casually" drop hints about his single status into the conversation, hoping Jesse would pick up on them.</p><p>At one point, Jesse's personal trainer friend Morimoto passed by, shooting them a very very suspicious glance that was maybe sending some "I see what you're up to!" vibes. Taiga couldn't help but feel like he was caught red-handed in the middle of a covert operation, except it was just harmless flirting at the gym. Hopefully, Taiga thought, Morimoto could keep his nose out of their business and focus on his own clients' squats and lunges.</p><p>As Jesse seemed receptive to the flirting but hesitant to take the next step, Taiga quickly brainstormed a new plan next to the back lounge machine. He recalled seeing Jesse arrive and leave by walking through the parking lot several times, so it was clear he had a car.</p><p>"It's so hard today, going home," Taiga complained, trying his best to sound annoyed.</p><p>"Oh, what's wrong?" Jesse asked worriedly.</p><p>"I've got a load of stuff to carry, and to top it off, my train line's all messed up because of renovations. Looks like I'll be taking the scenic route home." Taiga tried to emphasize his made-up dilemma.</p><p>Jesse sent him a sympathetic look. "That sounds rough."</p><p>"Yeah, it'd be so nice if someone could drive me home," Taiga sighed, hoping Jesse would take the bait.</p><p>"Well, hopefully something turns up!" Jesse said cheerfully before suggesting they should return to their back extensions.</p><p>As they resumed their exercises, Taiga couldn't help but wonder if Jesse was more inclined to play knight in shining armor for damsels in distress rather than dudes with transport troubles.
Still, he clung to the hope that there was something was going on between them. Whether it was genuine interest or just wishful thinking, one thing was certain: he had spotted a heart next to his name on Jesse's folder.</p><p>Once again, Taiga had difficulties concentrating on physical performance because he kept only thinking about possible options and various scenarios involving one particular bearded man. At least he could ignore the physical strain in his muscles when his mind was that full.</p><p>After the third round of back extensions, Jesse told Taiga to take a small break. He motioned them to sit down on the floor mats.</p><p>Once again, Jesse had a smile on his face, a little bit mysterious and naughty, that would have been hard for anyone to resist.</p><p>"So Taiga, what do you like doing in your free time?"</p><p>"Nothing too interesting," Taiga replied honestly, pondering which of his hobbies would sound appropriate to someone as sporty and health-conscious as a personal trainer, and would also give the impression he wasn't always out with a new date. "Well, I grow tomatoes at home on my balcony. I sing a lot. At home, not at karaoke! And, umm, I sometimes go out and play Pokémon GO. I suppose you could say I don't socialize much."</p><p>"I see! So, you're not the type to be invited for a beer or anything like that after training?" Jesse chuckled.</p><p>"Yeah, definitely not. Always heading straight home and happy to keep it that way!"</p><p>Jesse flashed another smile, but there was a sudden shift in his expression. "Alright, good to know."</p><p>For the rest of the training session, Taiga was determined to keep the flirting going. However, he couldn't shake the feeling that Jesse seemed a bit more reserved all of a sudden, despite still responding to Taiga's small glances and smiles. Taiga couldn't understand the sudden change in Jesse's demeanor.</p><p>By the end of their training, Taiga had to confess his defeat for the day and throw in the towel, quite literally. They had maybe processed somewhere, but still not enough.</p><p>They simply bid polite goodbyes to each other. At least there would be a new chance again next week, but maybe he should give up completely at some point, Taiga thought to himself. Or come up with something more radical that he had been thinking for a while as an option.</p><p>*****</p><p>Taiga had already changed and was ready to leave the gym, but then no one but Jesse caught up with him in the corridor.</p><p>"Taiga, sorry to keep you, I know you're eager to head home, but do you have a minute?" he asked.</p><p>"Sure," Taiga replied, and Jesse led them to an empty room that seemed to be reserved for massages. Jesse closed the door behind them and locked it.</p><p>Jesse looked Taiga straight in the eye as he turned to speak to him.</p><p>"I thought it'd be good to discuss something with you."</p><p>Taiga nodded. "Great idea because I have something to tell you first."</p><p>He turned to face Jesse with exaggerated seriousness. Taiga cleared his throat.</p><p>"Jesse, I know you said that you wouldn't mind having me as your client forever. Too bad I'm here to inform you that I hereby declare the termination of our professional relationship. Consider yourself fired as my personal trainer!"</p><p>With a dramatic wink, Taiga added, "There. Now you can kiss me, right?"</p><p>Jesse's jaw practically hit the floor before he dissolved into loud laughter. "You're kidding, right?"</p><p>Taiga fought to maintain a serious expression. "No, I'm dead serious!" he said, "I've been trying to make a move on you for ages, but I finally figured our trainer-client dynamic was holding you back."</p><p>"Oh, so you're interested in me?" Jesse teased with a smirk.</p><p>Taiga studied him for a moment. Then he nodded slowly, unable to contain his smile back at that smiley face. He was so easy when it came to Jesse, but Taiga had already admitted weeks ago that he was weak for the guy.</p><p>Jesse's grin widened at Taiga's nod. "Well, that's very convenient then. Because I'm interested in you too. I've been looking at you since day one."</p><p>Despite the confession, Jesse maintained his usual composition, with no signs of embarrassment whatsoever. He only kept looking at Taiga gently. Where did he get that self-confidence? Taiga could only wonder.</p><p>"Just a few clarifications," Jesse added. I don't have a car, and I don't even have a driving license. I mostly come to work with Shintaro, Morimoto Shintaro, who can drive. Otherwise, I'd have suggested you come in the same car with us, but I don't want that guy as a third wheel!"</p><p>Good thinking.</p><p>"Second," Jesse continued. "I was about to ask you for a beer after our training but it didn't sound like you're interested in that kind of stuff--"</p><p>"I am," Taiga hurried to cut him. "I do drink, and I like that!"</p><p>Jesse shot Taiga a teasing smirk. "So, am I supposed to scold you for not following my nutritional advice?"</p><p>Taiga wagged a finger. "Don't forget that you're fired now!"</p><p>"Am I?" Jesse's tone was playful as he took a step closer to Taiga. "You don't want to see me again?"'</p><p>Taiga raised an eyebrow. "Depends."</p><p>"On what?"</p><p>"On what's going to happen next."</p><p>Jesse's gaze lingered on Taiga's lips as he took a step closer. His hand found its way to Taiga's neck, his thumb tracing small circles at the junction of Taiga's neck and shoulder, where the exposed skin lay.</p><p>"How about I show you what happens next, even if you won't fire me?" Jesse whispered, leaning in.</p><p>Taiga felt his pulse quicken. Without hesitance, he also leaned in and met Jesse halfway, their lips clashing into a fervent kiss. Taiga's fingers tangled in Jesse's hair, pulling him closer as the kiss deepened.</p><p>It felt insanely good. Jesse's beard teased against his lips, adding a rugged feel to the kiss. Despite Jesse's confident conduct, he wasn't dominant. Taiga took the lead, playfully nibbling on Jesse's lower lip, feeling Jesse's smile against his mouth as he hummed in response and parted his lips wider.</p><p>Jesse's hand came to cup Taiga's face as he deepened the kiss, tentatively pushing his tongue into Taiga's mouth and leaving Taiga dizzy.</p><p>As they parted, Taiga caught his breath, panting against Jesse's lips.</p><p>"I... think I'm going to keep you around for a little while longer after all."</p><p>"That's the answer I was hoping for," Jesse replied, flashing a smile before pulling Taiga into another kiss.</p><p>Jesse's hands didn't stay only on Taiga's face and shoulders, but Taiga felt his strong hands run down and up on his bare arms. When Jesse's hands found their way to Taiga's ass, Taiga couldn't help but roll his hips against Jesse's, creating friction. That elicited gasps from both of them.</p><p>With that, Jesse pushed Taiga against the wall, the roughness of the gesture making Taiga think that he could almost come right then and there.</p><p>But when Jesse dropped to his knees and pulled Taiga's pants down and underwear along, Taiga didn't have the slightest coherent thoughts left. All he could focus on was Jesse's eager expression, like a kid in a candy store, except the candy was Taiga's junk.</p><p>Jesse wasted no time in bringing his mouth to Taiga's hard dick. He took a tentative lick of his precome and lapped at what had smeared around the whole head. Then he kissed along the length, mouth opened wide, tongue frolicking. Finally, he wrapped his lips around the tip, applying gentle suction.</p><p>Taiga's hands found their way to Jesse's head, trying his best to restrain himself from thrusting his hips, though the effort proved difficult. But who could blame him, really. Jesse was giving one hell of a performance down there. Taiga let out a moan that was probably unflattering, but at least that way, he could keep his hips still.</p><p>Then Jesse took his cock full into his mouth and brought his own hands on top of Taiga's, gesturing him to start moving, and Taiga couldn't hold it up any longer now that he had permission. He started thrusting vigorously, fucking into Jesse's mouth. He fastened up the rhythm with every thrust, not caring that he definitely couldn't hold up long with that.</p><p>Despite expecting a quick release due to weeks of pent-up desire, Taiga was surprised by how fast he reached the climax. With a shuddering breath accompanied by a low groan, Taiga released himself into Jesse's mouth, his final thrusts becoming languid as his spill came out in slow steady streams.</p><p>As Jesse stood up, Taiga could only manage a weak grin as his knees felt kind of shaky—shakier than they ever had during any of their training sessions.</p><p>"So, you do make house calls, I hope?"</p><p>Jesse chuckled, brushing a hand over Taiga's cheek before planting a soft kiss on it.</p><p>"Those ones too, and free of charge for you," he replied. "But I think we need to discuss that in a bit more detail."</p><p>As Taiga pulled his pants up, he quickly recalled that Jesse probably needed some relief as well, at least judging by the way he had been moaning into their kiss and his hardness pressing against Taiga's own crotch. He wrapped his arms around Jesse's shoulders now that he was sure he was more than allowed to do so and was very ready to return the favor.</p><p>Taiga's hand slid down Jesse's well-toned back until they met his firm ass, giving it a playful squeeze. Jesse actually <i>moaned</i> at that. Then Jesse leaned in closer, his voice low and sexy as he spoke, "If we want to continue, I think I need to go and grab some supplies first. You know, being well-prepared is always important for the training."</p><p>"Oh, absolutely," Taiga responded eagerly, nodding as if he were agreeing to a crucial business deal.</p><p>"We mustn't forget the essentials, like massage oil, protein shakes, and... uh, extra towels!" Jesse added with a wink.</p><p>Looked like one blowjob and some wild romp in the gym weren't going to put an end to their flirting.</p><p>"I'll be right back," Jesse assured him, planting one more quick peck on his lips before stepping out of the room and leaving Taiga alone.</p><p>As Taiga grinned to himself about his success in hitting on his personal trainer and receiving a real blowjob from him, he also started thinking about how he couldn't wait to tell Chaka about it. Chaka had previously dismissed Taiga's crush as silly and hopeless, but now Taiga had a juicy plot twist to prove him wrong.</p><p>However, his reverie was abruptly interrupted when the door opened again.</p><p>"Did you forget something? Me perhaps?" Taiga asked with a flirtatious grin, only to freeze as he realized the newcomer from the door wasn't Jesse but his personal trainer friend, Morimoto.</p><p>Both of their faces dropped like a pair of cartoon characters would do.</p><p>"This isn't a waiting room," Morimoto deadpanned automatically before he probably realized properly who Taiga was. "Wait, are you Jesse's client? Why are you here?"</p><p>Taiga tried to concoct a plausible excuse, but before he could stammer out a response, Morimoto swooped in with another question.</p><p>"Are you waiting for him? Is Jesse going to give you some kind of special massage service?"</p><p>"Uh, yeah, exactly! Massage service!" Taiga said, nodding.</p><p>"Well anyway, in that case, you should wait outside. That's breaking the rules. I'm just taking... this one," Morimoto said, reaching for a massage ball on the shelf.</p><p>Taiga nodded hurriedly and quickly made his way out of the room at the same time with Morimoto, hoping to avoid the discussion going further and him scolding him more. Morimoto still didn't look less suspicious as Taiga sheepishly stayed behind the door.</p><p>Taiga mentally added "avoid Morimoto at all costs", "always lock the door" and "Jesse likes his ass getting touched" to his gym survival guide from then on.</p>
