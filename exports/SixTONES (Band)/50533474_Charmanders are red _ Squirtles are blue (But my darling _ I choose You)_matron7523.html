<p>"Kyomoto!" Hokuto calls out as he enters the room. "I've got something for you as well!"</p><p>Taiga looks up from his phone, where he's been engrossed in watching probably anime and removes his earphones. "Oh, really? What is it?"</p><p>Hokuto pulls out a Pokémon plush toy from the bag and holds it up for Taiga to see. "Ta-daaaa! I bought it for you from Nagoya's Pokémon Center."</p><p>Taiga blinks at the stuffed toy for a moment before his expression turns into one of confusion. He slowly reaches out to take it from Hokuto's hand and examines it closely. "This is... Rattata," he deadpans.</p><p>"Yes?" Hokuto blinks in return.</p><p>Taiga's lips twitch with amusement as he looks up at Hokuto. "Oh, nothing. It's just that Rattata is... well, forget about it. Thanks, Hokuto."</p><p>He casually tosses the plush toy aside, wearing a bemused expression, before diving back into his phone.</p><p>Hokuto is left in contemplation, pondering what on earth just went wrong with that and why Taiga doesn't appear to fully appreciate his heartfelt gesture. It's not as if this is their first souvenir exchange. In fact, the last time Taiga visited Hawaii with his parents, he ended up bringing Hokuto a bottle of hot sauce, explaining the choice by saying he knows how much Hokuto enjoys cooking. However, to this day, Hokuto has never confessed to Taiga that the hot sauce is so spicy that it has remained untouched in his cupboard after the first and only attempt to use it in a meal. But Hokuto is well aware of Taiga's fondness for Pokémon, so he believes this episode should be entirely different from the hot sauce incident.</p><p>Hokuto is grateful for having a friend like Shintaro, who, sometimes unwittingly, comes to the rescue in situations like this.</p><p>During their lunch break, with only the two of them present, Hokuto regales Shintaro with a tale from his recent trip for a drama shoot. He recounts how he was fortunate enough to have some spare time to hunt for souvenirs for all the members and their staff. Hokuto casually mentions how some of his co-stars excitedly convinced him to visit a Pokémon Center with them during their time in Nagoya. But what truly grabs Shintaro's attention is when Hokuto reveals that he purchased a Pokémon plush toy specifically as a souvenir for Taiga during that visit.</p><p>The way Shintaro leans over the table is almost comical as he is immediately interested in hearing what kind of a stuffed toy Hokuto managed to buy so exclusive that Taiga wouldn't already own one.</p><p>Hokuto, with a somewhat sheepish face, scratches his head. "Well, umm... it was some sort of a purple mouse? Why?"</p><p>Shintaro bursts into laughter so bad that he nearly snorts out his drink.</p><p>"Rattata?!" Shintaro exclaims, his laughter so intense that he struggles to catch his breath between peals of amusement. Finally managing to get the words out, he continues with an explanation. "That Pokémon is probably one of the lamest and most useless ones ever! It's like the synonym for the word 'forgettable' in the dictionary. I can't even imagine what Kyomo's reaction was when you gave it to him. Please, you have to tell me!"</p><p>"I don't know, he didn't really say anything?" Hokuto answers, now feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p>"I have a hard time believing that. That guy is so Pokémon-obsessed that he won't just accept any random Pokémon plushie. It's got to be a legendary one or... well, Kyomo probably just throws it into the trash!"</p><p>"Are there really such big differences between Pokémon?" Hokuto asks. "Don't they all just look cute and have different elements or something?"</p><p>Shintaro, still chuckling, manages to compose himself enough to explain, "Oh, don't say that when Kyomo is around. If no one else, he's the one who takes Pokémon very seriously and would start a lecture on how each Pokémon has its own lore, abilities and strengths. Rattata, well, it's just not very impressive. But hey, it's the thought that counts, right?"</p><p>Hokuto nods and mumbles, "I guess so," suddenly very strongly questioning his choice of gift.</p><p>When Shintaro and Hokuto return to the recording session to check in on the other members, they can't help but notice the infamous Rattata plushie sitting in a place of honor next to Taiga's bag. Shintaro sends an amused glance in Hokuto's direction now that he knows the embarrassing story behind it, and Hokuto silently regrets his life choices by saying anything to that fellow.</p><p>As if reading their thoughts, Kochi spots the toy and points at it. "Hey, Taiga, that plushie is so cute! Did you buy it recently? Don't you already own enough Pokémon stuff?"</p><p>"Oh, but I didn't have Rattata before, can you imagine," Taiga answers. "It's my favorite Pokémon after all." He says the last sentence so loudly that no one in the room can really miss that. And in that split second, Hokuto can't help but suspect that Taiga might have slyly shot him a quick meaningful look.</p><p>"Wait a minute, I thought Bulbasaur was your all-time favorite Pokémon! You've been saying that forever," Juri chimes in surprisedly.</p><p>"Yeah, Kyomo," Shintaro joins. "I remember you going on and on about Bulbasaur being the best Pokémon ever since you were fourteen. Have you switched allegiances on him?"</p><p>Taiga simply shrugs, the corners of his lips slightly curling upwards.</p><p>Kochi, with a grin, adds his two cents. "Maybe Taiga just has an ever-expanding list of favorite Pokémon and keeps them in rotation?"</p><p>"Well, let's not forget, Pokémon are like friends - there's always room for more!" Jesse announces, and then the whole topic quickly veers into different directions, as is often the case when the six of them are together. The conversation keeps going on until it's Jesse's turn to be called into the recording booth, which brings a hush to their lively chatter.</p><p>Later, as they wait for their turn, Hokuto and Taiga sit on a couch next to each other. Shintaro is in the recording booth while Kochi, Juri and Jesse have ventured out for lunch. The recording producer, looking focused on his equipment with headphones on, keeps his back turned to Hokuto and Taiga.</p><p>Taiga subtly shifts closer to Hokuto, their thighs touching.</p><p>Hokuto, though seemingly absorbed in watching Shintaro in the recording booth, can't help but feel a nervous flutter in his chest. His heart may skip a small beat as he turns his head ever so slightly to meet Taiga's eyes, finding luckily nothing but warmth and understanding in his gaze.</p><p>"I think I didn't thank you for the gift properly yet," Taiga says softly. "So, thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome," Hokuto answers. He looks a bit sheepish as he continues, "But, you know, I do realize now that Rattata is... well, kinda lame. And weird. I'm sorry about that."</p><p>"No, it's my favorite one," Taiga says. "And anyway, it evolves into Raticate, and that's the coolest thing ever."</p><p>"I-- what?"</p><p>Taiga meets Hokuto's face with an innocent look. "What?" he asks back. "It is cool! So, stop dissing Rattata."</p><p>"But you've always liked--"</p><p>"Oh, shush," Taiga interrupts him gently. "What do you know about that?"</p><p>Hokuto hums, and they get their concentration back to following recording in front of them.</p><p>Then, Taiga extends his hand so that his fingers brush the back of Hokuto's hand. Hokuto can't help his lips twitching upwards as he feels Taiga's fingers lingering and tracing gentle patterns on his skin. Then, as if in response, Hokuto slowly shifts his hand, opening it and finding Taiga's waiting palm. With a reassuring squeeze, Hokuto holds onto Taiga's warm hand, their fingers interlaced.</p><p>They stay like that for a long time. It's only when Shintaro finishes his recording and returns to join them that they reluctantly let go, their hands parting.</p><p>When they have finally wrapped up the day, and Taiga bids them all goodbye, he carefully takes the Rattata plushie and cradles it under his arm.</p><p>Shintaro sends a meaningful look into Hokuto's direction.</p><p>"Looks like I was wrong," Shintaro chuckles, nudging Hokuto's arm playfully. "It seems that even the 'lamest' Pokémon can find a special spot in Kyomo's heart."</p>
