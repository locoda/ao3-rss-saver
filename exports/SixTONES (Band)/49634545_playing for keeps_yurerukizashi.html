<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🩷</p><p>The first signs of autumn whisper gently outside Taiga’s window, the leaves adopting a fiery hue, painting the city in a palette of warm colors. But inside Taiga’s room, everything remains in the crisp shade of white, with a contrasting deep navy-blue headboard on his queen-sized bed. His blackout curtains shut out the morning light, giving the room a soft, muted glow.</p><p>The alarm clock on the bedside table blinks to 6:00 am, and with a reluctant groan, Taiga sits up. His glasses, sitting atop a small pile of books, are the first thing he reaches for.</p><p>He throws the blankets off and walks over to his wardrobe. The clothes hanging there are as predictable as the sunrise: blacks, whites, grays — an understated collection.</p><p><em>It’s not about being fashionable,</em> Taiga muses. <em>It’s about blending in</em>.</p><p>He recalls Shintaro’s playful jibes about his monochrome choices. “Ever thought of introducing a splash of color, Taiga?”</p><p>But why would he? Taiga’s work speaks volumes, not his wardrobe. Plus, there’s the whole thing about his “pretty face” drawing more attention than he’s comfortable with.</p><p>Selecting a white dress shirt and a charcoal gray tailored suit, he dresses quickly.</p><p>His mind shifts to breakfast, and he decides on a pre-made egg sandwich. <em>Efficiency</em>. He smiles to himself as he places it in the microwave.</p><p>But as the machine hums, a sudden thought strikes him. The date on the calendar flashes brightly in his mind.</p><p>One year. It’s been exactly a year since he and Jesse broke up. That unmistakable pain surges again, the very one he’s been trying to suppress.</p><p>
<em>Why did everything go so wrong? Was it that vacation where I wanted some alone time, and he took it personally? Or the time I forgot his birthday because of a case?</em>
</p><p>Memories flood in, and he can vividly remember Jesse’s face, the hurt in his eyes, the misunderstandings that piled over time. The comforting hum of the microwave becomes a distant sound as he dives deeper into his thoughts.</p><p>Suddenly, the piercing beep of the microwave brings him back to the present. He blinks, realizing he’s been lost in thought, and checks the clock. Panic sets in.</p><p>
<em>I’m late!</em>
</p><p>In his rush, Taiga grabs the sandwich, now hotter than he’d like, almost burning his fingers. He barely tastes it as he wolfs it down, still haunted by the bittersweet memories of his past with Jesse.</p><p>With a last glance at his reflection, ensuring every hair strand is in place and his attire impeccable, he reminds himself that he’s supposed to have moved on by now.</p><p><em>Today’s a new day,</em> he reminds himself, stepping out of his apartment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The mediation is a beacon of tranquility in the city’s bustling heart. Its calm exterior invites passersby to explore the sanctuary within. The moment Taiga steps inside, the comforting ambiance envelops him like a familiar hug. The nature-inspired décor reminds him of why he chose this profession — a constant journey of navigating people through their turbulent waters to find harmony.</p><p>Taiga’s workspace is a personal haven, radiating a sense of serenity. As he settles down, he can’t help but feel at peace. The soft potted plants on his desk sway gently, greeting him. He brushes his fingers over the photos on the corkboard — cherished memories of happier times, some featuring Jesse.</p><p>Arranging his notepad and colored pens, he takes a moment to breathe deeply, inhaling the calming scent that fills the room. The gentle instrumental music playing in the background only adds to his grounded state.</p><p>But just as Taiga begins to settle into his morning ritual, the door creaks open, revealing a grinning Shintaro. “Morning, Mr. Monochrome,” he teases.</p><p>“Hey, Shin,” Taiga replies with a wry smile. “Planning to distract me from work again?”</p><p>Shintaro chuckles, plopping down on Taiga’s cozy chair. “Just checking in. Big day today?”</p><p>Taiga scans his schedule. “A couple of challenging sessions lined up. You?”</p><p>“Same.” Shintaro shrugs. “But I know you’ll ace them.”</p><p>Their playful banter continues for a few more minutes, setting the tone for a productive day. After all, having his best friend as his co-worker always uplifts Taiga’s spirits.</p><p>Soon, it’s time for Taiga’s first mediation session. Gently ushering the involved parties into the room, Taiga emphasizes the principles of the process.</p><p>“Remember, this is a safe space. It’s all about understanding and collaboration,” he assures them.</p><p>The divorcing couple sits across the table. Their faces reflect a complex mix of sorrow, anger, and hope. Starting these sessions is never easy, but Taiga’s goal always guides him — understanding, empathizing, and aiming to resolve.</p><p>As they begin to speak, the weight of their pain fills the room. Words of regret, blame, and unmet expectations flow. At one point, the wife’s statement mirrors an argument Taiga had with Jesse.</p><p>
<em>“Why didn’t you understand, Jesse? Why did every little thing have to become a battle?”</em>
</p><p>The recollection of Jesse’s hurt eyes, the strain in their voices, and their inability to bridge the emotional gap washes over him. But just as swiftly as the memory engulfs him, Taiga pulls himself back, drawing on his professional training to remain anchored.</p><p>He listens, responds, and guides, doing his utmost to ensure the session remains on track. The words exchanged in the room may not belong to his personal narrative, but they serve as a reminder of his own unresolved past. Yet, today is not about him. It’s about helping others navigate their own stories.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The aroma of freshly baked bread and sizzling garlic wafts through the air as Taiga and Shintaro step into the chic restaurant, were soft jazz adds a warm ambiance. They’re quickly seated at a cozy corner table, framed by ambient candlelight and sleek, modern décor. A sense of ease settles between the two friends, a quiet camaraderie they’ve shared since high school.</p><p>Shintaro, always the talkative one, excitedly discusses a new mediation technique he learned. Taiga listens intently, nodding occasionally. But as is typical of Taiga, his internal thoughts dominate. He wonders how Shintaro manages to stay so upbeat even after a draining day of settling conflicts between people.</p><p>Just as Shintaro is about to delve into another intriguing point, two familiar chimes sound in unison. They reach for their phones, scanning the new email’s content. The restaurant’s soft lighting reveals their contrasting expressions: Shintaro’s eyes brighten with excitement, while Taiga’s face masks an internal struggle.</p><p>“High school reunion?!” Shintaro exclaims. “Man, I can’t believe it’s been ten years.”</p><p>Taiga fidgets, recalling not-so-fond memories of high school. “I don’t know, Shin,” he says hesitantly. “I wasn’t exactly the life  of the party back then.”</p><p>Shintaro leans back, studying Taiga with a discerning eye. “I remember,” he says gently. “But there were also those who stood up for you. Don’t forget them.”</p><p><em>He’s right,</em> Taiga thinks, reflecting on those moments of solidarity. Then, he’s drawn back to the memories of the peer mediation club, and he can’t suppress a smile. “Remember when you practically kidnapped me into joining that club?”</p><p>Shintaro grins. “Guilty as charged. But look where it got you!” He gestures at their surroundings. “We’re doing the same thing in high school, but we’re getting paid! Really well, I might add.”</p><p>They both share a laugh.</p><p>Shintaro takes a deep breath. “I get it if you don’t want to go, Taiga. People change, but memories linger. But who knows? This reunion could be different.”</p><p><em>Can I truly face them after all this time? What would they think of me now? </em>Taiga wonders.</p><p>Looking back, Taiga doesn’t think his high school life wasn’t <em>that</em> terrible. He had always done his best to lie low and blend in, because his looks had caused him enough trouble when he was in grade school. He became friends with Shintaro, discovered that maybe helping classmates get along is his life passion, and got along with his classmates.</p><p>But, you know, some events tend to stick with you. One misunderstanding was enough for Taiga to retreat to his shell. Still, Taiga remembers the people who stood up for him. He wonders what they’re doing now …</p><p>The mood grows introspective for a few moments as the two dine. Shintaro respects Taiga’s space, giving him the time to think.</p><p>Finishing their meal, they get ready to leave. Taiga finally speaks up. “I think … I think I’ll go.”</p><p>Shintaro raises an eyebrow, a hint of surprise evident. “Really?”</p><p>Taiga nods. “Yeah. Just … Maybe I’ll just drop by for a couple of hours, read the room. And if things get uncomfortable, I could always leave, right?”</p><p>Shintaro grins. “Okay.” He reaches out to pat Taiga’s arm reassuringly. “Either way, I got your back.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The light slanting through the gap in Hokuto’s curtains signals the start of another day. The soft hues of the morning paint the neutral palette of his room, with the deep blue bedspread absorbing the golden light. He takes a moment, drawing a deep breath and appreciating the tranquility.</p><p>After a few minutes of meditation — a habit he’s recently tried to instill — he stretches, allowing the energy to course through him. His routine exercises are swift and efficient, as most things are in his life. He’s all about strategy and efficiency.</p><p>Walking into the kitchen, Hokuto whips up an antioxidant-rich smoothie. Mid-sip, his phone vibrates. Notifications. The social media world doesn’t wait.</p><p>His latest post, a slick display of the newest fashion line he’s collaborating with, is a hit. Comments flood in, fans praising the elegance and asking for tips. Hokuto taps back, answering with brevity but always ensuring a touch of warmth.</p><p>Work mode on, he drifts towards his workspace, the desk bathed in sunlight. Sketches of outfits, script notes for styling tips, plans for upcoming videos; the organized chaos is both a passion and a profession.</p><p>Yet, somewhere between jotting ideas and reading messages, a cloud covers Hokuto’s mental sun.</p><p>Two months.</p><p>It’s been two months since Juri packed his bags, his voice echoing accusations.</p><p>“You never make time!”</p><p>The pain feels raw, even now. But wasn’t Juri’s new job at the design studio also demanding? Maybe it was Hokuto’s workaholic habits, his tireless ambition, or maybe it was Juri’s own piling workload.</p><p>Either way, they drifted.</p><p><em>Maybe we both just focused too much on work</em>, he muses, running a hand through my hair.</p><p>The vibrant art on his digital frame shifts, perhaps mirroring his own flux of emotions. A silhouette of two figures, close but not touching.</p><p>Another buzz. A message from Alice.</p><p>“Lunch before our consultation? 🍜” it reads.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. Alice always had a way of grounding him, pulling him out of his spirals, whether knowingly or not. He quickly types back.</p><p>“Sounds good, usual spot?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A playful chime sounds as Hokuto steps into the restaurant, instantly hit with the comforting aroma of whatever is cooking in the kitchen. The bright lights are a refreshing departure from most places of its caliber. There’s no imposing grandeur, no starched tablecloths, just a warmth that reminds me of home.</p><p>He spots Alice, waving enthusiastically from a corner table. “Always early, huh?” he chuckles  as he slides into the seat across from her.</p><p>She beams. “Always! Besides, I’ve already ordered our usual.”</p><p>The memory washes over Hokuto of the countless times they’d celebrated our little victories right here. When they had registered the business, they decided to have dinner to celebrate, and this was the place that was closest to their budget. They could afford more luxurious restaurants, but this place will always have a sentimental value.</p><p>Their conversation swiftly turns to work, discussing collaborations and planning shoots. But a simultaneous chime from their phones interrupts them.</p><p>Hokuto squints at the screen — an invitation for their high school reunion two weeks from now. His stomach does a little flip. There’s excitement, sure, but also an undeniable dread. What if Juri is there?</p><p>He can see the gears turning in Alice’s mind, too. She leans forward. “You’re thinking about Juri, aren’t you?”</p><p>He sighs, swirling the drink in his glass. “Seeing him after … everything. I don’t know if I can.”</p><p>Alice nods, understanding in her eyes. “You know, I doubt you’ll even see him when we have so many people to remember. Remember Morimoto? He could light up a room with just one joke.”</p><p>Hokuto laughs. “Oh, I remember he’s friends with Kyomoto! Opposites in every way. I always wondered how they managed to stay friends.”</p><p>“They probably still are. Look, Juri was in a different section anyway. There are so many people to catch up with, Hokuto. Don’t let one person hold you back.”</p><p>Just then, their order arrives. It’s a deep-fried chicken wing gyoza stuffed with glutinous rice. Playful, familiar, yet uniquely upscale.</p><p>As Hokuto watches Alice burst into laughter, a flood of memories fills his mind.</p><p>It was in high school, amidst the chaos of assignments and hormonal teenage angst, that he met her. Alice Hirose. Her name, like her spirit, was enchanting and captivating. That vivacious girl, always with a camera hanging around her neck, introduced Hokuto to a world far from the traditional confines of Hokuto’s upbringing. The world of fashion, makeup, and the transformative power of artistry.</p><p>He remembers the way she would critique fashion magazines, her eyes scanning the pages with a mixture of admiration and contemplation. Her adventurous spirit was infectious, prompting Hokuto to experiment with outfits and delve into the world of cosmetics. Their classmates would often jest, teasing them about their unbreakable bond. Yet, despite the gossip and whispers of romance, our relationship was built on a foundation of friendship.</p><p>(Besides, Alice started dating a college boy when the teasing started, effectively shutting everyone up.)</p><p>Hokuto takes a deep breath, looking around the restaurant, then back at Alice. “About the reunion,” he begins. “Thanks. For reminding me there’s more than just Juri.”</p><p>Alice reaches over, squeezing his hand. “Hey, who knows? Maybe you’ll find a rebound among the classmates,” she teases, winking.</p><p>He laughs, feeling lighter than he has in weeks. “Only if you promise to be my wing woman.”</p><p>She raises her glass. “Always, Hokuto. Always.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The comforting hum of Hokuto’s laptop signals another task completed. He’s always loved the end-of-day quiet, the soft cocoon of my living room with its muted grays and pops of deep blues. He saves his work, stretches, and feels a smug satisfaction flood over me.</p><p><em>Another productive day in the books,</em> he thinks.</p><p>After closing the laptop, Hokuto strides across the room, passing by is desk, which stands near the window. The orange hue of sunset spills through the blinds, casting a soft, warm glow on the mix of classic and modern furniture. As he makes his way to the bathroom, his thoughts drift.</p><p>The warm water fills the tub, releasing steam that fogs up the bathroom mirror. As he lowers himself into the bath, the silky water engulfs him, relaxing tense muscles and soothing his mind. After a long soak, he pats his skin dry and applies his skincare regimen methodically.</p><p>Pulling on his silk pajamas, the texture feels like a gentle caress against his skin. With a sigh, he steps back into his living room, letting the ambient lighting set the mood. Soft music begins to flow from the speakers, its melody wrapping around him like a comforting blanket.</p><p>Hokuto’s gaze falls upon the half-finished jigsaw puzzle on the coffee table, Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”. It was a follower’s gift to him after he revealed in a Q&amp;A session that he likes solving jigsaw puzzles, particularly those with minimalist art. Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” is anything but minimalist, but Hokuto appreciates the gift anyway.</p><p>He smiles as he recalls how his love for puzzles began. It was his parents who introduced them to him, a way to engage the strategic thinking of their introverted son.</p><p><em>Ah, parents</em>.</p><p> The thought of them brings a pang of guilt. Ever since Hokuto decided to pivot from his expected path of educational psychology, their conversations have dwindled to a minimum. He can’t really blame them; their family has always been rooted in academia, and his choice seemed like a stark deviation.</p><p>
<em>I wonder if they’d be proud of where I am now?</em>
</p><p>As he places another piece into the puzzle, his mind drifts to the upcoming high school reunion. The potential run-in with Juri.</p><p>It’s been two months, but the gaping void he left still aches.</p><p>Three years. Three years of intertwined lives, shared dreams, and deep connection, now reduced to fleeting memories and lingering ‘what ifs’. The way he ended things, blaming Hokuto for not spending enough time together, still stings.</p><p>A mischievous idea flits through his mind.</p><p>
<em>Maybe, just maybe, I can make him regret his decision.</em>
</p><p>The reunion could be the perfect setting. Hokuto would turn up, have a great time. Make Juri see what he left behind.</p><p>And perhaps, if the opportunity presents, he might just indulge in a harmless flirt here and there.</p><p>Grinning at the thought, his fingers pick up speed. Before he knows it, the puzzle is complete.</p><p>Hokuto grabs his phone and without hesitation, tap ‘accept’ on the reunion invite.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sighs in relief as he wraps up another mediation session. The custody battle has been tense, with emotions running high between the couple as they fight over their children. As a mediator, it’s Taiga’s role to remain calm and guide them to a resolution, but some things leave him drained.</p><p>Stepping out of the meeting room, Taiga heads down the hall toward his workspace, ready to relax and recharge. Drawing closer, he furrows his brows as he notices his office door is ajar. Had he left it open?</p><p>Pushing the door open, Taiga is startled to see Shintaro perched on his desk, chatting animatedly with a familiar figure in a denim jacket. As the man’s face comes into view, Taiga freezes.</p><p>It’s Yugo, his old college roommate. Taiga hasn’t seen his free-spirited photographer friend in months since he’s always traveling for work. Yugo’s sudden presence in his workspace surprises Taiga, but it’s a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Shintaro looks up sheepishly as Taiga enters. “Sorry for hijacking your office, but I ran into Yugo downstairs and he wanted to surprise you,” he explains with an impish grin.</p><p>Yugo’s face lights up as he stands up to hug Taiga. “Hey, you! Long time no see.”</p><p>Taiga laughs, his tension dissolving instantly. “Yugo, you troublemaker. It’s good to see you.”</p><p>After shooing Shintaro back to work, Taiga grabs Yugo and heads to the coffee shop downstairs. Settling into the retro-style cafe with their steaming mugs, the two friends catch up.</p><p>“It was our first week in the dorm,” Taiga recalls, smiling, “when you said my tea preference sealed our friendship.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “Those were the days.”</p><p>“So, how’s the traveling photographer life?” Taiga asks, glancing at Yugo’s camera bag sitting on the table. He can see how it looks worse for wear.</p><p>“Oh, you know, living out of a suitcase and surviving on convenience store food,” Yugo jokes. He tells Taiga about his recent trip to Hiroshima for his travel magazine client.</p><p>Taiga studies Yugo for a moment. His friend appears older, perhaps wearier. Maybe traveling has taken a toll. Yugo seems to be fidgeting oddly with his mug. “Everything okay?” he asks.</p><p>“Hmm? Oh yeah, just caffeinated,” Yugo says dismissively.</p><p>Taiga doesn’t push it.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking of settling down,” Yugo says instead, his fidgeting settling down. “You know, stable job, fewer travels.”</p><p>Taiga breathes out of his nose. “Oh, wow. Kochi Yugo, globetrotter, thinking of settling down?” His eyes narrow. “Are you dating someone?”</p><p>Yugo chokes on his drink, coughing a bit. “I’m just … old. Okay?”</p><p>“Excuse me, you’re calling yourself <em>old</em> when we’re the same age?” Taiga retorts playfully.</p><p>The playful banter eventually fades, then Yugo asks, “What about you? How are things since … you know …” He trails off delicately.</p><p>Taiga’s smile fades. “You mean since Jesse left,” he states. When Yugo nods, he stares down into his tea. “It’s been a year, Yugo. But honestly? Most days I’m fine, but sometimes I miss what he had so much it hurts.”</p><p>Yugo shifts, and he looks upset.</p><p>Taiga glances up. “Hey, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, uh, I’m just sorry I wasn’t there for you when he left,” Yugo mumbles, avoiding Taiga’s gaze.</p><p>Taiga studies his friend curiously but doesn’t push. “Hey, it’s okay. You called me, didn’t you? I appreciated it.” He pats Yugo’s hand. “And I’d do the same for you, okay? I’m always a call away if you need an ear. That’s what friends are for.”</p><p>Yugo gives a small smile. “Yeah. Thanks, Taiga. I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The afternoon sun streams into Hokuto’s apartment, bathing the neutral-toned living room in a warm glow. He sits at his desk, scrolling through Instagram and sipping on a steaming matcha latte. The open floor plan allows him to keep an eye on his friend, Daigo, who is sprawled on the sofa, absentmindedly tapping away on his phone.</p><p>A pile of potential outfits for tomorrow’s high school reunion lays in an organized heap beside Hokuto. He had already meticulously planned an outfit for tonight’s corporate event; a crisp white button-down paired with a tailored blue tracksuit that will effortlessly showcase the new footwear line that the brand is endorsing later. However, choosing an outfit to impress his ex is proving to be more of a challenge.</p><p>“Hey Daigo, thoughts on this outfit?” Hokuto holds up a slim-fitting burgundy sweater and black jeans. “Does this scream ‘I’m single, fabulous, and you missed out?’”</p><p>Daigo glances up briefly before returning his attention to his phone screen. “How about going without clothes? Trust me, Juri’s simple. He’d say yes in a heartbeat if you showed up in your birthday suit.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Hokuto reaches for a shirt and tosses it at Daigo’s direction. “Real mature.”</p><p>Though they joke, Hokuto can sense an underlying distance. Ever since Hokuto started dating Juri and Daigo had moved out, things had shifted. Friendships took a backseat, especially with Daigo. While Alice seemed understanding, Hokuto feared he and Daigo were drifting apart, speaking only because they’re business partners.</p><p>Hokuto moves to his dedicated workspace, fingers brushing over the meticulous design of his bullet journal. It holds plans, memories, and most importantly, reminders of things not to forget. Like mending broken bridges.</p><p>“Hey, why don’t you move back in?” Hokuto asks, almost casually. “Could be fun, just like old times.”</p><p>Daigo laughs, a light-hearted chuckle. “I live with my boyfriend now, so that’s off the table.”</p><p>Hokuto’s hand stills. “Boyfriend?! When did this happen? Who is he? Why am I just finding out now?”</p><p>The playful smirk on Daigo’s face is answer enough.</p><p>With a sudden bolt of energy, Hokuto lunges towards his friend, the chase beginning. Daigo dodges around the sleek minimalist desk, knocking over a few organized tools. Hokuto’s attempts to catch him had them weaving through the apartment, under the pendant lights, and around the dining nook.</p><p>Laughter echoes. Daigo’s playful taunts and Hokuto’s mock threats fill the room.</p><p>“I have a right to know!” Hokuto shouts, narrowly missing Daigo’s foot with his own.</p><p>“And I have the right to privacy!” Daigo cackles, narrowly missing the puzzle table.</p><p>Hokuto’s room becomes their final battleground. The comfortable platform bed is no longer a resting place, but an obstacle to jump and roll across. The chase reaches its climax as Hokuto corners Daigo near the writing desk, both out of breath and laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>As they collapse into a heap on the floor, Hokuto feels something he hadn’t in a while — a genuine connection, unburdened by past mistakes. Inside, a sense of relief floods him. Relationships might change, but at their core, some things remain the same.</p><p>In between gasps for air, Hokuto muses, “I’ve missed this, Daigo.”</p><p>Daigo, still chuckling, patting Hokuto's back. “Same here. And just so you know … I’ll introduce him someday.”</p><p>Hokuto grins, feeling lighter than he had in months. “I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>

</p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Leaves in shades of red and orange playfully skitter across the school’s courtyard as Taiga and Shintaro step through the old gates. The familiar brick facade of the high school stands as a testament to time, unchanged.</p><p>“Can you believe it, Taiga? Feels like just yesterday we were rushing in late for class!” Shintaro’s eyes light up with nostalgia.</p><p><em>Ah, Shintaro. Always the heart of the party,</em> Taiga thinks. His heart races a bit. “It’s been years, Shin. Things might have changed.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. If it gets too much, we’ll head out, okay?” Shintaro promises.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Taiga allows himself to be led into the building. The moment they open the door to their old classroom, memories of yesteryears flood back. A welcome sign, painted with colored chalk on the blackboard, warmly greets them. The smell of chalk, the neatly arranged desks, everything feels like a snapshot from the past.</p><p>Kawashima, ever the dedicated class president, strides up to them. “Kyomoto, Morimoto. You made it!” After ushering them to sign in, he hands them drinks and winks. “Mingle! Catch up with everyone.”</p><p>Before Taiga can even register the old faces in the room, Shintaro, ever the social butterfly, drags him to the nearest group, animatedly catching up. Taiga’s content standing beside his friend, the occasional nods and smiles sufficing.</p><p>He learns about high school sweethearts marrying, others reuniting years later and then getting together. They remember the laughter shared, the school play they worked on, the backdrop that Taiga had singlehandedly painted that became the highlight of their class effort. Taiga receives thanks from classmates who he had helped mend relationships in peer mediation club, and he has to admit that Shintaro was right. No one talks about <em>that</em> incident anymore.</p><p>After what feels like hours of stories and shared memories, Taiga politely excuses himself for some fresh air. The hallways, once long and daunting in his memories, now seem cozier. Former students, grown into adults but still with the twinkle of youth in their eyes, chat animatedly.</p><p>As he threads his way through them, lost in thought, a sudden collision brings him back to the present.</p><p>“Sorry!” a voice exclaims just as Taiga exclaims his own apology.</p><p>Taiga looks up and recognizes the figure before him. “Matsumura? It’s been a while.”</p><p>Matsumura Hokuto, once known for being one of their most studious classmates but is surprisingly into fashion and make-up, looks stunning, with his wavy hair and sharp jaw. Still, it’s no surprise he’s sporting a look as if he’s stepped out of a fashion magazine.</p><p>Hokuto’s sharp eyes soften. “Kyomoto! How have you been?”</p><p>Before Taiga can respond, a look of horror crosses Hokuto’s face. Curious, Taiga looks over his shoulder.</p><p>He recognizes the lean, pink-haired man with an intense gaze fixed on them. That’s Tanaka Juri from 3-D. He had caught him skipping PE a couple of times, sometimes when Taiga felt the need to skip PE, too, and they happened to hang out at the rooftop.</p><p>Without warning, Hokuto grabs Taiga’s wrist, pulling him into a mad dash down the corridor. Their feet pound against the linoleum floor, distant memories of school bells ringing in Taiga’s ears.</p><p>“Why are we running?” Taiga manages to gasp, but there’s no time for answers.</p><p>Hokuto pushes a door open, and both tumble inside a dim, cramped storeroom, the muffled sounds of the reunion continuing outside. Taiga’s back bumps into what he thinks is a broom — this must be the janitor’s closet or something.</p><p>Catching his breath, Hokuto sighs. “Sorry about that, Kyomoto. Old wounds. Juri’s my ex.”</p><p>Taiga offers a gentle smile, though he felt that it’s useless given that they’re in complete darkness. “You didn’t have to drag me along if you want to hide from your ex-boyfriend.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“Let’s give it a few minutes and then we can leave.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>The dim room around them is cluttered with forgotten files and sports equipment. The two of them share a long moment of silence, often interrupted by the sounds of their breathing.</p><p>Eventually, Hokuto takes a deep breath. “I think it’s safe now.”</p><p>But as Taiga reaches for the door, expecting an easy exit to the hallway, the doorknob doesn’t budge. He tugs again, harder, but it remains unyielding.</p><p>“Oh no.”</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As the dim light illuminates the cramped storage room, Hokuto begins analyzing the situation. A part of him finds it almost comical how fate has trapped him in a room with Kyomoto Taiga, one of the few classmates he actually admired.</p><p>The quiet hum of the fluorescent light overhead seems to magnify the silence between them. Still, amidst the tension, Taiga’s striking features pull at Hokuto’s memories. Taiga forever has the reputation of being the prettiest one in school, but it hasn’t exactly done him any favors. He recalls how the entire class rallied around Taiga when a girl from 3-E barged in their classroom and blamed Taiga for being rejected by her crush.</p><p>Through it all, Taiga remained calm, never once manipulating the situation. He had always admired that about him. Still, that incident, and apparently many others from his past, caused Taiga to always keep to himself and to his best friend, Morimoto Shintaro, who is his complete opposite.</p><p>But there were instances when Taiga completely shone. Hokuto fondly remembers Taiga helping him and Alice patch things up after a very ugly (but petty) fight during a peer mediation session. And that time when they were paired for an art project, and it was Taiga’s idea to splash random colors of paint on a dress Hokuto designed.</p><p>The beep from his phone interrupts his thoughts, and Hokuto makes a “tsk” sound at the laughing GIFs on his chat with Alice. “Alice is coming for us,” he says. “We should be out in a bit.”</p><p>“Good.” Taiga nods. “So, care to tell me why we’re in this mess? What happened between you and Tanaka?”</p><p>Hokuto takes a deep breath. “We’ve been … going out for three years, but we broke up a couple of months ago. I came here thinking that maybe he’ll regret breaking up with me and changing his mind, but …” He laughs. “I guess I panicked.”</p><p>Taiga tilts his head, as if considering Hokuto’s words. “You’re brave, you know? It’s been a year since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend, but the thought of seeing him again terrifies me.”</p><p>Hokuto arches an eyebrow. “Is moving on really that hard?”</p><p>Taiga sighs. “It comes in waves. Some days you’re okay; others, you’re drowning in what-ifs.”</p><p>Suddenly, Hokuto hears footsteps. “Hokuto?” Then comes Alice’s muffled voice. “Are you in there?”</p><p>Hokuto sighs in relief. “Yeah!”</p><p>“Oh thank god, because I just learned today that we have <em>five</em> storage rooms in the entire school, and I don’t have the shoes to go through every single one of them!”</p><p>The sounds of keys jingling and a door knob turning follow. But when the door finally opens, a cascade of stored items topples over —</p><p>Sending Hokuto and Taiga tumbling out with Hokuto landing squarely on top of Taiga.</p><p>Alice shrieks, and then laughs, her laughter echoing in the hallway. “Oh my god, this isn’t exactly how I pictured your second coming out, Hokuto!”</p><p>“<em>Very funny, Alice</em>.” Hokuto rolls his eyes, accepting Alice’s hand as he is pulled up. He then reaches out his hand for Taiga to take. “You okay?” he asks once he’s pulled Taiga to his feet.</p><p>“Yeah.” Taiga smiles.</p><p>As they stand, Hokuto’s gaze inadvertently meets Juri’s from across the hallway. There’s that intense gaze again, and Hokuto wonders, as he looks at his and Taiga’s clasped hands … Is Juri jealous?</p><p>“Taiga, there you are!”</p><p>Taiga lets go of his hand, and they look at the newcomer, Shintaro, looking at the three of them in confusion. “Well, hello, Matsumura. Hirose.”</p><p>“Hey, Morimoto, still cheerful as ever, huh?” Alice laughs.</p><p>Shintaro grins. “Always.” He wraps an arm around Taiga’s shoulder. “We gotta head back. Suzuki-sensei just arrived.”</p><p>“Oh, I missed that old man!” Alice exclaims as she loops her arm around Hokuto’s. “Come on, before this guy gets into any more trouble.”</p><p>“Hey!” Hokuto glares at her, but he follows her anyway. He looks at where Juri was standing, but his ex-boyfriend was now gone. Was he reading too much into the situation or was Juri jealous? And it was the same look when he and Taiga ran into each other …</p><p>What if …?</p><p>“I see that scheming look, Hokuto,” Alice teases, squeezing her arm.</p><p>Hokuto feigns innocence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>The dim yellow glow of the chandeliers paints the auditorium in a nostalgic light. The lingering chatter of the alumni, combined with the soft background music, creates a warm atmosphere. Rows of round tables draped with pristine white cloths are arranged on the floor, and Taiga finds himself sharing a table with not only Shintaro (because that’s a given) but also Hokuto and Alice.</p><p>The image of being trapped in a storage room with Hokuto flits into Taiga’s mind, and he feels the familiar heat rise to his cheeks. He quickly adjusts his glasses, hoping it would shield the embarrassment in his eyes.</p><p>“You okay?” Shintaro’s voice breaks through his thoughts.</p><p>“Yeah,” Taiga replies, glancing briefly at Hokuto, who is immersed in conversation with Alice.</p><p>That was definitely a bad move before there’s a playful glint in Shintaro’s eyes. “Never pegged Matsumura Hokuto as your type to make out with in a cramped storage room.”</p><p>Taiga’s blush deepens, and he jabs Shintaro’s side with his elbow. “It’s not like that.”</p><p>But Shintaro suddenly sobers up. “Look, ever since your breakup with Jesse, I’ve wanted nothing more than to see you happy again,” he says. “When I saw you with Matsumura, it gives me hope.”</p><p>Taiga opens his mouth to correct the misconception, but the sheer sincerity in Shintaro’s eyes stops him. Shintaro has been genuinely trying to help Taiga get out there, dragging him to group dates in the hopes that he could move on from Jesse. He opts for a nod, choosing to let the moment pass.</p><p>As the last notes of the school’s anthem play, signaling the end of the program, Hokuto leans in. “Kyomoto, can we talk?” he asks, his voice soft yet purposeful.</p><p>Shintaro and Alice exchange glances, the former giving Taiga a teasing eyebrow wiggle as they move away.</p><p>Taiga and Hokuto stand off to the side, where there are few people. The rest of them have gone out of the auditorium, probably socializing outside. “I’m really sorry about earlier,” Hokuto says after a while.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Taiga brushes it off, adjusting his glasses. “I just hope everything turns out okay for you, Matsumura. Whether or not you get back together with Tanaka.”</p><p>Hokuto hesitates, his fingers drumming against his thigh. “Actually, that’s why I wanted to talk. I need your help.”</p><p>Taiga looks intrigued. “With what?” He doesn’t know how he could help repair a relationship when he couldn’t even fix his own.</p><p>There’s a weighty pause before Hokuto speaks again.</p><p>“I want us to pretend to date. To make Juri jealous.”</p>

<p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sits in the softly lit office pantry, the pastel hues around him imbuing the room with a sense of calm. The sunlight filters through the sheer curtains, casting a warm glow over his lunch — a hastily made sandwich. He munches absentmindedly, his fingers playing with a sleek business card.</p><p>Hokuto had given it to him two weeks ago at the high school reunion. He had asked if Taiga could pretend to date him to make his ex-boyfriend jealous, and Taiga had said no.</p><p>He thought it was a prank. But Hokuto had given his card, telling him to call him in case he changed his mind.</p><p>“Matsumura Hokuto — Image Consultant,” the card reads, the boldness of the design contrasting the soft colors of the pantry. Taiga’s eyes fixate on the QR code.</p><p>He scans it, and it leads him to Hokuto’s business website, opening up a world that Taiga never knew existed. Apparently, an image consultant’s job is to improve a person’s, well, image. A makeover, if you will. Like the one Taiga sees in TV shows.</p><p>Vivid before-and-after images display transformations that scream of increased self-confidence and enhanced personal style. The testimonials, he thinks, must have been from those who were always ready for change.</p><p>Scanning further down Hokuto’s website, a small set of colorful icons catch Taiga’s attention. Instinctively, he clicks on one, which redirects him to a social media profile. The banner prominently displays “Matsumura Hokuto - Image Consultant”. As the feed loads, Taiga’s eyes widen.</p><p>There, amidst the sleek visuals of before-and-afters, are photos of Hokuto himself, modeling various outfits. And not just any outfits. Taiga stops scrolling when he comes across a picture of Hokuto wearing a delicately embroidered skirt, paired with a soft, feminine blouse. The caption underneath reads, “Breaking barriers. Fashion has no gender.”</p><p>Taiga, taken aback, continues scrolling. Hokuto sports a range of styles, from traditionally masculine to beautifully feminine, exuding confidence in every shot. Each post garners tens of thousands of likes and hundreds of supportive comments.</p><p>He glances at the follower count. <em>Wow</em>, he thinks. <em>No wonder he’s so popular</em>. The numbers are staggering, far beyond what Taiga had imagined for someone he once knew as the introverted boy from high school.</p><p><em>So why me? </em>he muses, feeling the card’s embossed letters. He looks down at his all-gray suit ensemble, pushing his glasses up. He may have the reputation of being a pretty face, but other than that, he’s … average.</p><p>Not someone who’d be the arm candy of an image consultant with a high social media following.</p><p>As he contemplates, a playful voice interrupts his thoughts. “Planning to ask Matsumura out, are you?” Shintaro leans over, his mischievous eyes darting between Taiga and the business card.</p><p>Caught off-guard, Taiga chokes on a bite of his sandwich, rapidly reaching for his water. “What? No! I—”</p><p>“Come on,” Shintaro teases, waggling his eyebrows. “First, you two made out in the storage room, and then you had an alone moment after the program? There must have been sparks! Or am I scheduling another group date?” The smirk on his face is pure devilry.</p><p><em>Maybe if I just tell him the truth?</em> Taiga contemplates but pushes the thought away. The idea of another blind date is unappealable, to say the least.</p><p>“Maybe,” Taiga finally answers, adjusting his glasses. “Maybe Matsumura and I will go out.”</p><p>The jesting in Shintaro’s eyes softens, replaced by genuine affection and concern. “Really? But if you’re not comfortable with it, you don’t have to! I just worry sometimes, you know? I just want you to be happy.”</p><p>Taiga’s heart warms. He’s lucky to have a friend like Shintaro. “I know,” he answers softly, pocketing Hokuto’s business card for now. “I’ll think about it.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The trendy boutique hotel’s infinity pool sparkles under the morning sun, bathed in hues of gold and azure. Palm trees line the sides, their leaves rustling gently with the breeze. The vast sky reflects in the water, giving the illusion of an endless horizon. Skyscrapers from the city peek out in the distance, a fusion of nature and urbanity.</p><p>It’s a paradise – and thanks to a potential sponsor offering Hokuto a complimentary day here in exchange for a social media review, the trio is here soaking up the luxury.</p><p>Hokuto, however, doesn’t seem to fully embrace the moment. He lounges on a plush recliner, phone clutched in hand, its screen casting a glow on his pensive face.</p><p>Alice is floating leisurely on an inflatable, her skin glistening with droplets. “You’d think with a view like this, and on the sponsor’s dime, you’d be less glued to your phone,” she teases. “Still waiting on Kyomoto?"</p><p>Hokuto's eyebrows knit together, his gaze not leaving the screen. “Maybe he’s just busy. He told us he works in mediation, right? That’s definitely a busy job.”</p><p>In the deeper end, Daigo surfaces, wiping water from his face. “Who’s this Kyomoto? And why’s he got you so hooked?”</p><p>Alice smirks as she surfaces, sitting on the edge close to the recliner. “Kyomoto’s our high school classmate. Really pretty. We met at the reunion, and they kind of got stuck in the storage room because our boy here saw Juri and chickened out—”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>—”</p><p>“—and decided that maybe Kyomoto could pretend to be his boyfriend to make Juri jealous.”</p><p>Daigo, intrigued, swims over to the edge, resting his arms on the pool’s lip. “Why not just pick someone from your many events? Wouldn’t that be easier?”</p><p>Hokuto momentarily lifts his gaze from the phone. “Juri had already seen us together. It would be much more consistent.”</p><p>Curiosity is evident on Daigo’s face. “Okay, show me Kyomoto,” he pushes.</p><p>Hokuto hesitates but then he sits on the pool’s lip as he displays a photo, pointing out Taiga. It’s the group photo from their reunion, and Taiga is bespectacled, as always, wearing an all-black ensemble — from his jacket to his sneakers. “That’s him. Always dressed in black, white, or gray. Always keeps to himself.”</p><p>Daigo nods appreciately. “He’s a looker. I can see the appeal. Your visuals combined would definitely be something.”</p><p>“And by the way, Hokuto had a tiny crush on Kyomoto at one time?” Alice chimes in, a playful glint in her eyes.</p><p>Hokuto blushes slightly. “Can we not?” he retorts. “Everyone had a crush on him at one point!”</p><p>Alice dives back into the pool and swims across the other side, her laughter echoing around.</p><p>Hokuto's attention inevitably drifts back to the reunion, and he can’t help but cherish that fleeting look of envy in Juri’s eyes. There's hope. Maybe, just maybe, Juri still cares. Even if Taiga says no, that one reaction was worth all the uncertainty.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>The faint chirping of the birds heralds the approach of dawn. Taiga’s eyes flutter open, the digital clock by his bed reading 5:40 AM. <em>Twenty minutes before the alarm</em>, he thinks, pulling himself out of bed. <em>Might as well get started</em>.</p><p>Padding into the kitchen, the realization dawns that he forgot groceries last week. His fridge stands desolately empty, save for a bottle of water. <em>Convenience store it is then.</em></p><p>The city’s streets are almost hauntingly silent at this hour. The fluorescent glow of the nearby convenience store welcomes Taiga with the promise of a quick breakfast and lunch.</p><p>As he browses, a section of colorful frozen fruit cups catches his attention. Above, a sign gleams, “Turn your fruit into a delightful smoothie!” Intrigued, he picks up a mix of strawberries and bananas.</p><p>After paying, he heads to the DIY smoothie machine, its array of buttons appearing more complex than he’d anticipated. As he’s squinting at the instructions, a tall, kind-looking stranger steps up.</p><p>“Need some help?”</p><p>Taiga nods, grateful, watching as his fruits are transformed into a creamy beverage. But when he raises his head to offer thanks, the words die in his throat.</p><p>Those familiar eyes, that same knowing smile, it’s Jesse.</p><p>Recognition flashes in Jesse’s eyes, just as evident as the surprise. “Taiga! I thought you were … Well, how are you?”</p><p>The weight of memories threaten to drown Taiga. “Weren’t you supposed to be in Okayama?” he manages.</p><p>Jesse rubs the back of his neck, a habit Taiga remembers all too well. “Got transferred back to Tokyo. Hopefully, it’s more long-term this time.”</p><p>Before the panic sets in fully, before Taiga’s flight response could take over, Jesse’s hand is on his arm, guiding him to a seat. The smoothie sits on the table between them.</p><p>“You always did like strawberries.” Jesse breaks the awkward silence, nodding towards the drink.</p><p>Taiga gives a weak smile. “And you always remembered the little things.” His voice sounds distant to his own ears. “How long have you been back?”</p><p>“Just since yesterday,” Jesse admits. “Living off convenience store food until I settle in.”</p><p>An awkward silence ensues, the store’s soft background music doing little to ease the tension.</p><p>Finally, Jesse speaks, his voice soft. “Have you… y’know, been seeing someone?”</p><p>Images of Matsumura Hokuto and the pretend boyfriend offer two weeks ago flash in Taiga’s mind.</p><p>And before he knows it, what comes out of his mouth is, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto revels in the serenity of the traditional café. Positioned beautifully along the riverside, the trees lining the water seem to shimmer and sway in the soft sunlight, casting a calming reflection. The intoxicating aroma of freshly brewed tea and various delectable treats waft over him, grounding him to the moment.</p><p>Having wrapped up his client consultation, Hokuto takes a bite of his mango pudding as he taps away on his tablet, already piecing together the next stages of the project. As the scene of the lime cream scone cake mingles with the Uji matcha dumplings, his creativity ignites, resulting in a whirlwind of innovative ideas.</p><p>Losing himself in his work, he's caught off guard when his phone beeps, reminding him of the time. It’s past noon. He and Daigo are supposed to meet with a makeup sponsor.</p><p>He's about to gather his things and leave when the world slows down. There, standing in line, with a pretty girl, is Juri. Dark brown hair, that lean frame Hokuto knows all too well — it’s unmistakably him.</p><p>Jealousy surges, an unwelcome guest, but Hokuto won’t let it take the driver’s seat. With squared shoulders, he approaches the line.</p><p>Their eyes lock, electricity crackling in the air between them. Their shared history, the good, the bad, and everything in between, remains unspoken, but ever-present.</p><p>“Juri.” Hokuto nods curtly.</p><p>“Hokuto,” Juri responds, his cold tone contrasting with the warm, aromatic ambience.</p><p>Silence is interrupted by the faint clink of teacups and murmurs of patrons around them. Then, as if challenging him, Hokuto’s sharp wit surfaces. “Enjoying a date?” he asks, a tad too pointedly.</p><p>Juri’s face remains impassive. “More than you’d think.”</p><p>The tension mounts. One of the café staff, sensing the growing animosity, hesitates before stepping in. “Gentlemen, the line?”</p><p>Juri clears his throat, glancing briefly at Hokuto. “Are you and Kyomoto Taiga a thing now?”</p><p>A smirk finds its way onto Hokuto’s lips. So he really was jealous back then. “None of your business.”</p><p>Juri’s shoulders tighten. Hokuto notices — always observant, always analyzing. With a final glance, filled with a mix of regret and hope, Juri murmurs, “I hope you’re happy,” before leading the pretty girl out.</p><p>Steeling himself, Hokuto leaves the café, the weight of the encounter bearing down on him.</p><p>But the universe, it seems, has a flair for drama. His phone buzzes, a text from a name he didn’t expect to see so soon: Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p>
<em>Hi, Kyomoto Taiga here. I’ve thought about your offer. Is there any chance we could meet?</em>
</p><p>
<em> </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Walking into the bar, Taiga feels a hint of a Harry Potter-esque atmosphere. Wooden structures everywhere, mysterious infusions lined up on the shelf, and the absinthe fountains gleaming under the dim lights. Everything feels magical.</p><p><em>It’s as if I stepped into a modern-day potions classroom</em>, Taiga thinks, adjusting his glasses, a small smile curving his lips. He makes a mental note to hang out with Yugo here sometime.</p><p>There, away from the main crowd, in his a lime green sweater over a white dress shirt and beige trousers, is Hokuto. To any onlooker, Hokuto would appear out of place. But for Taiga, who’s grown accustomed to Hokuto’s idiosyncrasies in high school, he just looks … well, like Hokuto.</p><p><em>Only Hokuto could pull of such a look,</em> Taiga thinks with a wry smile.</p><p>Before he could approach, Hokuto spots him and gestures him to the bar, signaling him to order. Taiga gives a brief nod, signaling the bartender and asking for a gin and tonic.</p><p>After a deep breath, Taiga joins Hokuto, who’s already sipping on what appears to be an Old Fashioned. The ice clinks softly against the glass.</p><p>“So,” Hokuto starts, raising an eyebrow, “what did you want to talk about?”</p><p>Taiga retaliates with his own raised eyebrow. “Isn’t it already obvious?”</p><p>“Maybe, but I want to make it clear.”</p><p>Taiga sighs. “I ran into Jesse — he’s my ex — this morning. He asked how I was and if I’ve been seeing someone, and I just … I don’t know what I came over him, and I lied.”</p><p>Hokuto chokes on his drink, coughing before letting out a light-hearted laugh. “Really? That’s—”</p><p>“It’s not funny,” Taiga interjects, feeling both annoyed and embarrassed.</p><p>But Hokuto’s gaze is contemplative, more understanding than Taiga expects. “You know, I bumped into Juri this afternoon. Still looks like he’d trade places with you in a heartbeat.”</p><p>As Taiga’s gin and tonic arrives, he takes a sip to steady his nerves. “So, basically, I want to ask if … that ‘pretend boyfriend’ offer, is it still available?”</p><p>Hokuto gives a slow nod. “So you want to make your ex jealous, too?”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head and looks into his drink, as if it contains all the answers to his questions. “Not really. I want him to think I’ve moved on, that I’m doing well, maybe better. Knowing him, even if we broke up, he still worries about me. Is that wrong?”</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “No. Maybe that’s what we all want, right? To prove we’re okay. Especially when, deep down, we’re not quite there yet.”</p><p>Silence settles between them as Taiga considers Hokuto’s words. With a hesitating voice, he asks, “Why did you and Tanaka end it?”</p><p>A hint of pain flickers in Hokuto’s eyes. “We were growing, but in different directions. My business was picking up, and Juri transitioned from freelancer to a corporate job.” He sighs. “Time was a rare commodity, and our conversations dwindled. It wasn’t just our busy schedules. It was the small things that accumulated over time; the missed calls, the forgotten anniversaries, the lack of understanding. One day, a small disagreement turned into a big fight. Words were said, regrets formed. Our pride got in the way, and by the time we realized it, we were already lost to each other.”</p><p>“So why haven’t you talked about it?” Taiga prods gently.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “Pride, I guess. Maybe I want to make him realize what he’s missing out on.” He glances at Taiga. “And that’s where you come in.”</p><p>They both fall silent, taking a moment to process. Taiga then asks, “How long do you think we need to do this?”</p><p>Hokuto thinks for a moment. “Half a year?”</p><p>Six months. Long enough to date without the commitment. And anything to avoid Shintaro’s group dates. Taiga nods slowly. “Sounds good to me.”</p><p>The bartender slides a freshly served Old Fashioned. Hokuto takes and raises a glass. “So, we have a deal, Kyomoto Taiga?”</p><p>Taiga raises his glass in response. “I guess so.”</p><p>Their glasses clink.</p><p>“Buckle up, Kyomoto. We’re in for a long chat tonight.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The bright fluorescence of the convenience store at midnight is a stark contrast to the cozy ambiance of the bar. Hokuto feels a slight wave of dizziness hit him as the cold air from the store’s AC touches his face. The hum of fluorescent lights overhead and the muted sounds of a midnight pop track seem out of place compared to the rich, wooden hues and soft conversations of the bar.</p><p><em>Should’ve had less to drink</em>, he thinks, his mind trying to push through the fog of alcohol.</p><p>Without pausing, Hokuto makes his way to the store's printer section, a destination so familiar yet strange in his mildly inebriated state. Taking out his tablet, he seamlessly connects it to the printer and starts printing the fake boyfriend contract. The sound of the printer going to work acts as a metronome to Hokuto’s slightly spinning world.</p><p>“Do I really have to print?” Hokuto asks, looking over his shoulder. “I could’ve just emailed you a copy.”</p><p>Taiga chuckles and shakes his head. “I studied the law, remember? This is for authenticity. And admit it, printing a contract is fun.”</p><p>Hokuto rolls his eyes, belied by the smile on his lips. “Extra. So, so extra.”</p><p>The sound of the printer indicates the job’s completion, and Hokuto retrieves the two freshly printed contracts. His fingers feel clumsy, and he almost drops one. Grateful that Taiga didn’t notice, he heads to the table where Taiga has placed bottles of water.</p><p>“We probably should’ve hydrated more at the bar,” Taiga muses, taking a sip of his water, eyes scanning the printed document.</p><p>Hokuto nods, fighting the urge to gulp down the entire bottle. He glances at his own copy of the contract, making sure he didn’t miss anything.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This Fake Relationship Contract (“Contract”) is entered into this 27th day of November, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), between:</p><p><strong>Party A</strong>: Kyomoto Taiga, hereinafter referred to as “Kyomoto,” and</p><p><strong>Party B</strong>: Matsumura Hokuto, hereinafter referred to as “Matsumura.”</p><p><strong>Nature of Relationship:</strong> The Parties agree to enter into a fake romantic relationship with the following terms and conditions:</p><p><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>:</p><ol>

</ol><p><strong>Contract Duration:</strong> This Contract shall remain in effect for a period of six months from the Effective Date, unless Matsumura successfully rekindles a romantic relationship with his ex-partner, at which point this Contract shall terminate.</p><p><strong>Termination:</strong> This Contract may be terminated by mutual agreement of both Parties at any time before the six-month duration expires. Termination shall be documented in writing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Kyomoto, you can always add or remove anything.”</p><p>Taiga, after perusing for a bit, looks up, his glasses reflecting the store’s lights. “It’s all good.” A seal is produced from his bag, and Taiga stamps the document with a shaky hand before scribbling his name.</p><p>Hokuto, following suit, affixes his signature.</p><p>Once the contracts are signed, Hokuto, with all the formality he can muster, extends a hand. “Looking forward to this fake dating adventure with you, Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga, a playful smirk forming, shakes Hokuto’s hand firmly. “The feeling is mutual, Matsumura.”</p>

<p align="center">🩷</p><p>The train station buzzes with activity, though not overwhelmingly so. It’s a pleasant Saturday morning, the kind where families are out and about, and everyone seems to have a weekend spring in their step.</p><p>Taiga steps out, the warm sunlight casting a brief shimmer on his glasses. Almost instinctively, he whips out his phone, flipping it to camera mode. The screen’s reflection confirms what he already knows: his hair is not playing nice today. With a few quick swipes of his fingers, he attempts to tame the unruly strands.</p><p><em>It’s just hair. It’s just a date,</em> he thinks. The irony of it being a pretend date is not lost on him. He adjusts his glasses, peering into the camera once more.</p><p>Taiga wonders why he had to agree to the clause on posting their pretend relationship on social media anyway. But then, Hokuto’s world thrives on curated pictures and strategic relationship announcements.</p><p>And Hokuto had suggested they “soft launch” their relationship today, because tomorrow’s social media post is for Taiga’s birthday, one when they can’t be together because of prior commitments. So the official announcement of their relationship should happen today.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes briefly dart down to his outfit. He’s dressed simply: white shirt, black jacket, and white rubber shoes. The gray pants feel almost adventurous for him, having been used to wearing just two colors max. It’s not bad for a pretend boyfriend date, but with Hokuto, there’s always a chance of feeling underdressed. His wardrobe seemed to have every single imaginable outfit for every possible occasion.</p><p>With one final glance into his phone’s screen, Taiga decides he looks as ready as he’ll ever be. He tucks the phone back into his pocket, the anticipation a weight in his chest, With the next step he takes, he’s officially on his first (pretend) date with Hokuto.</p><p>Amid the beautiful late-autumn setting, the outdoor terrace by the river offers a splendid panorama: couples strolling, kids playing, and most notably, the sweet aroma wafting from the variety of food trucks. Taiga’s eyes wander over the picturesque setting before zeroing in on Hokuto, seated by a table next to a trendy-looking food truck.</p><p>Hokuto’s fashion style is strangely muted. He’s wearing white, long-sleeved dress shirt and black trousers. But Taiga squints … he’s not wearing trousers.</p><p>Hokuto’s wearing a skirt.</p><p>The focus in Hokuto’s eyes is unwavering as he types away on his tablet. Beside him, a drink — perhaps a caramel latte — stands half-consumed.</p><p>“Mats—” Taiga pauses, realizing they’re supposed to be on first-name basis now. “Hokuto!” he calls out, now approaching the table.</p><p>With a start, Hokuto looks up and waves. His smile, warm and genuine, melts some of Taiga’s nervousness.</p><p>Taiga settles opposite him, placing his bag on the chair where Hokuto has placed his bag and a paper bag. “You’re strangely dressed  down today,” he teases.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles.  “Well, since we’re celebrating your birthday, thought we’d match color schemes. Plus, matching outfits is sometimes a couple thing.”</p><p>Taiga nods. He and Jesse never coordinated outfits. Jesse always opted for bold, vibrant attire, a stark contrast to Taiga’s understated, monochrome style. However, they did share something special — matching necklaces that hung close to their hearts.</p><p>A twinge of nostalgia hits him, but Taiga swiftly pushes the memory aside, refocusing on the present moment. Then, his curiosity gets the better of him. “Did you and Tanaka ever match outfits?” he asks.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles again and shakes his head. “On our very first date, Juri told me he despised the idea of matching outfits. He was more of a simple T-shirt and jeans guy. But honestly, I never really cared about what my dates wore. As long as they felt comfortable and looked presentable, that was enough for me.”</p><p>Soon, they’re up and examining the food truck options. Taiga quickly zeroes in on a juicy-looking chicken burger. As he waits for his order, Hokuto drifts to another truck, his eyes locked on a pasta dish.</p><p>Suddenly, a couple of giggling girls sidle up to Hokuto. “Um, can we get a picture?” one of them asks hesitantly.</p><p>Hokuto’s demeanor instantly turns friendly and instructive. Taiga can’t help but smile, observing from afar. The girls are smitten, and Hokuto clearly enjoys the attention. But amidst it all, Taiga wonders: how would he ever fit into this dazzling world of Hokuto’s, even for just a few months?</p><p>The two reconvene at their table, food in hand. As Taiga is about to dive into his burger.</p><p>“Wait, we need photos first!” Hokuto whips out a small cake from the paper bag next to Taiga’s bag and sticks a few candles in it. He uses a lighter to light them, then hops up to snap photos from different angles.</p><p>Taiga laughs. “What’s this for?”</p><p>“I told you, we have to post this on social media,” Hokuto explains as he moves around the table to take photos of the food in different angles. “Pose with the food.”</p><p>Taiga’s awkwardness is palpable. He’s never been good with photos, even less so with posing. But Hokuto, ever the professional, instructs him patiently. Yet, occasionally, Hokuto lowers the phone.</p><p>Suddenly, Hokuto's right beside him, phone raised for a selfie. Before Taiga can even react, a soft peck lands on his cheek. His cheeks flush a deep red.</p><p>“You’re too cute.” Hokuto grins, returning to his seat as he scrolls through the photos. Finally satisfied, Hokuto shows Taiga the pictures. “For today’s post, I won’t show your full face, just half. But this one of us will be our announcement tomorrow.” He holds up the cheek-kiss selfie. “You okay with that?”</p><p>Taiga nods. “Ever wonder what your followers will think of me?”</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “It’s no one’s business who I date. Some people said rude things about Juri, but we learned to just ignore it.” His expression grows serious. “But tell me if anyone bothers you online, okay?”</p><p>Taiga smiles, touched at Hokuto’s protectiveness. “I’ll be alright. I know the laws when it comes to online harassment. But thank you.”</p><p>Hokuto giggles. “A lawyer boyfriend! How did I get so lucky?”</p><p>They share a laugh, the tension broken. Taiga blows out the candles — with Hokuto obviously recording the entire thing — and they finally dig into the now-cooling food.</p><p>As they chat and eat, Taiga feels himself relaxing. Maybe this pretend relationship thing won’t be so bad after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The evening chill of the city seems to seep into Taiga’s bones as he unlocks his apartment door and steps into the welcoming warmth of his home. The day out with Shintaro had been fun, but long.</p><p>Without much ceremony, he flops onto his navy blue upholstered bed, the crisp white sheets contrasting beautifully against his dark attire. There’s a momentary sense of bliss, the weight of the world momentarily suspended.</p><p><em>Bzzt</em>.</p><p>His phone chirps from the pocket of his pants, breaking the fleeting serenity. “Mmm,” he murmurs, hesitating. Probably just more birthday messages. With a sigh, he retrieves his phone, squinting at the bright screen against the dim light of his bedroom.</p><p>But it’s not what he expects. A notification pops up:</p><p>“@hokutmtsmr tagged you in a photo.”</p><p>Taiga’s heart rate quickens a bit. Clicking it open, he’s met with the cheek-kiss selfie he took with Hokuto yesterday.</p><p>His eyes widen at the sight of hundreds of notifications below the picture. Comments, likes, shares.</p><p>“Happy couple!” “So cute!” “Who’s the lucky guy, Hokuto??”</p><p>And then there’s Shintaro’s comment in all caps: “CALLED IT!! 😂❤️🎉”</p><p>Before he can even finish reading all the comments, another notification interrupts him. It’s a call from Yugo.</p><p>Taiga swipes to answer. “Hey, birthday boy here! You’re a bit late.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles on the other end. “Happy birthday! And wow, look at Mr. Internet Famous! Who’s the lucky guy making you Insta-popular?”</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes, a smile playing on his lips. “I am NOT internet famous. My … boyfriend just happens to have a bunch of followers.”</p><p>There’s a pause. A longer one than Taiga anticipates. “Boyfriend? Since when?” Yugo’s tone has an undertone of surprise, maybe a touch of something else, but Taiga can’t place it.</p><p>“Oh, uh, not long,” Taiga lies, remembering that he’s not supposed to let anyone know about his and Hokuto’s fake dating arrangement without Hokuto’s consent. Besides, this is easier than explaining the whole fake boyfriend scenario. “We met again at our high school reunion, and things just went from there.”</p><p>There’s another beat. “I’d love to meet him.”</p><p>Taiga laughs. “Shintaro’s already called dibs on the first best-friend-meets-boyfriend meet-up. But send me your free days; I’ll set something up.”</p><p>With pleasantries exchanged, they hang up. Taiga’s attention is drawn back to the avalanche of notifications. But among the sea of icons and names, one stands out.</p><p>Jesse. He liked the post.</p><p>The sight of his ex-boyfriend’s name sends a cascade of emotions and thoughts through Taiga. Does Jesse support this? Is there a hint of jealousy? Maybe regret?</p><p>Taiga’s head begins to throb with the weight of these thoughts. “Ugh,” he groans, the weight of the day and the sudden onslaught of emotions becoming too much. He buries his face into his pillow, letting out a muffled scream.</p><p>Why is life so complicated?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga stumbles out of the <em>izakaya</em>, the night air hitting his face. He blinks blearily under the bright lights of the city, pausing to get his bearings. The drinking party with his coworkers had gone later than expected, and now he’s well and truly drunk.</p><p>Shoving his hands in his pockets, he starts walking, relying on muscle memory to take him home. The convenience store on his street comes into view, and his stomach rumbles. Some hangover food would probably be a good idea before passing out.</p><p>The automatic doors slide open, and Taiga shuffles inside, squinting against the fluorescent lights. The cashier, an older woman, glances up briefly before returning to stocking the pastries. Taiga grabs a plastic basket and wanders the aisles, thoughts drifting hazily.</p><p>Jesse always knew exactly what to get when Taiga was wasted. Two onigiri, salmon or tuna, and a cup of hot miso soup with clams. The nostalgia aches, even through the alcoholic fog in his brain. It had been a year since the breakup, but Jesse still occupies Taiga’s thoughts more often than he cared to admit.</p><p>Shaking his head in an effort to dislodge the memories, he grabs the items Jesse would have chosen and heads for the register. As he neared the front of the store, hushed voices catch his attention. They sound oddly familiar. Taiga freezes, straining to hear over the piped-in background music.</p><p>“… glad you came out tonight. I missed you.” A warmth and intimacy colors the words, even as they’re spoken barely above a whisper. The voice tickles something in the back of Taiga’s mind.</p><p>“Me too. I hate sneaking around though. I think it’s time we tell him.” Taiga’s alcohol-soaked brain struggles to place the second voice. He knows that gentle, earnest tone.</p><p>Curiosity propels him forward, angling down an aisle to peek discreetly at the source of the whispered conversation. What he saw makes his stomach drop, the convenience store snacks tumbling forgotten from his hands.</p><p>Sitting at one of the small tables near the front are Yugo and Jesse. They’re leaning in close, heads bent together. As Taiga watches, frozen in place, Jesse lifts a hand to Yugo’s face, caressing his cheek before placing a soft kiss to his forehead.</p><p>The blood rushes in Taiga’s ears, his vision tunneling. <em>No. It’s not possible. </em>Yugo’s his close friend, practically a brother. And Jesse … Taiga squeezes his eyes shut, willing the image away. It had to be a drunken hallucination. But when he opens his eyes again, the scene remains unchanged.</p><p>The sound of Taiga’s purchases hitting the floor startles the couple. Yugo’s head whips around, eyes going wide at the sight of Taiga standing at the end of the aisle. “Taiga!” He half-stands, reaching a hand out placatingly. “I can explain—"</p><p>But Taiga is already turning, pushing through the doors in a blind rush. The cool night air hits his face again, doing nothing to pierce through the panicked fog in his mind. He gulps it greedily anyway as he fumbles his way down the street, half-stumbling in his haste to get home.</p><p>Thoughts ricochet wildly around his head. <em>Yugo and Jesse. Jesse and Yugo. Together. A couple.</em> The notions refuse to coalesce into anything coherent.</p><p>Some detached part of himself realizes he’s in shock. But the rest of his mind is taken up by roiling emotion. Hurt, betrayal, anger. Who’s at fault hardly seemed to matter. That two of the people closest to Taiga had gone behind his back and hidden this from him—it’s almost too much to bear.</p><p>By some miracle, muscle memory prevails and Taiga finds himself outside his apartment door. He barely registers punching in the passcode and shedding his shoes in the entranceway. He staggers through the dark apartment and collapsed heavily against his front door, finally releasing the sob that had been building in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The warm, earthy interior of the restaurant envelops Hokuto and Taiga as they’re led to a wooden bench seat. Taiga slides in first while Hokuto takes in the surroundings — the abundance of leafy plants, strings of Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and large chalkboard menus on the walls listing the day’s organic offerings.</p><p>A server comes by with two glasses of filtered water. Hokuto thanks her and turns his attention to Taiga, who is silently staring down at the table, brows furrowed.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>Taiga blinks and looks up. “Oh, yeah. Sorry, just distracted.”</p><p>“Let’s go check out the buffet,” Hokuto suggests, standing up from the table. Taiga follows wordlessly.</p><p>At the buffet, Hokuto surveys the spread — roasted vegetables, grains, salad bars, vegan proteins. His mouth waters at a colorful array of organic dishes. Beside him, Taiga spoons small portions onto his plate without enthusiasm.</p><p>“Not hungry?” Hokuto assumes.</p><p>Taiga forces a smile. “Not really.”</p><p>Back at their table, Hokuto arranges their plates and snaps a few photos, figuring that it might be a bad idea to force Taiga to take photos with him right now. He digs in eagerly, but Taiga just pushes his food around, glancing frequently at his phone lighting up with notifications on the table.</p><p>“You should probably get those,” Hokuto says between bites. “It could be work.”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head. “It’s not work. It’s Yugo. My … friend. From college.”</p><p>“Ah,” Hokuto replies. He senses there’s more to the story there. “Did you two have a fight or something?”</p><p>“Not exactly.” Taiga sighs, setting down his chopsticks. “Last night, I saw him at the convenience store with Jesse. Together. As a couple.”</p><p>“Jesse … your ex?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>Taiga nods, pained. “They were affectionate, and apparently they’ve been hiding it from me. I was too shocked to stick around for an explanation. I ran out of there and I’ve been avoiding Yugo’s calls and messages since.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks, processing the information. He can understand why Taiga feels hurt over the perceived deception.</p><p>“I know they have the right to date whoever they want to date,” Taiga continues quietly. “But Yugo’s my friend. And Jesse meant a lot to me. It stings that they kept this from me.”</p><p>Hokuto nods. He feels for Taiga, but part of him is also relieved he hasn’t been in such an awkward position himself. Though who knows what — or who — Juri may be involved with these days.</p><p>He pushes the thought away, chiding himself for making this about him. “Your feelings make sense,” he tells Taiga gently. “It’s a complicated situation.”</p><p>Taiga glances up, looking mildly surprised.</p><p>“Have you thought about what you want to say to Yugo when you’re ready to talk?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>“Not really,” Taiga admits. “Guess I should figure that out before he tries tracking me down in person.”</p><p>“I’d suggest being honest. Explain you need time and space to process this. Make it clear you don’t want him to force a confrontation until you’ve wrapped your head around it.”</p><p>Taiga considers this and nods slowly. “I’ll do that. Thanks, Hokuto.” He offers a small, grateful smile.</p><p>Hokuto returns the smile warmly. “Of course.”</p><p>They return to their meals, the atmosphere between them companionably thoughtful. When they finish eating, Taiga glances at Hokuto apologetically. “Sorry I’ve been so spaced out and weird today. I know we were supposed to take couple-y photos or whatever.”</p><p>Hokuto waves a hand dismissively. “Don’t worry about it. You’ve  had a lot going on. We’ll have plenty of chances for more photos another time.”</p><p>“Thanks for being so understanding,” Taiga says earnestly. “Let me make it up to you soon.”</p><p>“You don’t have to do that.” Hokuto smiles. “But I won’t say no to a future date.”</p><p>Taiga laughs softly, the first Hokuto’s heard from him all afternoon. Actually, Hokuto didn’t hear Taiga laugh a lot back in high school. Which is too bad because Taiga’s laugh is nice — gentle and melodic.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the heart of Ginza, beneath the glowing street lights, Hokuto waits outside a discreet-looking ramen restaurant. Its facade emits a subdued elegance, hinting at the sophistication that lies within. As he checks his wristwatch, the soft hum of the city surrounds him.</p><p>Just then, Taiga appears, looking slightly frazzled. His attire, predominantly black with a crisp white dress shirt peeking beneath the blazer, sharply contrasts with the evening’s palette. “You look … casual,” Taiga remarks with a tired smile, noting Hokuto’s beige dress shirt and pink trousers.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “You caught me on a light day at work.”</p><p>The two exchange pleasantries and make their way inside. The restaurant’s interior reflects the definition of sophistication, yet with an intimate charm. They find themselves seated at the farthest end of a six-seater counter. The pristine kitchen behind the counter makes the food preparation a visual treat.</p><p>“I’ve tried getting reservations here for ages!” Hokuto marvels. “How did you even manage?”</p><p>Taiga chuckles, his eyes twinkling. “Being a mediator has its perks. Occasionally, our clients show extra appreciation.”</p><p>As bowls of golden consommé-like ramen arrive, the pair are momentarily silent, revering the dish’s aesthetics. Hokuto savors the first spoonful, its light yet intricate flavors dancing on his palate. “This is exquisite,” he murmurs.</p><p>Taiga agrees with a nod, his stress seemingly fading.</p><p>Over the ramen, the conversation flows back to Yugo. “Have you talked to Yugo at all since … you know?”</p><p>Taiga’s expression grows more serious. “Briefly. I told him I needed time to process everything before we spoke again.”</p><p>“And how are you feeling now?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>“Still in a bit of a shock, I guess,” Taiga admits. “I may have overreacted, storming off like that. But I felt so betrayed in the moment.”</p><p>Hokuto nods understandingly. “Betrayal hits harder when there’s no warning. You had none.”</p><p>Taiga gives a small, grateful smile in return. Hokuto senses he doesn’t want to dwell on it further right now, so he changes the subject.</p><p>“Tell me about your typical day at work. I’m curious what the life of a mediator is like.”</p><p>As Taiga fills him in on the controlled chaos of his job — the clients, the cases, the firm politics — Hokuto notices the tension in his shoulders easing. He’s always been impressed by Taiga's ability to navigate complex interpersonal issues with grace. Hokuto prefers more solitary pursuits, though his career has required developing some social finesse.</p><p>“I have to admit, I never pictured you being so socially active,” Taiga remarks. “You were always so focused on your studies in school.”</p><p>Hokuto giggles. “Some things never change. My social battery still runs out fast.”</p><p>“Still, you seem to thrive in it. I don’t think I ever heard you talk this much back then,” Taiga points out with a gentle tease.</p><p>“Says you.” Hokuto laughs. “But let’s just say high school Hokuto would be very surprised to see adult Hokuto’s career.”</p><p>Taiga smiles curiously. “What made you pivot to being an image consultant anyway? I remember you studied psychology in university.”</p><p>“I did. Got my master’s too,” Hokuto confirms. “But fashion was always a passion I wanted to pursue. When a friend asked me for a makeover as a favor one day, everything just clicked. Transforming how people present themselves to the world isn’t so far off from psychology, when you think about it.”</p><p>Taiga’s expression grows thoughtful. “I imagine your family was surprised. From what I recall, academia runs in your blood.”</p><p>At the mention of his family, Hokuto stills momentarily. “They were definitely surprised, but they never held me back,” he says carefully. “But we’re … not as close these days.”</p><p>Sensing the delicate territory, Taiga quickly shifts gears. “Well I’m glad you’re doing what you love now. And clearly excelling at it.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles gratefully, deftly steering the conversation elsewhere. “Enough about me, let’s hear about you. Are you still painting like you used to?”</p><p>Taiga blinks, looking sheepish. “I haven't made much time for it for the past year, honestly. But talking with you makes me want to start again. Could be a good creative outlet right now.”</p><p>“You absolutely should,” Hokuto encourages. “I remember when we worked on that art project together.”</p><p>“Oh, that one!” Taiga’s eyes twinkle at the memory. “We didn’t want a typical paint on easel project, so you designed a dress, and I painted on it.” He blushes faintly. “If I did, maybe I’ll work up the courage to show you my first painting in a while.”</p><p>Hokuto’s heart warms at that. “I’d be honored.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto and Taiga step out into the crisp night air, the city’s glowing lights casting a soft hue over the streets. The city is alive, even at this hour. As they make their way towards the station, Hokuto’s stride is relaxed.</p><p>But his internal musings are interrupted by the low hum of chatter from a bar nearby. He wonders why there’s a queue at this hour.</p><p>And then, he turns a corner and sees Juri standing in line, a pretty girl beside him—the very same girl Hokuto had seen with Juri a few days ago.</p><p>An unexpected sting of jealousy surges within him, despite his efforts to remain unaffected. Caught off-guard by the unexpected encounter, Hokuto's thoughts scramble. Should he avoid Juri? Or confront him?</p><p>Before he can make a decision, Taiga leans in. “What do you want to do?”</p><p><em>Taiga. Right</em>. “Want to make him a little jealous?” he proposes.</p><p>Taiga’s lips quirk into a playful smile. “Isn’t that what I’m here for?” He holds out his hand, which Hokuto readily takes. He startles at the warmth and solidness of it. “I’ve got you. Lead the way.”</p><p>With renewed confidence, Hokuto strides forward, Taiga by his side. As they approach Juri, Hokuto can feel Juri’s surprise even before they make eye contact.</p><p>The playful tone in Hokuto's voice is evident as he feigns surprise. “Juri? Never took you as the bar-hopping type. In Ginza, nonetheless. Aren’t you a Shinjuku person?”</p><p>He revels at the sight of Juri’s jaw clenching that he wishes he could take a photo of it. Instead, he nods towards the girl. “Aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend?”</p><p>“You’re Matsumura Hokuto, right?” the girl chimes in. “I follow you online.”</p><p>“The one and only,” Hokuto confirms breezily. He slips an arm around Taiga’s waist. “This is my boyfriend.”</p><p>“K-Kyomoto Taiga.” Taiga blushes as he nods in greeting. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>The girl looks between them rapidly, gears turning. Hokuto feels a spark of satisfaction at the flicker of hurt that crosses Juri’s face.</p><p>“Well, we’ll let you get back to your evening,” Hokuto says airily. “Have fun, you two!”</p><p>He steers Taiga away before Juri can respond, feeling his stunned gaze follow them down the street. As soon as they round the corner, Hokuto drops his arm from Taiga’s waist, exhaling in a rush.</p><p>“Did you see his face?” Hokuto laughs gleefully. “He looked so shocked!”</p><p>Taiga chuckles, pushing his glasses up. “It was priceless.”</p><p>Adrenaline is still buzzing through Hokuto's veins, making him feel bold and playful. Taking Taiga’s hand again, he gives an exaggerated gentlemanly bow.</p><p>“Thank you for your top-notch fake boyfriend skills, good sir. I couldn’t have pulled that off without you.”</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes but looks amused. “All part of the service, I guess.” He gently extricates his hand from Hokuto's. “But really … we’re in this together, right?”</p><p>Hokuto smiles at that. “Right.”</p>

<p align="center">🩷</p><p>Snowflakes swirl outside Taiga’s window, a serene contrast to the chaotic thoughts whirling inside his head. His desk, normally a haven of tranquility, seems to mock him tonight. His potted succulent, usually a comforting presence, sits indifferent to his stress. The deep blues and earthy greens adorning the walls are, for once, insufficiently calming. Even the soft strains of the acoustic guitar playing in the background do little to alleviate the mounting pressure.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes scan the legal jargon on the property deeds without really processing it. However, his brain feels like slush, and not the fun, snowball-fight kind. As if on cue, his stomach grumbles. He reaches for a snack bar in his desk organizer.</p><p>Just as he’s about to take a bite, there’s a soft knock at the door. It opens to reveal Shintaro, already in his coat and scarf, looking like he’s ready to bolt out and embrace the winter evening.</p><p>“Hey, Taiga. You’re still here?” Shintaro leans on the doorframe, his tone tinged with concern.</p><p>Taiga glances at the clock. 7 PM. “Yeah, got a big mediation session tomorrow. These documents won’t review themselves, you know.”</p><p>“You’ve been burning the midnight oil a lot lately,” Shintaro observes. “Is it because of Jesse and Yugo?”</p><p>Taiga hesitates. “No, it’s really about being prepared for this case,” he insists, conveniently ignoring the twinge in his heart. “Go on, head out. I’ll probably grab some takeout later.”</p><p>“Alright, if you say so,” Shintaro says, unconvinced. But he leaves, pulling the door shut behind him.</p><p>Another hour of unproductive work passes. Taiga’s eyes start to glaze over the papers, and the guitar music now seems like a distant lullaby.</p><p>A knock. Again.</p><p>“For heaven’s sake, Shintaro, can’t you—” Taiga looks up, but it’s not Shintaro at the door.</p><p>It’s Hokuto, holding a box of pizza.</p><p>“Hokuto? What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Morimoto called. Said you could use some nourishment,” Hokuto says, placing the pizza box on Taiga’s desk, nudging aside the forgotten snack bar. “And I thought since I’m here anyway, we could take a couple of photos, you know, for our ‘relationship.’”</p><p>Taiga sighs but then smiles, grateful for the distraction. “Alright, let’s do it.”</p><p>The pizza is devoured, and the photos are taken—snapshots capturing a fake relationship that, for a moment, feels almost real. Hokuto’s gaze lingers on the corkboard filled with Polaroid pictures of Taiga’s more genuine past moments.</p><p>“So, what’s keeping you here late?” Hokuto finally asks, taking a seat in the chair usually reserved for Taiga’s clients.</p><p>“Inheritance dispute. Two siblings trying to one-up each other,” Taiga explains.</p><p>“Ah, the stuff of melodramas,” Hokuto chuckles.</p><p>Taiga laughs, feeling his stress melt away like the snowflakes hitting his windowpane. “You have no idea.”</p><p>“Morimoto mentioned you’ve been working late since finding out about your ex and your college friend,” Hokuto ventures cautiously.</p><p>Taiga hesitates, his fingers lightly tapping on the desk. “Yeah,” he finally admits. “It’s become a coping mechanism. For a while now. I think that’s one of the many reasons why Jesse and I broke up.”</p><p>“Oh?” Hokuto raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“We broke up because of a cascade of misunderstandings and frustrations. I was so … indecisive about following him to Okayama. I let my fears cloud my judgment, and we never communicated properly about it. In the end, it was easier for both of us to walk away.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, understanding coloring his eyes. “Lack of communication can kill even the best of relationships. It’s not all that different from what happened between me and Juri.”</p><p>Taiga looks up, intrigued. “Really.”</p><p>“Yeah. We both started drowning in our work, and the time we spent together dwindled. When we did find time, it was like we forgot how to be a couple. The chemistry felt off, almost forced. One day, it hit us; maybe we were better off apart. Looking back, maybe we could have tried to save the relationship first before calling it quits.”</p><p>The room goes silent for a moment. The acoustic guitar music, once a distant lullaby, now underscores their contemplative mood.</p><p>Taiga finally breaks the silence. “Do you think that if you and Juri get back together, if the fake dating works, you’d have learned from your mistakes?”</p><p>Hokuto hums and leans back in his hair. “I would hope we’ve learned by then,” he replies. “How about you?”</p><p>“I’m still figuring out why things turned the way it did, and hopefully I won’t make the same mistakes in the future. Even if that future involves … someone else.” He looks down at his empty plate. “I can’t change my past with Jesse, but I can work on myself, I guess. My inability to communicate my emotions. And maybe this—what we’re doing now— can be a stepping stone to better things, better relationships.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles. “We’re all works in progress, after all.” He lets out a deep breath and chuckles. “You know, this conversation calls for a beer.”</p><p>Taiga laughs, feeling a weight lifting. “Let’s wrap this up and find a bar. I think we’ve earned it.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto is practically glowing as he stands in the middle of the futuristic digital art installation. Streams of color cascade down digital waterfalls, creating an ethereal atmosphere that beckons onlookers into a world beyond reality.</p><p>“A little more to the left, Hokuto. Perfect, hold that pose,” Alice instructs, her camera flashing like a miniature lightning in the dimly lit room.</p><p>Meanwhile, Daigo furrows his brows while typing away on Hokuto’s phone, updating the latter’s social media accounts. “You need a caption. How about ‘Diving into the digital abyss’? Too cheesy?”</p><p>“Sounds just right,” Hokuto chuckles.</p><p>The atmosphere is light, buoyed by the stunning visuals of the art installation and the prospect of a successful social media post. Daigo, though, looks up from the phone. “So, how’s the fake dating scene with the fake boyfriend.”</p><p>“We’re good. We get along well,” Hokuto replies, adjusting his jacket. “But what bugs me is that I haven’t heard a peep from Juri since we ran into him in Ginza.”</p><p>Alice clicks the camera’s shutter for the last time. “Maybe he’s just processing things, you know?” she ventures.</p><p>“Or maybe he’s moved on completely,” Daigo chimes in, eyes twinkling mischievously.</p><p>“I’ve seen the jealousy in Juri’s eyes,” Hokuto retorts, a bit defensively. “I know him. He’ll come around.”</p><p>Daigo wisely decides to pivot the conversation. “Alright, let’s focus on getting the perfect shot for now.”</p><p>But the seed of doubt has been planted in Hokuto’s mind. He separates from his friends, wandering off to another part of the museum—a lesser-known installation featuring light and color streaming through faux water channels. It’s almost like he can touch the light, so he reaches out—and the art transforms, shifting hues like a chameleon.</p><p>“Hokuto.”</p><p>He freezes. The voice is unmistakably Juri’s. Hokuto turns and finds him standing there, looking as ethereal as the art surrounding them.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Hokuto asks, pretending nonchalance.</p><p>“I’m here with someone,” Juri replies.</p><p>“Your cute new girlfriend, I presume?” Hokuto scoffs.</p><p>“She was never my girlfriend. We’ve stopped going out.”</p><p>Hokuto feigns sympathy. “Oh, my condolences.”</p><p>Juri’s face is calm, but his eyes are searching. “Why are you like this, Hokuto? You seem to relish it when I mess up, but you expect sympathy when you do.”</p><p>“I’m not like that,” Hokuto defends, his voice tinged with irritation.</p><p>“You are. Remember when I forgot our anniversary, and you acted like it was the end of the world? But when you messed up my birthday surprise, I was supposed to just laugh it off?”</p><p>Hokuto’s mouth opens, but no words come out.</p><p>“You weren’t like this before, Hokuto. What happened?”</p><p>Hokuto swallows the lump in his throat. “Is that why you broke up with me instead of working things out?” he finally asks, the words a mere whisper.</p><p>Juri looks away, more vulnerable than Hokuto has ever seen him. “I thought if we stayed together any longer, we’d lose what we had.”</p><p>Before Hokuto can respond, someone calls Juri’s name. He looks back once, then walks away.</p><p>Hokuto is left alone, standing amidst the streams of light that now seem less magical than they did moments ago. Tears escape his eyes as the weight of Juri's words sinks in.</p><p>Alice and Daigo find him like this, tears glinting in the soft light. Without a word, they wrap their arms around him, hugging him tightly before leading him out of the installation.</p><p>Sometimes, Hokuto thinks, the most vivid colors are found in the shades of human emotion. And for now, his world is a palette of hues he’s still trying to understand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sits on a wooden bench in the park, surrounded by snow-draped trees and winter silence. It’s ten in the morning, and the world seems to be holding its breath, wrapped in a white blanket. His black coat is zipped up to the top, but he realizes he forgot his scarf. Typical of him to always forget something.</p><p>His phone buzzes in his pocket, but before he can fish it out to text Hokuto, he spots him. Hokuto is a sight to behold, even in a snowstorm. He’s wearing what looks like a kimono top, its blue and white blending with the winter landscape. Floral designs bloom on the white side, and he’s wearing black pants that somehow make the whole ensemble work. Over it all is a coat, and yes, a scarf.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late. The train was delayed,” Hokuto says, a hint of annoyance in his voice.</p><p>Taiga stands up, doing his best to suppress his shivers. “Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Hokuto eyes him, a look of calculated observation that Taiga has gotten to know all too well. “You’re shivering,” he remarks as he steps forward. In one smooth motion, he unwinds his scarf and wraps it around Taiga. The scarf is surprisingly warm, a little piece of Hokuto’s own body heat encasing him.</p><p>“You might catch a cold,” Hokuto lightly reprimands him.</p><p>In this proximity, Taiga notices a mole close to Hokuto’s lips. It’s funny how one can focus on the smallest details when caught in an intimate space.</p><p>“Uh, thanks,” Taiga stammers, his cheeks flushing. For a moment, he’s convinced the warmth spreading across his face is thanks to the scarf. He offers his hand, palm up. “Shall we?”</p><p>Hokuto takes a hand, and for a moment, Taiga convinces himself that this relationship is real.</p><p>As they leave the winter wonderland behind, Taiga and Hokuto step into a cozy restaurant. The interiors are laid-back, a soft blend of wooden accents and warm lighting. Shintaro is already there, sitting at a table, a grin stretching from ear to ear.</p><p>“Hey, you two! Glad you made it!”</p><p>Taiga and Hokuto make their way to the table. Shintaro’s eyes dart to the scarf wrapped around Taiga’s neck.</p><p>“Forgot your scarf again, Taiga?”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “How did you know?”</p><p>“The colors,” Shintaro points out. “They’re not Taiga’s usual shades.”</p><p>With a sparkle of amusement, Hokuto reaches for Taiga’s cheek. “I think it suits him,” he says.</p><p>The sensation of Hokuto’s fingers grazing his skin makes Taiga blush.</p><p>They settle into their seats and browse through the menus. Orders are made—a blend of pasta, wine, and steak. With a twinkle of mischief, Hokuto lets his hand find Taiga’s under the table. It’s a discreet, yet affectionate touch that doesn’t go unnoticed by Shintaro.</p><p>During the conversation, Hokuto leans in close to Taiga, his lips almost brushing against Taiga’s ear as he comments on something trivial. Taiga feels his heart do a tiny somersault. Next, Hokuto casually drapes an arm over Taiga’s chair, his fingertips gently brushing against Taiga’s shoulder now and then. Taiga finds it harder and harder to focus on the conversation, but he tries to reciprocate — Hokuto can’t be the only one acting in this charade.</p><p>Shintaro takes it all in stride, clearly delighted. “I’m so happy you’re dating again, Taiga. And it’s great that it’s someone we both know!”</p><p>Hokuto leans back, smiling. “Next time, Morimoto, you should bring someone along too.”</p><p>Taiga seizes the opportunity to tease his friend. “I’m amazed that you’ve gone on several group dates, but you haven’t introduced me to anyone yet.”</p><p>Shintaro laughs, his cheeks turning a shade of pink that competes with the wine. “Ah, well, maybe next time I’ll have better luck.”</p><p>Hokuto suddenly stands up. “I’ll be back. Nature calls.”</p><p>Left alone with Taiga, Shintaro’s grin softens into a sincere smile. “I really like Matsumura, you know? I hope you’ll be happy with him.”</p><p>Taiga smiles back, but deep inside, guilt washes over him. They’re lying to Shintaro, and that just doesn’t sit well. Granted, he had gone tired of Shintaro dragging him to group dates, and Taiga was relieved that it was over, but still …</p><p>Before he can dwell on it further, Hokuto returns and slides back into his seat. He takes Taiga’s hand and gives it a little squeeze. “Everything okay?” he asks, his eyes scanning Taiga’s face.</p><p>Taiga looks at their interlocked hands and then back at Hokuto. For a moment, he lets the guilt subside, replaced by the warmth that radiates from Hokuto’s touch and presence.</p><p>“Yeah,” Taiga says softly. “Everything’s okay.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto unlocks the door to his apartment, letting Taiga in first. As Taiga steps inside, Hokuto can’t help but feel a certain significance to the moment. It’s the first time he’s invited anyone here aside from his inner circle—Juri, Alice, and Daigo. Everyone else was off-limits because his home is technically his workplace, and he’d like to keep guests to a minimum.</p><p>But now Taiga is here. It makes sense because they’re supposed to be boyfriends, so he has to let Taiga in somehow. This Christmas gathering with friends is the perfect opportunity.</p><p>“Make yourself at home,” he tells Taiga, shrugging off his coat.</p><p>The apartment’s interior mirrors Hokuto’s personality: structured, strategic, but not without a flair for aesthetic comfort. Neutral shades of gray, beige, and black serve as the canvas, punctuated by pops of deep blue, burgundy, or forest green. A stylish sofa of deep blue upholstery anchors the living room, while a tall Christmas tree adorned with minimalist ornaments stands in the corner.</p><p>Hokuto heads to the kitchen to prepare some tea, leaving Taiga to explore. He glances back to find Taiga pulling a book from one of his shelves.</p><p>“Ah, <em>Sapiens </em>by Yuval Noah Harari. Good choice.”</p><p>“You’ve read it?” Taiga looks up, visibly interested.</p><p>“Of course,” Hokuto replies, mentally thanking his penchant for non-fiction that now serves as a conversation starter.</p><p>As they sit down to tea, the conversation flows naturally about the book. Hokuto finds himself enjoying the talk, surprisingly engaged in Taiga’s knack for diving deep into emotional and societal complexities. Maybe this fake dating thing has its perks.</p><p>The doorbell rings, and Hokuto gets up to welcome Alice and Daigo. They step in, decked in comfy Christmas sweaters and holding bags of takeout food. Hokuto’s quick to introduce Taiga, and Alice and Daigo are just as quick to welcome him.</p><p>“If Hokuto becomes unbearable, call us,” Daigo quips.</p><p>Hokuto raises an eyebrow. “Say that again, and your Christmas gift is going out the window.”</p><p>They gather in the living room and start to exchange gifts. Taiga looks surprised when Alice and Daigo hand him wrapped presents.</p><p>“It’s a thank-you for putting up with Hokuto,” Alice explains.</p><p>Hokuto shoots them a resigned glare before handing Taiga a flat, square package.</p><p>As Taiga unwraps it, his eyes widen. “Watercolors and a sketchbook.”</p><p>“Use it for your painting comeback,” Hokuto says. “When you’re ready.”</p><p>Taiga’s expression softens, and Hokuto feels a strange, warm sensation inside him.</p><p>It’s then that Taiga hands him a small package. Inside is a sling bag, just big enough for his phone. But what captures him are the sketches on its surface—personal, creative, intimate.</p><p>“I haven’t been painting, but I could sketch,” Taiga admits. “I wanted it to be something you’d actually use.”</p><p>“I will,” Hokuto promises, and he means it. “Merry Christmas, Taiga.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas, Hokuto.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga paces the floor of his living room, the deep shades of black, white, and gray reflected in the soft ambient light. His tendency to internalize emotions has him in a knot. Tonight, he’ll be meeting Yugo to talk about the elephant in the room: Jesse.</p><p><em>I don’t want to lose Yugo over this,</em> he thinks, glancing at his oversized sofa. It’s his sanctuary, but even that doesn’t seem inviting at the moment.</p><p>On impulse, he reaches for the sketchbook Hokuto had gifted him for Christmas. He flips it open, pencil in hand. <em>What to draw?</em> His mind flits back to the details on Hokuto’s kimono top, the flowers that seemed to come alive in the winter light. Slowly, he begins sketching flowers, the pencil gliding on paper almost therapeutically.</p><p>The doorbell interrupts his artistic musings. Heart pounding, he moves to the door and peeps through the hole.</p><p>Yugo stands there, a mirror image of Taiga’s own nervousness. He opens the door.</p><p>“Hey,” both manage to get out, awkward smiles and all.</p><p>“Have you eaten?” Taiga asks, steering Yugo inside.</p><p>“Not really hungry,” Yugo replies.</p><p>“Mutual feeling,” Taiga admits.</p><p>They settle on the couch, surrounded by a mix of Taiga’s old paintings and framed mystery novel covers. It’s intimate and familiar, yet the air is thick with unsaid words.</p><p>Finally, Taiga breaks the silence. “How long have you and Jesse been …?” He lets the question hang, unfinished.</p><p>“Three months,” Yugo says, his voice tinged with a mixture of regret and vulnerability. “Look, Taiga, I went to Okayama for a photography project. I ran into Jesse there. He helped me get around, showed me some local spots I could feature. And we got close, and then …”</p><p>Taiga nods, urging Yugo to continue.</p><p>“And the reason I didn’t tell you … I wasn’t sure how you’d react. I mean, I was also grappling with my own feelings, you know? It felt like I was betraying you just by considering it. So I decided to keep it a secret until I figured things out. I left Okayama, so I told Jesse we could try long-distance, and I thought maybe we would drift apart. But it brought us closer. The heart wants what it wants, right?” Yugo’s words hang heavy in the room.</p><p>Taiga watches his friend, one of his closest friends, and suddenly, the betrayal, the shock, it all evaporates. Instead, he feels a sense of understanding, as though the fog has lifted. Why was he so blinded by his own feelings that he couldn’t see Yugo’s?</p><p>“I get why you didn’t tell me,” Taiga starts, his voice surprisingly steady. “But it hurt, Yugo. It hurt that you didn’t trust me enough to be honest about something so big.”</p><p>As he speaks, he feels the prickling sensation of tears, but he holds them back. Yugo’s eyes are teary too, and without another word, they hug. In that embrace, everything that needed to be said is understood.</p><p>“I promise, Taiga. I’ll be honest from now on,” Yugo whispers as they break the hug. “But we can set boundaries. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”</p><p>“Sounds good,” Taiga replies, finally letting go of the weight he’d been carrying.</p><p>Then, as if on cue, Yugo’s stomach growls. They both laugh.</p><p>“Okay, maybe we are a bit hungry,” Taiga admits.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, he scrolls through the food delivery app. They spend more time figuring out what to eat than waiting for their order to come. In the meantime, Taiga shows Yugo what he’s sketching, and he even tries to sketch Yugo, just like he used to do in college.</p><p>All is well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The snow cascades gently down outside, painting the world in a blanket of white. Inside Taiga’s apartment, it’s all warmth and muted colors. The soft glow from the string lights illuminates the room, casting a gentle haze over the gallery wall adorned with Taiga’s sketches and framed mystery novel covers.</p><p>Hokuto, settled on the oversized gray sectional sofa, slurps a mouthful of soba as the sounds of <em>Kouhaku Uta Gassen</em> play from the television. It feels unfamiliar, this setting, especially on a night like New Year’s Eve.</p><p>His mind briefly wanders to the past New Year’s celebrations he’d spent with Daigo, Alice, and Juri. Now that he’s single, hanging out with Juri wasn’t an option, and he didn’t want to impose on Alice and Daigo, who had plans with their families. Luckily, Taiga happened to be free — and conveniently so, because they could come up with a couple post.</p><p>“Why aren’t you with your family tonight?” Hokuto asks, breaking the comfortable silence.</p><p>Taiga chuckles, wiping his mouth. “They’re in Portugal. Mom wanted a change of scenery this year.”</p><p>Hokuto hums. “You’re close with them?” He remembers eating soba with his family every year until they grew apart. The nostalgia used to hurt, but now, he doesn’t think much about it.</p><p>“I am,” Taiga answers, poking at his soba. “Though sometimes, Mom thinks she’s diagnosing me rather than just talking to her son. She’s the one who introduced me to art therapy. Though I haven’t done much art lately. Except for sketching.”</p><p>Hokuto’s gaze drifts to Taiga’s sketches on the wall, a soft smile on his face. “Sketching’s a good start.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes sparkle. “Want me to sketch you?”</p><p>Hokuto feigns surprise. “Right now?”</p><p>“Why not?” Taiga challenges. He stands up and picks up his sketchpad on his workspace. “Come on.”</p><p>With a nod, Hokuto gets comfortable, trying his best to stay still. The television is now mere background noise.</p><p>As Taiga’s pencil moves over the paper, Hokuto observes him. He recalls a similar scene from their high school days when Taiga sketched with that same intense focus. It’s perhaps then, Hokuto muses, that he developed that little crush on Taiga.</p><p>His thoughts then swirl around the events of the past few weeks, especially about Juri. Without thinking, the words tumble out. “I saw Juri a few weeks ago.”</p><p>Taiga’s pencil pauses. “How did that go?”</p><p>Hokuto hesitates, looking away. “He said … if we continued seeing each other then, we’d lose what we once had.”</p><p>The room is silent except for the faint hum of the TV. Hokuto feels his throat tighten, and he holds back tears. The last thing he wants is to end the year a crybaby.</p><p>Taiga gives a comforting smile. “You know, Tanaka might just need to see the things that first made him fall for you.”</p><p>“How do I even start?” Hokuto murmurs. Since their break-up, their encounters were only by chance. They don’t have the same circle of friends outside Alice and Daigo.</p><p>Taiga hums contemplatively. “How about, try to rebuild the friendship first? And then, we can use our pretend relationship to, you know, show off your best points.”</p><p>Hokuto laughs, feeling lighter. That was a genius idea. “Honestly? I could kiss you for that idea.”</p><p>Taiga blushes. “I’ll take a cheek kiss for the ‘gram.” He holds up the finished sketch for Hokuto to see.</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes widen in admiration, taking in every stroke and detail. “This is incredible, Taiga. The technique, the artistry … it’s just amazing.”</p><p>Taiga’s blush deepens.</p><p>As the clock ticks closer to midnight, they prepare to ring in the New Year. Hokuto sets up his camera, and as the countdown begins, he films the two of them, cheek to cheek.</p><p>When the clock strikes twelve, Hokuto plants a kiss on Taiga’s cheek, thinking of new beginnings and the refreshed plans the coming year holds.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto leans back in his desk chair, gazing out the window of his home office as fat snowflakes drift down to blanket the city in white. He glances at the time on his computer screen — just past seven in the evening. The only light in the room comes from the monitor’s glow and the soft glow of the floor lamp behind him.</p><p>With a sigh, he turns his attention back to his inbox. He skims through the emails with practiced efficiency, responding when needed. The sheet mask on his face feels cool, slightly tacky. He mentally reminds himself not to take it off just yet.</p><p>His mind keeps wandering back to the conversation he’d had with Taiga last New Year’s Eve. It’s been more than a week, and he hasn’t reached out to Juri yet, under the guise of rebuilding their friendship. He couldn’t just ask Juri directly — his pride refuses to let him be so transparent.</p><p>No, he’ll have to find a more subtle way to approach Juri if he wants to lay the groundwork for their scheme. He picks up his phone to pull up his and Juri’s old chat history (it’s a miracle Juri hasn’t blocked him yet), skimming through the last terse messages they had exchanged — mostly of Juri asking to be let in the apartment to get the last of his belongings.</p><p>He grimaces. “This was a terrible idea,” he mutters to himself.</p><p>He starts typing out a message, then deletes it and tries again. And again.  His composure is one of the things he values most highly, yet the thought of reaching out to Juri first makes his measured words abandon him.</p><p>Suddenly, his phone beeps, interrupting his internal debate. It’s a reminder about the interview he has scheduled for tomorrow morning with a potential new web developer.</p><p>Hokuto purses his lips. Juri had been the one managing his website since he started his image consulting business — it was how they got together, after all. Even when Juri went corporate, he continued handling the site.</p><p>But now, he can’t rely on his ex forever. It took constant reminders from Daigo to post a job opening on his social media, and he finally did it yesterday. He’s hopeful that this new developer might restore some semblance of order and impartiality.</p><p>Then it dawns on him.</p><p>Most of the website’s assets and credentials … Juri still has them.</p><p>The thought causes a minor jolt in his system. It’s a mix of dread and excitement. It’s a valid reason to speak to Juri, isn’t it? He would need to regain access to those materials first before he can fully transition away from Juri's involvement.</p><p><em>Yes, this is the perfect opportunity</em>, he realizes with a hint of an eager smile.</p><p>He quickly types out a message, ensuring each word is precise and devoid of any personal overtones. “Hi, Juri. Do you still have the assets and credentials for the website? I need to hand them over for our new developer.”</p><p>A few moments later, a message from Juri pops up.</p><p>“Hey. I’m swamped at the moment. I can give them to you this week in the evening or maybe the weekend?”</p><p>Hokuto’s smile widens minutely. This is working out perfectly. “Would it be possible to meet at a café this Saturday? Maybe you could walk me through the turnover.”</p><p>Juri’s reply is swift. “Sure, sounds good. Let’s finalize the time closer to the weekend.”</p><p>Hokuto’s heart does a weird fluttery thing. It’s not outright happiness, but it’s something close. He feels like he’s made a little progress, even if it’s the tiniest of steps. With Juri agreeing to meet, he’s granted a chance, a slight window of opportunity.</p><p>Internally, he can’t help but feel grateful for the situation. The thought of seeing Juri again after everything that’s transpired is nerve-wracking, but necessary.</p><p>He peels off his sheet mask, his mind still running. He needs to put together his outfit as early as now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>The automatic doors slide open as Taiga steps into the warmth of the bar-slash-arcade. A blast of heat greets him, melting the snowflakes that have settled on his hair and coat. He stamps his boots on the mat and glances around.</p><p>The arcade is lively with groups of friends laughing and shouting around racing and fighting games. Over in the corner, colorful lights flash hypnotically from the rows of crane games, filled with plushies and anime figures.</p><p>Taiga wanders through the aisles, hands stuffed in his pockets. He’s supposed to meet Jesse here at nine, but of course he arrived early. Too anxious to sit still at home, he figured he may as well come browse the games until Jesse gets here.</p><p>As he passes a neon sign reading “Gacha Kingdom,” Taiga pauses. Rows and rows of capsule toy machines are lined up, filled with capsules of little toys and trinkets. Taiga smiles faintly, remembering how he used to try to complete a set with a ten-year-old’s meager allowance.</p><p>He approaches a machine decorated with Pokémon and inserts a 100-yen coin. With a quick turn of the knob, a red and white capsule drops down. Taiga pops it open, revealing a Squirtle figurine.</p><p>“Aww man,” he mutters. “I was hoping for an Eevee.”</p><p>“I can trade you if you want,” a familiar voice says behind him. “I got an Eevee in mine.”</p><p>Taiga turns to see Jesse holding out a capsule with an Eevee figurine inside. He looks almost exactly the same as Taiga remembers — tall with broad shoulders, wearing a beanie over his poodle-like blonde hair. But the shy, boyish smile on his face makes Taiga’s heart squeeze unexpectedly.</p><p>“Oh, uh, you don’t have to …” Taiga stammers, but Jesse is already swapping the capsules in Taiga’s hand.</p><p>“I don’t collect them, you know,” Jesse says with an awkward laugh. He glances around the arcade. “So, did you maybe wanna sit at the bar? Grab a drink or something?”</p><p>Taiga nods, anxiety and excitement churning in his stomach. When Jesse texted him asking to meet up, he found himself saying yes before he even realized why. Even Yugo was encouraging him to go.</p><p>They settle onto stools at the small bar area. On the stage nearby, a holographic Pac-Man dances and sings upbeat pop songs. Taiga orders a chocolate martini while Jesse gets a beer.</p><p>“So how’d you find this place anyway?” Taiga asks after the bartender moves away. “It’s pretty cool.”</p><p>“A friend told me about it,” Jesse says. “It seemed like a fun low-pressure idea for …” He trails off and clears his throat. “Anyway, yeah, it’s a cool spot! Lots of stuff to do.”</p><p>Taiga smiles slightly, understanding the unspoken implication. This arcade date was Jesse’s idea of neutral territory for their potentially awkward reunion. He appreciates the thoughtfulness.</p><p>The drinks arrive, and Taiga also orders a large chocolate parfait piled high with fruit and cream.</p><p>Jesse chuckles at the towering dessert. “Some things never change, huh?” he teases.</p><p>Taiga blushes. “Hey, I’ve been cutting back on the sweets lately,” he protests. “But sometimes you really need one, you know?”</p><p>“For sure,” Jesse says, eyes glinting with familiar fondness. The nostalgic expression makes Taiga’s chest tighten. He distracts himself by taking a big spoonful of parfait.</p><p>As they sip their drinks, Taiga works up the nerve. “So, are you back in Tokyo for good, then?”</p><p>Jesse nods. “Yeah, the Okayama branch did really well last year, so they wanted me back at the main office.” He smiles. “It’s nice to be home.”</p><p>Taiga nods, poking at his parfait. “That’s great. And work’s going well for you these days? Not overdoing it?”</p><p>“It’s busy, but nothing I can’t handle,” Jesse assures him. “What about you though? Please tell me you’re not still pulling all-nighters every night …”</p><p>Taiga laughs. “No, I’ve been better about that. Shintaro helps keep me on track. And Hokuto’s been really supportive too.”</p><p>Jesse’s eyebrows raise. “Matsumura Hokuto, huh? Didn’t expect that one of the influencers I follow would actually be my ex’s new boyfriend.”</p><p>Taiga rubs his neck sheepishly. “Yeah, we reconnected at our high school reunion and hit it off. Small world, huh?” He hopes Jesse can’t hear the lie in his voice.</p><p>But Jesse just smiles. “That’s great, Taiga. I’m happy for you.” He sounds sincere. “Matsumura seems like a good guy. He’ll treat you right.”</p><p>Taiga’s shoulders relax. “What about you and Yugo?” he asks cautiously. “How’s that going?”</p><p>Jesse blushes but looks pleased. “It’s really good. We’re taking things slow, but he makes me happy, you know?”</p><p>“That’s good,” Taiga says. And he means it, even if the news still twinges slightly. He smiles. “But if you ever hurt Yugo, I may have to convince him to sue you for emotional damages or something.”</p><p>Jesse laughs. “Duly noted.”</p><p>They chatter comfortably for a little while longer about harmless topics - work, hobbies, some things on the news. Eventually Jesse glances at his phone.</p><p>“I should probably get going soon.” He smiles warmly at Taiga. “This was really nice though. I’m glad we could catch up.”</p><p>Taiga nods. “Yeah, me too.”</p><p>As they exit the arcade, he feels oddly light, like a weight has lifted from his chest. He realizes that the dull ache he's carried for Jesse all this time has faded to a faint nostalgia.</p><p>For the first time in a long while, he feels ready to fully move on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto arrives at the café twenty minutes early, shaking the snowflakes from his hair. The warm, rich scents of coffee and pastries envelop him as he selects a table by the window. After ordering a coffee and a croissant, he opens the laptop and reviews the website credentials Juri had sent over earlier, preparing for their meeting.</p><p>He’s so focused on his work that he doesn’t notice the young woman approaching his table until she gushes.</p><p>“Oh my gosh, you’re Matsumura Hokuto, aren’t you? I love your Instagram!”</p><p>Hokuto looks up, masking his surprise with a polite smile. “Thank you, I appreciate your support,” he says coolly as the fan raves about how much she admires his fashion sense and consulting work. She asks excitedly for an autograph, which Hokuto obliges before gently extracting himself from the conversation.</p><p>After the girl leaves, Hokuto catches a glimpse of Juri entering the café, precisely on time. Hokuto’s stomach flutters with nerves at the sight of his ex for the first time since their breakup outside of chance public run-ins. He schools his features into a neutral expression as Juri makes his way over.</p><p>“Hey,” Juri greets simply.</p><p>“Hello, Juri,” Hokuto returns formally with a slight nod.</p><p>Juri orders an espresso and pastry before sitting down across from Hokuto, opening his own laptop. Hokuto notices Juri’s posture is closed off and withdrawn as if he wants to get this over with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Juri launches into explaining the website assets transfer process, keeping his tone professional and eyes trained on his screen. Hokuto tries to focus, but finds his gaze drawn again and again to Juri’s profile, a bittersweet ache rising within him.</p><p>“Would you mind sitting next to me?” he suggests on impulse. “I think I could follow along better looking at the same screen.”</p><p>Juri's eyes flick to Hokuto’s, a glint of suspicion in them as if he sees through Hokuto’s true motives. But he wordlessly moves to the neighboring seat regardless. Hokuto has to restrain himself from leaning into Juri’s familiar warmth beside him, the rich scent of his skin making Hokuto’s heart constrict.</p><p>Juri continues walking Hokuto through the website details, an undercurrent of tension now running through his voice. Hokuto forces himself to pay attention, pushing down the flood of emotions being so close to Juri again brings.</p><p>After what feels like both forever and no time at all, Juri concludes his explanation. “I think that covers everything you need,” he says reservedly as he moves back to his original seat.</p><p>“Yeah, thank you for going over all of that,” Hokuto replies, hoping his voice doesn’t betray his inner turmoil.</p><p>Juri gives a single nod and turns his focus to finishing his coffee in silence. Hokuto weighs his options before deciding to take the plunge.</p><p>“Juri, I was wondering …” he begins slowly.</p><p>Juri glances up, eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Do you think we could try being friends again?”</p><p>Juri looks startled, then skeptical. “Friends?” he repeats doubtfully.</p><p>Hokuto chooses his words. “We shared so much. More than just love. More than disagreements. I genuinely miss our friendship. It’s not about the past, but the bond we had. I’ve lost a part of me.”</p><p>Juri's expression gradually shifts to something softer, more vulnerable. Finally, he murmurs “I’ll … think about it.”</p><p>Hokuto knows that’s as good as a yes from Juri. Relief courses through him.</p><p>The first step in his plan is complete. Now he just has to figure out the rest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>The snow falls steadily outside the window of Taiga’s office, bathing his workspace in a soft, natural light. He sits at his desk, going through the documents he needs for another big session tomorrow. As much as he doesn’t want to pull an all-nighter, the client sent in some last-minute documents that are vital to their case.</p><p>A knock at the door pulls Taiga from his thoughts. He glances up as Hokuto enters, the aroma of Vietnamese food wafting in with him.</p><p>“I come bearing pho,” he announces, making his way over to Taiga’s desk. “Sorry I was late. The staff took longer than usual.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Taiga says, lighting up at the sight of food. “I don’t have meetings today, anyway.”</p><p>They arrange the takeout containers on Taiga’s desk, filling the air with the rich scents of Vietnamese cuisine. Hokuto grabs his phone and they take a few photos together for his social media, maintaining the guise of their pretend relationship.</p><p>Once the photos are posted, they dig into the food with enthusiasm. Taiga’s tense shoulders gradually relax as they chat lightly about their days so far.</p><p>Eventually, Hokuto brings up Juri. “I met up with Juri last weekend, by the way. To get my website credentials transferred over. But mostly to ask if we could rebuild our friendship.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes widen slightly. “How did that go?”</p><p>“Better than expected,” Hokuto admits before recounting the café meeting. Taiga listens thoughtfully, nodding along.</p><p>“That worked out well then. Hopefully rebuilding some friendship will smooth the way for the rest of our plan,” Taiga says. He spears a shrimp with his fork, looking contemplative. “I actually saw Jesse recently too. We met up at this cool bar-slash-arcade to catch up.”</p><p>Hokuto raises an eyebrow. “And how was that?”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “A little awkward at first, but fine once we started talking. I’m over him, romantically at least.” He states it with confidence.</p><p>“Good to hear,” Hokuto says, studying Taiga’s expression. Something seems to be weighing on his mind still. “Everything’s all right between you two though?”</p><p>Taiga shifts in his seat. “Yeah, it’s just …” He hesitates before continuing. “Yugo wants to plan a double date. He suggested it when I updated him about Jesse. He wants to get to know you better.”</p><p>“That could be fun,” Hokuto remarks mildly, waiting for Taiga to go on.</p><p>Taiga fiddles with his fork, not meeting Hokuto’s gaze. “It’s just, I know I should be fully over Jesse by now, but part of me still wants to seem like I’m doing really well, you know? Like I’ve completely moved on.” He glances up almost guiltily.</p><p>Hokuto nods understandingly. “You want to reinforce the image we’re projecting. I get it.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Taiga says, looking relieved that Hokuto understands his thought process. “Not change who I am obviously, but maybe … sharpen things up a bit?” He makes a vague gesture at his attire and glasses. “So I seem more confident and mature.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles. “Say no more. I’m always happy to offer my services in the image department.”</p><p>Taiga chuckles. “Thanks. I know I said no makeovers in our contract, but I think this still aligns with our overall goal.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “You want the Hokuto touch, do you?”</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes again, a smirk playing on his lips. “Just this once.”</p><p>“Consider it done,” Hokuto promises, and he falls silent, probably already coming up with ideas.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The lights of the Shibuya Scramble twinkle through the expansive windows of the café-bar, the noisy clamor of the famous intersection barely audible from inside. Hokuto sits across from Daigo at a small table tucked into an intimate corner of the stylish space. Their empty dinner plates are pushed aside as they nurse drinks and chat.</p><p>“The new radiance foundation campaign is shaping up well,” Daigo is saying, his steady voice tinted with satisfaction at the success of the cosmetics campaign he’s heading up. “Focus groups loved the concept, so now it’s just finalizing logistics.”</p><p>“That’s great to hear,” Hokuto replies, taking a sip of his drink.</p><p>As Daigo elaborates on some production details, Hokuto's phone lights up with a message notification. He glances down discreetly to see it's from Juri, responding to a meme Hokuto had sent him earlier that day.</p><p>Hokuto can’t restrain a small smile at Juri’s silly reaction. He quickly types a casual, joking reply before setting his phone back down. When he looks back up, he finds Daigo watching him with a knowing look.</p><p>“Seems like things are heating up with you and Kyomoto,” Daigo teases.</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head with a wry chuckle. “No, it’s Juri. We’re trying this new thing where we’re …friends.” He air quotes the word for emphasis, a playful glint in his eyes.</p><p>Daigo raises an eyebrow. “Well, well. Maybe there’s hope for your ridiculous jealousy scheme after all.”</p><p>Hokuto affects an offended gasp. “Excuse me, my plans are amazing. I’ve had plenty of brilliant ideas!”</p><p>“Mmhmm, sure,” Daigo says dryly, though his eyes glint with amusement.</p><p>They both chuckle, their conversation interrupted by a waiter offering a refill.</p><p>After the waiter leaves, Daigo’s expression turns more serious. “But seriously, what happens if you and Juri do rekindle things? With regards to you and Kyomoto?”</p><p>The question hangs in the air, and Hokuto contemplates for a moment, swirling the wine in his glass. “Maybe I’ll maintain radio silence for a month. You know, to sell the post-breakup grief. But after that, Taiga and I could still be friends. I think.”</p><p>Daigo nods. “That’s reasonable. I just hope you and Kyomoto can remain on good terms. He seems like a great guy.” He pauses, looking thoughtful. “To be honest, I can sort of see you two working out as more than pretend.”</p><p>Hokuto raises an eyebrow. “Really?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Daigo says with a little shrug. “I won’t deny I think you and Juri suit each other incredibly well, but there also seems to be genuine connection between you and Kyomoto.”</p><p>Hokuto considers this, surprised to find he isn’t opposed to the idea. “I won't rule anything out,” he finally says diplomatically. “For now my priority is repairing things with Juri, but Taiga and I do get along exceptionally well.”</p><p>“Just food for thought.” Daigo’s tone is nothing but friendly and supportive. Hokuto feels a rush of gratitude.</p><p>“Enough about me for now,” Hokuto says lightly after a beat. “Ryusei seems like a great guy.”</p><p>At the mention of his boyfriend, Daigo immediately softens, a besotted smile spreading across his face. As Daigo gushes about Ryusei’s latest achievements at his job, Hokuto listens contentedly, smiling into his drink.</p><p>His phone vibrates again, but this time, Hokuto lets it go. He’ll check it later.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sits on the edge of his bed, fiddling with his fingers as he watches Hokuto rifle through his closet. Piles of folded black, gray, and white shirts lay strewn across the floor. Hokuto hums thoughtfully as he sorts through the hangers holding Taiga’s minimal wardrobe.</p><p>Taiga wonders, not for the first time, if asking Hokuto for a makeover was a mistake. Did he really need to go this far outside his comfort zone? His simple style has suited him just fine for years.</p><p>Hokuto turns, holding up a black button-down. “How about we start with switching these baggy tees for some better fitted options?”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “I guess. Nothing too tight though.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “Don’t worry, we’ll keep it modest. Baby steps.”</p><p>He hangs the shirt back up and continues browsing. Taiga's gaze falls on the large trunk laying open next to him, filled with hair products, cosmetics, and accessories. His stomach flutters nervously. A complete style overhaul is daunting enough without adding makeup into the mix.</p><p>Seeming to sense his trepidation, Hokuto pauses and looks over at him. “Everything okay? We can take this as slowly as you need.”</p><p>Taiga fiddles with his shirt sleeve. “Yeah, sorry. Just feeling a little out of my depth, I guess.”</p><p>Hokuto sits down beside him on the bed. “No need to apologize. I know this is new territory.” He pauses, looking thoughtful. “Can I ask what made you settle into this particular style? If it’s not too personal.”</p><p>Taiga bites his lip. He’s only told Shintaro the full story before. But Hokuto’s calm demeanor makes him feel comfortable opening up.</p><p>“When I was younger, people always seemed to … notice me,” he says slowly. “For how I looked. I got a lot of attention. But it also caused some trouble.”</p><p>He goes on to explain what happened in sixth grade — the bitter parent accusing his teacher of favoritism, all because young Taiga was considered an exceptionally cute kid.</p><p>“After that, I just wanted to blend in,” Taiga admits. “I just wanted to be unseen, you know? To just … be.”</p><p>He peeks up nervously at Hokuto, worried he’ll get laughed at.</p><p>But Hokuto just nods thoughtfully. “I can understand wanting to protect yourself,” he says. “But you shouldn’t have to hide away who you are.” He smiles encouragingly. “How about we compromise? Keep the colors you're comfortable with, but try some better fitted pieces. Subtle upgrades. Enough to boost your confidence without overwhelming you.”</p><p>Taiga lets out a relieved breath. “That sounds good. Thank you.”</p><p>Hokuto squeezes his shoulder before whipping out his tablet. He starts pulling out images of garments ‑ fitted sweaters, tailored slacks, rich cardigans. Pieces that hug Taiga’s frame without being constricting.</p><p>“What do you think?” Hokuto asks, fingers swiping through the tablet as he creates a collage of Taiga’s potential upgraded wardrobe. “We could pair these slate trousers with a charcoal sweater. Much sharper than the oversized tee and sweatpants you usually wear, but still modest.”</p><p>Taiga nods, warming up to the idea. As Hokuto outfits him in the new clothes, Taiga begins to see himself with new eyes. The slim-cut pieces lend his body a graceful elegance he's never noticed before.</p><p>“See? You look great,” Hokuto says. He tilts Taiga’s chin up. “One day you’ll see yourself the way I do. For now, baby steps.”</p><p>Taiga ducks his head, cheeks flushed.</p><p>Hokuto then turns to the makeup trunk, rummaging through the assortment of products. “How do you feel about trying a little makeup too? Nothing too intense, just light enhancement.”</p><p>Taiga gulps, suddenly feeling like a deer caught in headlights. “Okay.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles, looking pleased. “Have a seat up at your desk. I’ll set up my mirror and lights there.”</p><p>As Taiga sits, the room fills with a sudden electric charge. The city skyline outside seems to blur as Hokuto leans in, his face inches from Taiga’s. Taiga feels his heart race, an unfamiliar warmth blooming in his chest.</p><p>“You have really nice skin,” Hokuto murmurs, almost to himself. “What’s your skincare routine?”</p><p>Taiga blinks, flushing. “Um, just water, honestly.”</p><p>Hokuto gasps in exaggerated horror. "Water only? Now you’re just making me jealous.” He winks playfully as he gathers primer and foundation.</p><p>Taiga laughs, nerves dissipating. Having Hokuto’s face so close to his makes his pulse quicken for some reason.</p><p>As Hokuto walks Taiga through a minimalist makeup routine, explaining the purpose of each product, Taiga finds himself becoming more and more entranced. It’s not just the sensation of brushes and soft touches; it’s the proximity, the warmth of Hokuto’s breath, the soft curve of his lips when he smiles.</p><p>“There, just a touch of foundation and concealer,” Hokuto says. He tilts Taiga’s chin up with a fingertip. “Now for a little color …” He swipes a touch of lip balm across Taiga’s mouth, feather-light.</p><p>Taiga's lips tingle pleasantly.</p><p>“Press your lips together like this for me,” Hokuto instructs.</p><p>Taiga complies, hyperaware of Hokuto's face just inches from his own.</p><p>Hokuto nods in satisfaction and pulls away. “Take a look.” He spins the chair towards the mirror.</p><p>Taiga leans forward, scrutinizing his reflection. To his surprise, the changes are incredibly subtle. His skin looks smooth and even, small imperfections concealed, but his features are unchanged.</p><p>“That’s the magic,” Hokuto whispers, standing close enough for Taiga to feel the warmth of his presence. “You’re still you, just a tad more polished.”</p><p>Taiga nods slowly. He looks tidy and put-together. But he’s also undeniably still himself, the same Taiga behind the frames of his glasses.</p><p>“Thank you, Hokuto. I appreciate you doing this for me,” he says sincerely.</p><p>Hokuto squeezes his shoulder. “Of course. Baby steps into finding your most confident self.”</p><p>As Hokuto packs up the makeup supplies, Taiga’s thoughts churn. He feels strangely conscious of Hokuto now in a new, fluttering way that confuses him.</p><p>Is it just gratitude for Hokuto’s help and patience?</p><p>Taiga isn’t sure.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🩷</p><p>Winter breathes frosty whispers over the city, turning the bustling streets into an intimate wonderland of shimmering lights and hushed sounds. A Scandinavian-style bar stands out just beyond a corner, with timber walls and simplistic yet elegant décor. Warm golden lights spill from its windows, a stark contrast to the icy ambiance outside.</p><p>Taiga hesitates momentarily, watching his own breath form small white clouds in the chill. The elegant façade of the bar feels daunting, reminding him of how out of place he might seem there. He rubs his hands together, partly for warmth and partly out of nervousness.</p><p>He wonders why he agreed to this.</p><p><em>Oh, right … Jesse</em>.</p><p>Jesse had asked if they could do a double date, and Taiga accepted without hesitation. He wanted to move on with Jesse as friends, and he wanted to support Yugo as Jesse’s new boyfriend. That, and he also wants to prove to Jesse that he has completely moved on … hence, Hokuto as his fake boyfriend.</p><p>His usual attire is far more muted and different from his usual — slim-fit black jeans, a crisp white button-down shirt, and a tailored gray coat. It’s his usual color scheme, but out of his comfort zone. Taiga actually likes it, but it’s different now that he’s about to meet his ex-boyfriend and close friend.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Hokuto,” he starts, his voice barely above a whisper. He adjusts his glasses. “I just couldn’t get those contact lenses on. My eyes kept watering.”</p><p>Hokuto, looking effortlessly chic in his vibrant, patterned sweater, raises an eyebrow. “Taiga, you look fantastic,” he replies, his voice composed and measured. “Glasses or not, it’s about being comfortable.”</p><p>There’s a pause, and then Hokuto fishes out a dark green pocket square from his pink handbag. “One final touch for a pop of color.”</p><p>Before Taiga can blink, Hokuto’s face is inches from his, folding the square neatly and tucking it into Taiga’s blazer. The world seems to halt. Taiga’s heart races and his breath catches. He’s all to aware of Hokuto’s presence and the stirring feelings he’s been trying to suppress.</p><p>Is this how it begins? Falling for someone when you least expect it?</p><p>Hokuto steps back, examining his handiwork. “Perfect,” he says with a nod.</p><p>Taiga is left grappling with a warmth in his chest. But there’s also a pang of sadness, a reminder that Hokuto is still hung up on Juri.</p><p>Hokuto extends his hand. “Let’s go?”</p><p>Taiga hesitates just for a moment before taking it. Their fingers entwine, both of them adopting the roles they’ve agreed upon — pretend boyfriends.</p><p>They step into the bar together, leaving the biting cold outside. The warmth of the room wraps around them, but for Taiga, it’s the warmth of Hokuto’s hand that means everything.</p><p>The atmosphere inside the bar is a stark contrast to the winter chill outside. Warm lighting casts gentle shadows over sleek wood furnishings and Nordic-themed décor. Soft conversations float through the air, merging seamlessly with the faint hum of music. Rows of taps line the counter, showcasing an array of Nordic brews and guest beers.</p><p>As Taiga steps in, the lingering cold shiver is quickly replaced by the familiar anticipation of meeting old friends. He instinctively scans the crowd, and there they are – Jesse and Yugo. Their fingers casually intertwined, an emblem of the intimacy they share. Jesse must’ve cracked one of his classic dad jokes, judging by Yugo's hearty laughter.</p><p>They look so content. A smile pulls at the corners of Taiga’s lips. He marvels at his own reaction, the pangs of jealousy and resentment he’d braced for are conspicuously absent. Instead, he feels an overwhelming sense of happiness for the two of them.</p><p>Yugo’s keen eyes catch them first. With a broad grin, he stands and waves energetically.</p><p>Beside Taiga, Hokuto squeezes his hand gently, a silent prompt. Together, they make their way through the chattering patrons.</p><p>As they approach, Yugo engulfs Taiga in a tight embrace. Jesse follows suit, his hug warm and genuine.</p><p>“I’m glad you made it,” Jesse says, his comforting voice brimming with sincerity.</p><p>Taiga, pulling away slightly, gestures to Hokuto. “This is Hokuto, my boyfriend.” The word ‘boyfriend’ feels odd, rolling off his tongue, but he suppresses the twinge of discomfort. He’s committed to playing the part, after all.</p><p>Yugo’s smile doesn't waver. “Nice to meet you, Hokuto. Taiga has mentioned you a few times. Please, join us. Order whatever you like.”</p><p>As Taiga and Hokuto settle into their seats next to each other, the former can’t help but steal another glance at Yugo and Jesse. His heart feels light, his emotions uncomplicated. He thinks, perhaps for the first time since the breakup, that everything will truly be alright.</p><p>And as Hokuto’s fingers find his under the table, Taiga knows he’s in good company.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto listens to the lively chat between him, Taiga, Jesse, and Yugo. The laughter and light conversations seem to make the chilly weather outside consequential. He and Taiga seem to be selling their relationship to the couple before them quite well. Hokuto initiates the moments of physical affection, touching Taiga lightly on the arm and on the shoulder. Taiga would reciprocate, leaning in when he and Hokuto were talking.</p><p>Suddenly, a female voice catches their attention. “Kyomoto? Kochi?”</p><p>Both Taiga and Yugo’s heads turn in the voice’s direction.</p><p>“Oh, Ishida?” Yugo remarks, face lighting up in recognition.</p><p>Taiga’s face lights up, too, as he adjusts his glasses. “Looks like it. Let’s go see what she’s up to.” He turns to Hokuto. “College classmate.”</p><p>“Go. Catch up.” Hokuto’s hand lingers on Taiga’s for a moment, smiling reassuringly.</p><p>With that, Taiga and Yugo both rise from the bench, making their way to greet the familiar face. Their departure leaves Hokuto and Jesse alone.</p><p>Silence prevails for a brief moment. Hokuto tries to gauge Jesse’s mood. He wonders, with Jesse being Taiga’s ex-boyfriend, if the atmosphere might become icy if it’s just the two of them.</p><p>Instead, to Hokuto’s surprise, Jesse breaks into a wide smile. “You know,” he begins, “I still worry about Taiga. Not the ‘I-want-him-back’ kind of worry, but just … genuinely hoping he’s okay.”</p><p>Hokuto nods. “That’s kind of you to say,” he says, keeping his tone even.</p><p>Jesse laughs, a hearty sound that warms up the space between them. “Well, the past is the past. I’m glad we’re friends. But seeing him with you now … I can’t help but notice the way he looks at you. It’s … different.”</p><p>Hokuto raises an eyebrow. “Is that so?” Taiga’s quite the actor, then.</p><p>Jesse chuckles, glancing towards the area where Taiga and Yugo are engrossed in their conversation with their college friend. “The little glances, the genuine smiles. I know he’s into you when he makes them. I used to be the object of those glances and smiles, and I’m glad that became a chapter of my life. And he looks more confident now. Did you give him a makeover?”</p><p>Hokuto smiles and shrugs. “Just some improvements in his wardrobe. He’s fine as he is, but with his new look, he’s more confident.”</p><p>Jesse leans back, relaxed. “Just know that even though things didn’t work out between Taiga and me, I’m genuinely happy he’s found someone like you.”</p><p>As the moments pass, Taiga and Yugo wrap up their conversation and make their way back to the table. Yugo seems to be lost in thought, while Taiga, noticing the ease between Hokuto and Jesse, quirks an eyebrow in playful curiosity.</p><p>“So, what deep secrets were you two sharing while we were gone?” Taiga asks, taking his seat next to Hokuto and giving a sideways glance at Jesse.</p><p>Hokuto smirks, sensing a fun opportunity to tease. “Oh, Jesse was just sharing something utterly embarrassing about you.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “Ah yes, remember when we went to Sapporo, when you slipped on the ice and landed right into a snowbank?”</p><p>Taiga’s face goes the shade of deep red, almost matching the hue of the berry cocktail on the table. “You promised never to bring that up!” he exclaims, a mix of mock outrage and genuine embarrassment evident in his voice. In his flustered state, Taiga instinctively buries his face in Hokuto’s shoulder, seeking refuge. Hokuto, taken aback by the genuine reaction, breaks into genuine laughter.</p><p>Wrapping an arm around Taiga, he thinks to himself that Kyomoto Taiga really is one hell of an actor.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Sunlight filters through the blinds of Taiga’s apartment, casting a warm glow over the sleek black-and-white kitchen. The morning chill lingers, creating a cozy ambiance perfect for Valentine’s Day. Taiga stands by the wooden table, surrounded by the ingredients for their puff pastry breakfast pizza. His glasses slightly fog up from the warmth of the oven preheating.</p><p>Next to him, Hokuto readies his phone, opening up the camera app. “Alright, Chef Taiga, show the world your culinary prowess!” he says playfully.</p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath and starts. “Okay, so first …” With a measured pace, he begins to explain and lay the pastry, only to realize he's speaking to Hokuto rather than the camera. A sheepish smile spreads across his face, “Guess I’m a little nervous.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, moving closer. “You're doing great. Just pretend the camera isn’t here.” With a sly smile, he adds, “Though, if you wanted a distraction …”</p><p>Their hands brush together accidentally as Hokuto reaches for the cheese grater, sending a flutter through Taiga’s stomach.</p><p>As Taiga begins layering the ingredients, Hokuto turns the charm on full-blast for the camera. “Look at that precision! Honestly, who needs a five-star restaurant when you have Taiga’s skills?”</p><p>Taiga blushes, feeling flattered and a bit overwhelmed, but he can’t help the small grin that tugs at his lips. Their dynamic feels genuine, blurring the lines of their pretend relationship.</p><p>Time seems to fly, and soon the pizza is ready for the oven. With a theatrical bow, Hokuto says, “And now, we wait.” He gives a cheeky wink towards the camera and then turns it off.</p><p>Taking advantage of the break, Taiga leans against the counter, stretching his arms. He gives Hokuto an appreciative look. “Thanks for making this fun. I was dreading it a bit.”</p><p>Hokuto steps closer, a more sincere expression on his face. “Anything for my … pretend boyfriend,” he teases, but there’s an underlying warmth in his voice.</p><p>The oven hums in the background as they wait for the pizza to bake. Taiga, hands folded on the counter, turns to Hokuto. “So, are you going to Nakata’s wedding?” he asks casually.</p><p>Nakata is one of their high school classmates. Everyone in their class received the wedding invitation this morning — she will be married to her long-time boyfriend in two months. Taiga has nothing but nice memories of her, so Taiga wants to go.</p><p>Hokuto nods, a playful smirk appearing. “We should go together. It’ll be the perfect opportunity to show off our ‘relationship,’” he says, using air quotes. “Plus, Juri will be there. I’d love to see his face when he sees us.”</p><p>Taiga nods, though he feels a twinge in his chest at the mention of Juri. “How are things between you two, anyway?” he inquires, trying to sound nonchalant.</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes seem to light up at the question. “We’re talking more now. It’s just friendly stuff, but it’s a good starting point, right?” There’s an undeniable spark of hope in his voice.</p><p>Taiga’s smile falters, a sensation of unease settling in his stomach. He’s happy for Hokuto, yet why does it feel like he’s been punched in the gut? He swallows the lump forming in his throat. “That’s great, Hokuto. Maybe you should invite him out for coffee or something. Keep it casual.”</p><p>Hokuto’s face brightens. “That’s a brilliant idea, Taiga! Thanks!” he exclaims, his appreciation genuine.</p><p>Taiga nods, forcing a smile. “Anytime,” he murmurs, but inside, his heart sinks. He’s playing the supportive friend, yet he can’t shake off the feeling of jealousy creeping up on him.</p><p>The oven timer abruptly rings, interrupting their conversation. Both jump, startled, and Taiga hurries to the oven. As he pulls out the puff pastry pizza, in his haste, a bit of hot tomato sauce splatters on his shirt.</p><p>Hokuto rushes over, concern evident, but when he realizes Taiga is unharmed, he bursts into composed laughter. “Well, that’s one way to end our cooking show,” he remarks.</p><p>Taiga, equally amused, joins in the laughter. “Guess I’m not cut out for the chef life after all.”</p><p>As they sit down to enjoy their creation, Taiga’s thoughts drift to how real everything feels with Hokuto. Then, he can’t help but wonder how this pretend game became all too real for him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto strolls through the bustling shopping center, the glare of the fluorescent lights reflecting off the polished tiles. He’s with Juri, who’s currently in a mild state of panic over choosing an outfit for a company event. Despite the undercurrent of their past, today, they are just two friends on a mission.</p><p>They weave through the crowd, Juri's eyes darting from store to store. Hokuto, with his measured gait, keeps pace. He’s used to the drill — after all, fashion is his realm, his kingdom. He watches Juri with a hint of amusement, his lips curved in a subtle, almost imperceptible smile.</p><p>“Hey Juri,” Hokuto begins, his voice betraying none of the playful mischief dancing in his eyes, “why didn’t you ask your girlfriend to help you out?”</p><p>Juri stops in his tracks, his cheeks taking on a rosy hue. Hokuto notices, of course, but he’s a master at keeping his face a serene mask.</p><p>“Oh, uh, that,” Juri stammers, his voice carrying warmth but with a little more falter than usual. “She was just a fling. Not coming back anytime soon.”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyebrow arches ever so slightly. The information registers, and there’s a faint, quick spark of something like triumph, or maybe just relief, that he conceals immediately.</p><p>“Is that so?” he says, his tone. “Well, more the reason you need my expert advice.”</p><p>Hokuto’s keen eyes scan the racks of a store with practiced ease, the hangers clinking softly under his touch. It’s not long before he's gathered an armful of suit sets that he deems perfect for Juri’s frame.</p><p>As Juri heads off to try them on, Hokuto’s gaze lands on a suit jacket, its fabric whispering promises of elegance and class.</p><p>A smile, genuine and warm, unfurls across Hokuto’s face. The jacket is precisely Taiga’s style, simple yet sophisticated. He imagines it draped over Taiga's shoulders, the charcoal fabric complementing his monochromatic wardrobe.</p><p>“Would look good on him,” Hokuto muses silently, making a mental note to broach the subject with Taiga later. The idea of them attending their high school classmate’s wedding together, both sharply dressed, is unexpectedly pleasing.</p><p>The rustle of fabric brings Hokuto back to the present. Juri steps out, a little awkward in the suit Hokuto picked.</p><p>Hokuto's expert eye takes in the fit, the fall, the way the material complements Juri’s form. He begins his assessment, his voice returning to its professional timbre, but part of his mind remains anchored to the thought of Taiga.</p><p>The soft shuffle of fabric against fabric fills the air as Juri tries on another piece. Hokuto waits patiently, his mind occasionally drifting to Taiga, but he’s pulled back when Juri's voice floats over the stall door.</p><p>“Hey, Hokuto,” Juri calls, his tone casual but tinged with curiosity, “how’d you and Kyomoto start dating anyway?”</p><p>Hokuto’s heart skips a beat, not from the question, but from the undercurrent of interest, perhaps even jealousy, in Juri’s voice. It’s a small victory, but a victory nonetheless. It gives him a giddy feeling, and he decides to push the fake dating narrative further.</p><p>“Well,” Hokuto starts, a chuckle coloring his words, “we were both moving on from our exes during the high school reunion, and one thing led to another. Things got pretty steamy in a storage room, and the rest, as they say, is history.” He’s not sure why he included the detail about the storage room—maybe to prod at Juri’s curiosity or jealousy, or maybe just for the thrill of storytelling.</p><p>Juri’s response is a muffled, intrigued sound, followed by the rustling of clothing. Hokuto’s lips curve in a private smile, but as he continues, his tone shifts to something more genuine, something real that sneaks into the façade.</p><p>“Taiga’s sweet,” Hokuto admits, his voice losing its playful edge. “He makes an effort to understand my work, you know? We’re both workaholics, but we try to hold each other accountable. It’s nice having someone who gets the grind.”</p><p>The confession hangs in the air, a fragment of truth amidst the playfulness. Hokuto finds himself surprised at the honesty of his words. Sure, his relationship with Taiga is a ruse, but those qualities? They’re real, and they resonate with him more than he anticipated.</p><p>A silence settles, punctuated only by the sounds of Juri changing. Hokuto leans back, the coolness of the wall seeping through his shirt, a stark contrast to the warmth bubbling up in his chest when he thinks of Taiga. Whether it’s the satisfaction of making Juri jealous or something more profound sparked by his own words, Hokuto can’t tell. </p><p>Juri emerges from the fitting room, the final suit draping him like it was made for his frame. The color compliments his skin tone, and the cut accentuates his slender figure. Hokuto’s eyes appraise the fit with a professional detachment, nodding his approval.</p><p>“Look’s sharp,” Hokuto says, but his consultant’s eye catches a minor detail.  He stands, closing the distance between them with a few measured steps to adjust Juri’s collar.</p><p>As his fingers brush against the fabric, Hokuto finds himself in Juri’s personal space, closer than he intended. Their faces are inches apart, and Hokuto’s gaze inadvertently meets Juri’s.</p><p>There's a flicker of something in Juri’s eyes, a question or maybe a hesitation, and Hokuto’s breath catches in his throat. The air between them is charged, heavy with a history they’ve both tried to fold away.</p><p>It’s Juri who breaks the moment, stepping back as if the proximity unearthed memories better left buried. “I tried to understand you, too, Hokuto,” he admits, his voice carrying a weight that belies its gentle tone. “But maybe I didn’t try hard enough.”</p><p>Hokuto, too, takes a step back, the sudden absence of warmth leaving him momentarily adrift. He clears his throat, reassembling the pieces of his composure with practiced ease. “This suit,” he says, nodding towards the outfit, “it’s the one.”</p><p>Juri nods, a cool, detached gesture, and retreats to the fitting room. Hokuto, left standing amidst the racks of clothes, feels his heart thumping against his ribs. He takes a deep breath, steadying himself against the waves of what-ifs and memories.</p><p>For a fleeting second, Hokuto wonders if there's a parallel universe where he and Juri are trying on suits for their own event, not as friends, not as exes, but as something more. He shakes the thought away and waits for Juri to return.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sits hunched over his canvas, perched on the edge of the oversized gray sectional that dominates his living room. Evening light filters through the window, casting a soft glow over the city skyline that stretches across his canvas — an echo of the view outside, filtered through memory and longing.</p><p>A brush is clenched in Taiga's hand, but his movements are hesitant, unsteady. The city skyline he’s attempting to capture is a maze of intricate lights and shadows, a tapestry of life he hasn’t tried to weave in years. With each stroke, he feels the weight of the time lost since he last held a brush. His brows knit together, a silent frown forming as he tries to re-learn every technique that has slipped through the cracks of his memory.</p><p>As Taiga dips his brush in the paint, a doorbell chime slices through the evening’s calm. The brush pauses mid-air, and with a slight shake of his head, Taiga sets it down. Pushing up his glasses, he strides to the door.</p><p>Shintaro, Taiga’s co-worker and best friend, stands at the doorway, a bag of takeout food in hand and a warm smile on his face. “Yo,” he greets. “I brought sustenance.”</p><p>Taiga steps aside, allowing Shintaro into the sanctum of his home. “Thanks,” he replies. “I’m starving.”</p><p>As Shintaro makes his way into the living room, his eyes land on the half-finished canvas by the windows, paint tubes, and brushes scattered around. Surprise etches itself onto his features.</p><p>“You’re painting again,” Shintaro remarks, genuine curiosity lacing his tone.</p><p>Taiga follows, standing a short distance from Shintaro, hands clasped behind his back. “‘Trying’ is the better term,” he admits, a sheepish smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Hokuto sort of encouraged me to start again. He thinks it might help me process my emotions better.”</p><p>Shintaro leans against the coffee table, a playful glint in his eye as he observes Taiga. “You know, I think Matsumura’s a good influence on you,” he teases, his voice warm with amusement. “He’s got you painting again, and he’s made you look … good. I mean, you carry yourself better now.”</p><p>Taiga feels a blush creeping up his cheeks, the mention of Hokuto stirring a flutter in his chest. Images flash through his mind — shared glances, quiet conversations, moments charged with a tension that Taiga dares not dissect.</p><p>“Yeah, he... he’s been a great help,” he manages to say, his voice softer than he intended.</p><p>Shintaro’s smile broadens, sensing the shift in the air. He nudges Taiga’s arm gently, his tone taking on a conspiratorial edge. “So, is Hokuto for keeps?” he asks, a twinkle of matchmaking mischief in his eyes.</p><p>The question sends a pang through Taiga’s heart. Hokuto — so close, yet bound by a script of pretense, still tethered to the ghost of his past relationship. Taiga's feelings for Hokuto are like a painting half-finished, full of potential yet uncertain of completion.</p><p>Pushing the unsettling thoughts aside, Taiga musters a small smile, one that doesn't quite reach his eyes. “I have a good feeling about him,” he replies, his words measured, cloaking the storm of emotions that threaten to spill.</p><p>It’s a statement that holds truth and hope, a delicate balance he’s learning to maintain.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The cold winter air nips at Hokuto’s cheeks as he steps into the flower park, his breath visible in small puffs. Around him, the evening is alive with a symphony of lights. Over a million LED bulbs transform the space into a sparkling wonderland, their glow reflecting in Hokuto’s curious eyes. He can’t help but think how his Instagram followers would adore this magical setting.</p><p>Taiga, walking beside him, looks up in awe, his glasses catching the twinkling lights. Hokuto notices the way the illumination dances across Taiga’s features, adding a touch of wonder to his usually composed demeanor.</p><p>Alice claps her hands in excitement. “Hokuto, Taiga, come on! This spot’s perfect for a photo,” she says, pointing towards a display that makes Hokuto think of a starburst frozen mid-explosion.</p><p>Hokuto and Taiga exchange a glance, a silent agreement passing between them.</p><p>As they pose, Hokuto leans in, their faces inches apart, and Taiga’s warmth breathes against his skin. Taiga’s eyes widen, a flustered pink spreading across his cheeks. He pulls back, mumbling an apology.</p><p>“S-Sorry! I got surprised, that’s all!” Taiga stammers, covering his face with his hands.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. “It’s fine, really,” he reassures, his hand finding Taiga’s shoulder in a light, comforting squeeze. “We can try other poses.”</p><p>Taiga lowers his hands and shakes his head. “No, let me try this again.”</p><p>They reset their pose, and this time, Taiga’s gaze holds an affection that sends an unfamiliar thrill through Hokuto’s veins. It’s a look that stirs something within him, something he isn’t quite ready to name.</p><p>Before Hokuto can untangle his thoughts, Alice announces, “Got it! These are going to look great.”</p><p>The moment breaks like a soap bubble, and Hokuto steps back, tucking away the flicker of warmth that Taiga's look kindled in him.</p><p>As they move on, one of the taller illuminations looms ahead, its vibrant lights dancing like fireflies.</p><p>Hokuto’s mind, however, lingers on Taiga’s expression, a silent question echoing within him.</p><p>What was that look about?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🩷</p><p>The bustling shopping center is filled with people on this spring afternoon. Taiga lets Hokuto sway their intertwined hands as they and Shintaro weave through the crowded aisles of an upscale designer store, looking at suits for their upcoming trip back home for a high school classmate’s wedding.</p><p>Hokuto is in his element, scanning through racks of suits with a discerning eye. His meticulous personality shines through in each choice, the slight furrow of his brow betraying his deep concentration. Taiga follows Hokuto’s lead, a subtle excitement bubbling within him as he ventures into unfamiliar color territories.</p><p>Hokuto suddenly stops and turns, holding up a charcoal gray suit jacket to Taiga’s torso. “I think this color would look great on you,” he suggests.</p><p>Shintaro chuckles. “You two are so cute together. Matsumura is like your own personal stylist, Taiga.”</p><p>Taiga feels his cheeks flush slightly. “I guess he knows what looks good on me now,” he replies softly. But Taiga chalks it up to Hokuto’s expertise — after all, he’s spent years analyzing what colors and outfits look good on a person.</p><p>“That’s what happens when you’re in love!” Shintaro grins. He’s completely convinced of their relationship. If only he knew that it’s all an act between him and Hokuto.</p><p>Well, at least on Hokuto’s side it is.</p><p>Taiga knows his own feelings are starting to grow into something real, though he can’t let on about that yet.</p><p>“Come on, we need to get you try these on,” Hokuto says, placing his hand gently on Taiga’s back to guide him towards the fitting rooms.</p><p>Taiga feels a warmth spread through him at Hokuto’s touch, even such a casual one. He’s in deep, but he has to keep pretending there was nothing between them beyond the fake dating scheme.</p><p>Still, he can’t help but indulge in the fantasy a little bit, imagining what it would be like if Hokuto did have real feelings for him.</p><p>Someday, maybe he would know for sure.</p><p>After trying on several suits, the three friends decide to take a break at an outdoor café nearby. As they sit down with their food, Taiga’s phone begins to ring. He pulls it out of his pocket, surprise flashing across his face as he sees his mother is calling.</p><p>“Hi, Mom,” Taiga answers somewhat hesitantly. He’s not expecting her to call.</p><p>“Taiga, it’s so good to hear your voice,” his mother responds warmly. “Have you sorted out where you’ll be staying for your high school’s wedding? You know, you should stay with us.”</p><p>Taiga opens his mouth, but before he can respond, his mother barrels on.</p><p>“And I want to ask about this boyfriend I’ve heard you have now!”</p><p>Taiga freezes, shocked. How did she know about that? As far as his family back home knew, he was single since his breakup with Jesse. “Um, b-boyfriend?” he stammers.</p><p>Hokuto’s fork hovers mid-bite, tilting his head toward Taiga, while Shintaro grins from across the table.</p><p>“Looks like you just got caught, Taiga,” Shintaro teases.</p><p>“Yes! A friend of mine follows this influencer online, and she recognized you in some of his Instagram photos. She sent me the link to his profile. Matsumura Hokuto, right? Your high school classmate? You two look adorable together!”</p><p>Taiga feels his stomach drop. Of course, Hokuto has a huge online following. Their pretend coupling is now spreading beyond what he imagined.</p><p>His mother seems to sense Hokuto’s presence. “Oh, is he there with you right now? Can I speak to him?” she suddenly asks, an eager tone in her voice.</p><p>Taiga panics. His eyes dart to Hokuto, silently pleading for help.</p><p>“I suppose I should properly introduce myself to your mother,” Hokuto says calmly as he shifts closer to Taiga.</p><p>“Good luck,” Taiga whispers as he puts the phone on Speaker mode. His heart races as Hokuto pulls him close, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>“Hello, Kyomoto-san, this is Matsumura Hokuto,” he greets smoothly. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, even if just over the phone for now.”</p><p>“Oh please, call me Hiromi!” she responds warmly. “I’m so excited to meet the young man who has captured my son’s heart. Will you be attending the wedding with him?”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I am, Hiromi-san.”</p><p>“Wonderful!” Her voice perks up with excitement. “You must simply stay with us during the wedding visit!”</p><p>Hokuto smiles politely. “That’s very kind of you to offer. I appreciate the hospitality.”</p><p>“We have a spare room, but I suppose you would probably prefer to stay in Taiga’s room with him,” she adds cheekily.</p><p>Both Taiga and Hokuto blush at the implication.</p><p>“Th-thank you, we’ll work out arrangements when we arrive,” Hokuto manages to respond diplomatically.</p><p>“Wonderful!” Taiga’s mother says happily. “Well, I’ll let you boys get back to your little date. See you soon!”</p><p>After they say goodbye, Taiga buries his face in his hands. “I’m so sorry about this,” he groans.</p><p>Hokuto just laughs and pats his shoulder reassuringly. “Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I’m sure your parents are old enough to understand that you two have … needs,” Shintaro chimes in with a waggle of his eyebrows.</p><p>Taiga groans again and throws a tissue at Shintaro’s direction.</p><p>As the afternoon begins to mellow into evening, the bustling sounds of the shopping center fade into the background. Taiga and Hokuto find themselves walking hand in hand, their steps in sync, while Shintaro, with a wave and a playful “See you guys later!” strides ahead, leaving the two alone.</p><p>Breaking the comfortable silence, Taiga glances at Hokuto. “I’m sorry about my mom’s invitation,” he begins, pushing his glasses up slightly. “She can be forward a lot of times.”</p><p>Hokuto offers a small, composed smile. “It’s okay, Taiga. It’s all part of the pretend relationship, right?”</p><p>Taiga feels a mix of gratitude and unease. “I can sneak in a spare mattress in my room, you know, to make it less awkward.”</p><p>But Hokuto gently shakes his head, his gaze firm. “No need for that. We wouldn’t want to raise suspicions, right? Besides, there’s nothing wrong with two friends sharing a bed.”</p><p>Taiga feels a stir of something deeper, a realization of the blurred lines and his own burgeoning feelings for Hokuto. He nods quietly, choosing not to voice his inner turmoil.</p><p>As they walk, Taiga becomes aware of their entwined hands, a connection that had felt natural just moments ago. He looks down at their fingers, intertwined as if they perfectly belong. A part of him yearns to hold on, to not let this moment end, but reality nudges him gently.</p><p>Or rather, Hokuto is the first to realize it, as he releases Taiga’s hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>In their favorite restaurant, Hokuto and Alice sit across from each other, the air filled with the comforting hum of soft conversations. The two of them pick at the remains of their late lunch as they discuss plans for an upcoming client consultation.</p><p>“I think we should definitely highlight some of the lifestyle shots from the Holland campaign,” Alice says. “Those really captured the free-spirited vibe we want for this new client.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, steepling his hands on the table in front of him. “Yeah, I agree. I’ll pull together a presentation outline and send it to you later today.”</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted as a server came by to clear their plates. After he leaves, Hokuto’s phone buzzed with a new text notification. He glances down at the screen.</p><p>“It’s from Juri,” he explains casually to Alice. Hokuto opens the message and he’s greeted with a funny photo that brings a small, involuntary smile to Hokuto’s face. Juri loves sending him random photos.</p><p>“You and Juri seem to be getting along well again,” Alice remarks.</p><p>Hokuto’s smile fades slightly. “Yeah, we’re slowly becoming friends again,” he admits. He looks away for a moment, his thoughts drifting to the complexities of his and Juri’s past. Then, he glances at Alice again. “But that’s just it, Alice. We’re just friends, and it’s … frustrating.” His fingers tap against the table. “There’s only a month left until Taiga and I end our fake dating act. I hoped it would make Juri realize what he’s missing, make him … jealous, perhaps. But there’s no sign of that happening.”</p><p>Alice leans forward. “Have you considered actually moving on? Or,” she adds, a playful glint in her eye, “dating Taiga for real?”</p><p>The question catches Hokuto off guard. The thought of dating Taiga—genuinely dating him—sends an unexpected flutter through his heart. They’ve been getting along remarkably well, their camaraderie extending beyond the boundaries of their fake relationship.</p><p>But the idea of something real with Taiga? It had never crossed his mind. After all, Taiga’s purpose for their arrangement had been fulfilled, and he’s likely just waiting for Hokuto's part of the contract to conclude. A considerate gesture, Hokuto muses.</p><p>Alice watches Hokuto closely. “Sometimes, feelings can’t be forced,” she says, her voice calm and sincere. “Let things happen naturally. If Juri doesn’t show interest by the end of your fake dating contract, maybe it’s a sign for you to move on.”</p><p>As they ponder over Alice’s words, Hokuto’s phone buzzes again. This time, it’s from Taiga, showing a picture of himself holding a dark green shirt. A slow departure from his usual color scheme.</p><p>Hokuto doesn't immediately realize it, but his smile has widened significantly at the sight. The image of Taiga, looking content with his choice of clothing, somehow brings a warmth to Hokuto’s chest, a feeling he can’t quite place.</p><p>His eyes linger on the photo from Taiga, a soft smile still playing on his lips. Compelled by a sudden impulse, he types a quick message, asking Taiga if he’d like to grab dinner that night.</p><p>The reply comes swiftly; Taiga is pulling an all-nighter at the office.</p><p>But then, an idea strikes Hokuto. He offers to drop by with takeout, a gesture that feels both appropriate and considerate, befitting their roles as fake boyfriends and the genuine friendship they have nurtured.</p><p>Taiga’s response is filled with gratitude, a simple ‘thank you’ that carries more warmth than expected.</p><p>The evening finds Hokuto standing in front of Taiga's office, a bag of aromatic Chinese takeout in hand. The office building looms large against the darkening sky, its windows glowing with the late hours of work.</p><p>Stepping inside, Hokuto navigates the quiet halls, his footsteps a soft echo in the empty space. He finds Taiga’s office easily, the door slightly ajar. Taiga sits at his desk, glasses perched on his nose, deeply engrossed in his work. He’s the picture of focus, his attention fully absorbed by the task at hand.</p><p>At Hokuto’s knock, Taiga looks up, his expression shifting from concentration to surprised gratitude. He rises from his desk, a fluid movement that speaks of long hours spent in the same position. “You actually came,” he says, his voice soft but filled with warmth.</p><p>“I wouldn’t leave you to starve,” Hokuto replies with a hint of dry humor.</p><p>As they move towards the office pantry, their arms brush in the narrow hallway, a fleeting contact that sends an unexpected jolt through Hokuto. For a moment, his heart skips, and his mind races.</p><p>Taiga, seemingly oblivious to the momentary disruption, leads the way with a gentle ease. Hokuto follows, trying to dismiss the flutter in his chest as nothing more than a physical reaction. Yet, the brief touch lingers in his mind.</p><p>As they eat, the conversation drifts to their high school classmate’s upcoming wedding.</p><p>“We’re set to leave on Friday evening,” Taiga mentions casually, his voice calm as he breaks a piece of crispy spring roll. “My mom practically went grocery shopping to feed us for a month, so, uh, prepare yourself for that.”</p><p>Hokuto hums thoughtfully. “I should buy a gift for your parents,” he muses, the words more to himself than to Taiga.</p><p>Taiga chuckles softly. “Don’t be too nice,” he says lightheartedly. “They might start missing you when we break up.”</p><p>The words hang in the air, followed by an awkward silence. They used to take their impending breakup lightheartedly, but now he can’t find himself to joke about it.</p><p>Hokuto shifts uncomfortably. “I’ll try not to make too much of an impression,” he responds, sipping his tea to hide the awkwardness he’s feeling.</p><p>The atmosphere shifts as Taiga brings up Juri. “Will he be at the wedding?”</p><p>Hokuto nods, a tightness forming in his chest. “Yeah, he will. We’re getting along, but not enough to … you know.” He trails off, the unspoken words hanging between them.</p><p>“And if he doesn’t want to get back together?” Taiga’s question is gentle, probing beneath the surface.</p><p>Hokuto pauses, the reality of the situation settling heavily on him. “Then maybe it’s time for me to move on,” he admits.</p><p>Taiga’s response is immediate. “There are still two months left,” he says softly.</p><p>Hokuto wonders why Taiga’s smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Thanks, Taiga,” he says instead, a small smile gracing his lips. “I won’t lose hope.”</p><p>Their dinner concludes in a contemplative silence, the clinking of chopsticks and the soft rustle of takeout boxes the only sounds in the dimly lit pantry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>The air is crisp as Taiga, Hokuto, and Shintaro step out of the train station. Taiga scans the scattered people for his father’s familiar face, finally spotting him standing near a bench.</p><p>“Dad!” Taiga calls out, quickening his pace.</p><p>Masaki’s face lights up when he sees his son. He pulls Taiga into a tight hug. “It’s so good to see you,” he says warmly. Masaki embraces Shintaro next, patting him firmly on the back.</p><p>Then, he turns to Hokuto, looking over appraisingly before shaking his hand in a polite but slightly distant manner. “Nice to meet you, Matsumura. Please, call me Masaki.”</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you Masaki-san,” Hokuto replies with a courteous nod. “But please, call me Hokuto.”</p><p>“Hokuto, then.” Masaki claps his hands together. “Shall we head to the car? I’m parked just over there.”</p><p>The four of them make their way across the parking lot. Masaki unlocks a silver sedan and opens the driver’s side door. “Go ahead and get comfortable,” he said, glancing at the three young men.</p><p>Shintaro claims the front passenger seat while Taiga and Hokuto slide into the back, sitting close together. Taiga feels a flutter of nerves in his stomach. He hopes his father won’t suspect Hokuto’s just a pretend boyfriend. He holds Hokuto’s hand just to make it believable, and Hokuto entwines their fingers.</p><p>As Masaki pulls out of the parking lot, he looks at Hokuto in the rearview mirror. “So Hokuto, my wife tells me you’re a fashion consultant?”</p><p>“Yes, I work as an independent image consultant and style advisor,” Hokuto replies evenly, squeezing Taiga’s hand. “I help clients embrace their personal and professional image.”</p><p>“Interesting, interesting,” Masaki muses. “Your name sounds familiar. Did you go to school with Taiga and Shintaro?”</p><p>“I did,” Hokuto confirms. “Though we didn’t talk much back then.”</p><p>“But Hokuto and I teamed up for an art project once. I painted a dress he designed,” Taiga chimes in. “Hokuto really had a flair for fashion design back then.”</p><p>“You’re too kind, <em>babe</em>, your artwork really brought the whole concept together,” Hokuto responds smoothly, playfully pinching Taiga’s cheek.</p><p>“My wife loved that dress so much, I think she still has it packed away in the attic somewhere,” Masaki chuckles.</p><p>The conversation flows easily after that, with Masaki asking more about Hokuto’s work and daily life. Hokuto answers politely and concisely, while Taiga chimes in occasionally, subtly emphasizing how perfectly he and Hokuto complement each other.</p><p>Shintaro fills any lulls, skillfully redirecting the discussion to keep it light and positive. Then he mentions, “Taiga’s been painting again lately too. I think Hokuto has really inspired him to start up that old hobby.”</p><p>Curious looks come from both Masaki and Hokuto. Taiga feels his cheeks flush, embarrassed that he’s been found out. It’s not that he was purposefully hiding it — it’s just that he didn’t have the opportunity to tell anyone yet.</p><p>“Oh, well …” he stammers, not meeting any of the gazes. “Hokuto and I were talking about our past relationships at one point. He suggested picking up painting again as a way to process emotions. I figured it was worth a try.”</p><p>Masaki glances between Taiga and Hokuto, looking impressed. Meanwhile, Hokuto gives Taiga a surprised yet touched expression. Taiga just smiles warmly back at him.</p><p>After dropping Shintaro off at his home, they drive towards the Kyomoto residence, a charming blend of French countryside elegance and Asian aesthetics.</p><p>Hiromi welcomes them at the door with a bright, inviting smile. She hugs Taiga tightly. “It’s so good to have you back, sweetie,” she says warmly. Then, turning to Hokuto, she extends her arms, embracing him as if he’s already a part of the family. “Welcome to our home, Hokuto!”</p><p>Inside, the dinner table is set in a casual, inviting manner. The walls of the dining room are adorned with Taiga’s childhood paintings, each telling a silent story of his younger years.</p><p>As they sit down to dinner, Hiromi wastes no time in engaging Hokuto in conversation. “Hokuto, I’ve browsed through your social media page. Working in fashion must be quite fascinating,” she remarks, her tone laced with genuine interest.</p><p>“Yes, it’s quite rewarding,” Hokuto responds with composure as he digs into Hiromi’s pasta, her signature dish. “Helping people present their best selves is fulfilling in many ways.”</p><p>“It’s an art form on its own, right?” Masaki adds. “Just like Taiga’s paintings here.” He gestures towards the walls with a proud smile.</p><p>Taiga is content to observe Hokuto charm his family with ease. Hokuto engages Masaki in a thoughtful dialogue about retirement and passions in life. With Hiromi, he finds common ground discussing design aesthetics and balancing creativity with practicality.</p><p>Watching Hokuto blend in so naturally, interacting with his parents as if they’ve known each other for years, Taiga feels a bittersweet ache in his heart. He knows this picture-perfect relationship isn’t real, no matter how much it feels like Hokuto belongs here with the Kyomotos.</p><p>When this is all over, his parents will be disappointed. They’ve clearly already come to adore his polite, intelligent fake boyfriend. Taiga wonders if he’s being selfish, letting his whole family get attached for the sake of this pretend relationship.</p><p>But the thought of losing Hokuto himself — the connection they’ve built, the ways Hokuto understands and complements Taiga like no one else — hurts most of all. Taiga knows he’ll be the one most devastated when Hokuto inevitably walks away.</p><p>Pushing those gloomy thoughts aside for now, Taiga smiles and rejoins the lively dinner conversation. He savors this moment, surrounded by the people he loves most, even if one of them is only there temporarily.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto follows Taiga to his bedroom after they finish dinner. As they ascend the stairs, Hokuto feels a peculiar sensation in his stomach — a mix of anticipation and a strange, unfamiliar nervousness. Despite acting calm about sharing a bed earlier, Hokuto feels a nervous flutter in his stomach now that they are actually here in Taiga’s bedroom.</p><p>Taiga’s bedroom door swings open, revealing a space that feels both intimate and unfamiliar. The walls are adorned with soft, muted tones, reminiscent of a sun-kissed Provencal landscape, giving the room a serene, almost poetic aura. Light-hued wooden furniture adds warmth, while the intricate Asian-inspired patterns on the bedspread and curtains hint at a refined aesthetic taste. The room, however, has an untouched quality to it, as if it hasn’t been lived in for some time.</p><p>Hokuto steps inside, his eyes scanning the room. He notes the paintings on the walls — each one a delicate balance of color and emotion.</p><p>“I like this one,” he comments, walking over to study a canvas hung above Taiga’s desk. It’s an abstract piece, all swirling blues and greens. He’s not usually one for abstract art, preferring clean lines and minimalism, but the colors are soothing.</p><p>“Thanks,” Taiga says, smiling. “I painted that before graduation.”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes drift to the framed photos along the wall. There are the usual family pictures — Taiga as a baby, as a young boy, standing with his parents and siblings at various ages. Hokuto smiles when he spots their high school class picture. He and Taiga stand on opposite sides of the group, not interacting. Who would have thought back then that one day they’d be fake dating?</p><p>His gaze lands on a photo of Taiga from maybe two years ago. He’s dressed in his signature black shirt, his expression serious behind black-framed glasses. Hokuto notices that in all the recent photos Taiga blends into the background, wearing dark colors that allow him to fade into the shadows.</p><p>“The bathroom is through there,” Taiga says, interrupting Hokuto’s thoughts with a point toward a door along the back wall. “Go ahead and get ready for bed. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Hokuto grabs his toiletry bag and heads for the bathroom. The walls outside are also decorated with framed photos. Hokuto smiles as he passes pictures of a young Taiga in silly poses, laughing and surrounded by friends. He seems so carefree and energetic.</p><p>It’s amazing how one childhood incident would change how one sees themselves for the rest of their life.</p><p>Hokuto sighs, knowing he shouldn’t care so much. He heads inside the bathroom to get ready for bed.</p><p>When he steps out of the bathroom dressed in his pajamas, and makes his way down the hall back to Taiga’s bedroom, Hiromi appears around the corner.</p><p>“Oh, Hokuto, I’m so glad I caught you,” she says brightly. “I wanted to show you something.”</p><p>She holds up a flowing, ivory-colored dress decorated with painted pale pink cherry blossoms along the bodice and hem. Hokuto’s eyes widen in recognition.</p><p>“This was the dress I made and Taiga painted for our high school project, wasn’t it?”</p><p>Hiromi beams. “That’s right! I knew you’d remember. Taiga’s artwork was so lovely, I couldn’t bear to part with this dress. It’s been tucked away in the attic all these years.” She runs a hand admiringly over the fabric. “You two worked so well together on this. I recall Taiga saying you hardly spoke to each other the whole time but had this silent understanding.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, remembering their quiet collaboration. At the time, he never imagined that silent boy would become his fake boyfriend years later.</p><p>“I heard from my husband that you’re the reason Taiga has started painting again,” Hiromi continues. “I wanted to thank you for bringing that creative side back out in him.”</p><p>“Oh, I merely made a suggestion,” Hokuto demurs, his cheeks flushing. “Taiga is incredibly talented. He deserves the credit for deciding to rediscover his passion.”</p><p>“Even so, you’ve been so good for him,” Hiromi insists. “To be honest, I’ve worried about Taiga ever since … well, his latest breakup. He became so closed off after that, just like when he was in grade school.”</p><p>Hokuto remembers — the parent accusing Taiga’s teacher of favoritism because Taiga was an exceptionally cute kid, and Taiga’s eventual preference of fading into the background.</p><p>“But lately, I’m starting to see pieces of the creative, expressive boy I remember,” Hiromi continues wistfully. “All thanks to you, it seems.” She fixes Hokuto with a grateful, hopeful expression. “Promise me you’ll keep bringing out the best in my son.”</p><p>Hokuto’s throat tightens. He knows this relationship is temporary, but he can’t bring himself to shatter the fragile joy in Hiromi’s eyes. “I promise to always encourage Taiga to be his true self,” he says carefully. It’s not the full truth, yet the only answer he can honestly give.</p><p>Hiromi clasps Hokuto’s hand, missing his inner turmoil. “Thank you. I’m so glad Taiga has you now.” With a last fond pat, she heads off down the hall.</p><p>Alone again, Hokuto feels an uncomfortable weight in his chest. Getting close to Taiga was complicated enough, but now his family has embraced Hokuto so warmly, so hopefully.</p><p>He steps into the bedroom to find Taiga scrolling through his phone. An awkward silence falls as they both become aware of the elephant in the room — having to share a bed.</p><p>Hokuto clears his throat. “So, um … how do you normally sleep?” he asks, trying to sound casual.</p><p>Taiga looks up, seeming equally uneasy. “Oh, I’m a side sleeper, usually. I toss and turn a lot less than I used to, at least.” He gives a self-conscious little laugh.</p><p>“I see, I see.” Hokuto nods. “Well, fair warning, I tend to move around quite a bit during the night. So I apologize in advance if I disturb you.”</p><p>“No worries, I’m a pretty heavy sleeper,” Taiga assures him. A beat passes before he adds, “Do you have a side preference?”</p><p>“No, I’m fine on either side.”</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll take the left tonight.” Taiga grabs his toiletry bag and pajamas and heads for the bathroom.</p><p>Once alone, Hokuto takes the right side of the bed. It’s weird how their fake relationship flowed so naturally, but why does it seem so complicated now? Is it just the added intimacy of sharing a bed?</p><p>Taiga returns and they both gingerly get under the covers on their respective sides, keeping a careful distance between them. Taiga turns off the bedside lamp, immersing the room in shadowy darkness.</p><p>“Good night, Hokuto,” Taiga says softly.</p><p>“Good night, Taiga,” Hokuto echoes, staring up at the ceiling. He listens as Taiga’s breathing gradually slows into the steady rhythm of sleep.</p><p>The darkness envelops the room, and Hokuto finds himself unable to sleep. His mind races, replaying the events of the past few days, the conversations, and the unspoken emotions that linger just beneath the surface. He tosses and turns, his restlessness a stark contrast to Taiga’s steady breathing.</p><p>After what feels like hours of fruitless tossing and turning, Hokuto ends up facing Taiga’s side of the bed. It just so happens that Taiga’s sleeping figure is facing him.</p><p>In the dim moonlight, he takes in Taiga’s features relaxed in slumber, lips parted slightly. Hokuto’s breath catches at how beautiful Taiga looks. He always has been, but Hokuto never got to appreciate it up close, even when he’s doing Taiga’s makeup. But now …</p><p>Without thinking, Hokuto’s hand reaches out, drawn to the softness of Taiga’s cheek. But he stops midway, his heart pounding against his ribcage. The realization of what he’s about to do — the intimacy of the gesture — jolts him back to reality.</p><p>What is he thinking? This whole setup is supposed to be an act.</p><p>Shaken, Hokuto quickly shifts to face the other direction. But sleep continues to elude him as his conflicted heart wars within.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>In the golden glow of the sunset-themed outdoor wedding, where hues of pink, orange, and yellow create a picturesque backdrop, Taiga and Hokuto, along with Shintaro and Alice, arrive at their high school classmate’s wedding. The air is vibrant with the excitement of new beginnings and the joy of reunion.</p><p>Taiga blinks rapidly as he and Hokuto walk hand in hand to the festively adorned venue, adjusting to the unfamiliar sensation of contact lenses instead of his usual glasses.</p><p>Hokuto notices his discomfort. “You know, you could always wear your glasses. They’re a part of your charm,” he teases lightly with a playful smirk.</p><p>Taiga chuckles softly. “I’ve managed to put them on, so I might as well commit to the look,” he replies.</p><p>The atmosphere is abuzz with festive energy as they greet their former classmates. The reactions to Taiga and Hokuto's relationship are a mix of surprise and excitement.</p><p>“You two look great together!” one of them exclaims, their enthusiasm genuine.</p><p>“Who would have thought, back in high school, eh?” adds another, their smile warm and friendly.</p><p>As they mingle, Taiga catches a glimpse of Juri on the far side of the room. Juri is engaged in conversation, his warm, gentle demeanor evident even from a distance. Feeling a subtle surge of possessiveness, Taiga instinctively moves closer to Hokuto, his actions seemingly casual yet intentional.</p><p>Hokuto wraps an arm around Taiga's shoulder. “You’re doing quite well as a pretend boyfriend,” he whispers, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p>Taiga nods, pushing down the pang of jealousy he feels. He knows Hokuto is just pretending to be with him to make Juri jealous. Still, seeing the person Hokuto actually wants stings.</p><p>“Kyomoto, you look great!” one of their classmates exclaims as they sit down. “I hardly recognized you without your glasses.”</p><p>“The contacts are new,” Taiga explains with an embarrassed smile.</p><p>“I think they suit you,” Alice adds warmly. “You both look very sharp today.”</p><p>Taiga thanks her, sneaking a glance at Hokuto. He does look exceptionally handsome in his tailored suit, Taiga thinks.</p><p>The ceremony begins shortly after. Taiga tries to focus on the vows, but he can’t stop himself from staring at Hokuto’s profile, admiring how the setting sun lights up his features. Hokuto catches his gaze and smiles back softly. For a moment, everything else fades away, and it feels like it’s just the two of them.</p><p>After the ceremony ends, they mingle with other guests at the reception. Some are former high school classmates, who want the scoop on their relationship. Taiga blushes but leans into the act, clinging to Hokuto’s arm possessively as Hokuto does the talking.</p><p>As the night at the outdoor wedding deepens, the music shifts to a slower, more intimate rhythm, inviting couples to the dance floor under the soft glow of sunset-themed lights. Couples begin drifting to the dance floor, swaying in each other’s arms.</p><p>Taiga notices Hokuto glancing forlornly across the room at Juri, who seems engrossed in conversation with another wedding guest. In a bid to distract both Hokuto and himself from the tinge of jealousy, Taiga gently touches Hokuto's arm. “Would you like to dance with me?” he asks.</p><p>Hokuto looks surprised but smiles gently. “I’d love to,” he says, taking Taiga's hand and leading him to the dance floor. Taiga's heart flutters as Hokuto’s arms wraps around his waist.</p><p>As they slow dance, Taiga gazes up at Hokuto, admiring how handsome he looks in the soft lighting. But he can’t help but notice Hokuto’s occasional glances towards Juri either. “You seem distracted,” he says hesitantly. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>Hokuto sighs. “I guess I’m just frustrated with how things are going with Juri,” he admits. “I’d hoped to make more progress by now.” He pauses, as if he wants to say more, but then decides against it.</p><p>Taiga’s heart sinks, but he forces a smile. Feeling a sudden surge of boldness, he presses on. “Well, we’re here together. Maybe we can give him something to think about.”</p><p>Hokuto opens his mouth as if to say something, then seems to reconsider. After a moment, he asks gently, “What do you think we should do?”</p><p>Emboldened, Taiga says, “This is your chance to remind Juri of what he’s missing. You’re so thoughtful, patient and wise. Not to mention incredibly talented and handsome.” He blushes, realizing he revealed more real feelings than intended.</p><p>Hokuto looks touched. “Taiga, I … Thank you …” He trails off, conflicted. Then a mischievous glint enters his eyes. “I have a crazy idea, but you can say no.”</p><p>“What is it?” Taiga asks, intrigued.</p><p>“We could, maybe, possibly … kiss?” Hokuto suggests tentatively. “But only if you’re comfortable with it!” he adds quickly.</p><p>Taiga’s stomach flutters nervously. He knows kissing Hokuto is playing with fire, a mere play for Juri’s attention, but the temptation to be close to him overwhelms his doubts. “Okay,” he breathes out. “Let’s do it.”</p><p>Hokuto looks surprised but pleased. Taiga scans the room and spots Juri still chatting nearby. Taking a deep breath, he turns and positions themselves subtly within Juri’s view and pulls Hokuto close. Hokuto’s eyes widen slightly before he relaxes into Taiga’s embrace.</p><p>Their faces inch closer, then their lips meet. For a moment, the world fades away.</p><p>Taiga’s heart races uncontrollably. Hokuto's lips are soft and warm against his own. In this moment, nothing else matters but the feeling of Hokuto in his arms. Taiga pours all his secret longing into the kiss. For these few seconds, Hokuto is really his.</p><p>In the background, Shintaro’s whoop of excitement pierces the moment, but Taiga is too lost in the sensation, the rightness of the kiss, to care.</p><p>Too soon, they gently pull apart. Taiga steals a glance at Juri and notices his chair is empty. His stomach drops, but he forces a smile. “He’s gone,” he tells Hokuto.</p><p>“It was worth a shot,” Hokuto says, but his eyes don’t match his casual tone. He pulls Taiga close again, enveloping him in a warm hug. “Thank you for doing that for me,” he murmurs. “It means a lot that I can rely on you.”</p><p>Taiga clings to Hokuto, wishing the night would never end. Over Hokuto’s shoulder, he notices Shintaro grinning at them excitedly and giving a thumbs up. Taiga smiles ruefully. If only Shintaro knew the truth.</p><p>For now, Taiga pushes that thought away, losing himself in the feel of Hokuto's strong arms around him. He lays his head on Hokuto’s shoulder as they continue to sway to the music, neither wanting this moment between them to end.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As Taiga chats with an old high school friend, Hokuto politely excuses himself. “I’m just going to run to the restroom quickly,” he says, squeezing Taiga’s hand before walking away.</p><p>But instead of the restroom, Hokuto wanders toward the garden, eyes searching for that familiar slender frame. He finds Juri sitting alone on a stone bench beneath a willow tree, looking pensively out at the city lights.</p><p>Hokuto approaches slowly. “Mind if I join you?”</p><p>Juri glances up, surprise flickering over his delicate features before his expression turns impassive. “Shouldn’t you be with your boyfriend?” he asks coolly.</p><p>“Taiga knows I stepped out for a bit,” Hokuto lies with an easy smile. He sits down, leaving a careful distance between them on the bench.</p><p>Neither speaks for a long moment, the awkwardness hanging heavy in the air. Hokuto sneaks a sidelong glance at Juri, taking in the furrow between his brows that means he’s turning over careful thoughts.</p><p>Finally Juri breaks the tense silence. “Seeing you and Kyomoto together on the dance floor earlier … it hurt more than I expected,” he admits quietly.</p><p>Hokuto’s heart quickens, knowing this confession is exactly the reaction he wanted to evoke in Juri. But instead of satisfaction, an uneasy guilt churns inside him.</p><p>“I spent the past few months telling myself I was over you, that I didn’t care who you dated,” Juri continues, still not looking at Hokuto. “But I guess a part of me hoped we might reconnect someday.” He finally meets Hokuto’s gaze. “If I could do it again, I would have fought harder for you, for us.” Juri’s dark eyes shine with regret.</p><p>Hokuto opens his mouth but no words come out. This is the moment he plotted and schemed for, Juri declaring he wants Hokuto back. Hokuto should be erupting with victory and vindication.</p><p>But all he feels is a hollow sadness settling upon him.</p><p>Juri seems to take Hokuto's speechlessness as rejection. He rises gracefully from the bench. “I won’t interfere, I promise. I wish you and Kyomoto every happiness together.”</p><p>With quiet dignity, Juri walks away and disappears into the shadows of the trees, leaving Hokuto alone with his swirling thoughts.</p><p>Hokuto came here tonight hoping to rekindle Juri’s affections through jealousy. He expected that winning Juri back would feel like sweet redemption after their painful breakup.</p><p>Instead, he finds himself conflicted, wondering if his lingering feelings for Juri are even real anymore. Especially when a pair of soulful eyes behind glasses keep creeping into his thoughts instead.</p><p>But Hokuto initiated this whole fake relationship with the intent of making Juri jealous and getting him back. Can he really just abandon that long-held plan?</p><p>Dropping his head into his hands, Hokuto knows only one thing for certain — rather than providing answers, tonight has left him more lost and confused than ever.</p><p>It’s past midnight by the time Hokuto and Taiga return to the Kyomoto house, both exhausted from the wedding festivities. As they enter the serene, earthy tones of the living room, Hokuto considers telling Taiga about his encounter with Juri. About Juri regretting their breakup and wanting Hokuto back.</p><p>He knows that was their agreement — get Juri jealous so Hokuto could rekindle things with his ex. This pretend relationship was supposed to end once Hokuto achieved that goal.</p><p>But the words stick in his throat. Because ending this charade would mean losing Taiga, and Hokuto finds himself unwilling to let that happen.</p><p>“I’m going to get changed,” Hokuto says instead, heading for the bedroom to get his toiletry kit and pajamas.</p><p>When he returns in pajamas, Taiga is sitting on the edge of the bed, struggling to remove his contact lenses. Hokuto watches in amusement as Taiga’s frustration grows.</p><p>“Here, let me help,” Hokuto offers gently.</p><p>He teaches Taiga the proper way to remove the lenses, letting Taiga blink in relief. One sticky lens remains stuck to Taiga’s cheek. Hokuto brushes it away tenderly with his thumb, letting his hand linger there.</p><p>Taiga meets his gaze, eyes wide. Hokuto finds himself drowning in those dark, soulful depths. Unthinking, he begins to lean in, drawn like a magnet to Taiga’s parted lips.</p><p>But Taiga pulls back abruptly. “We shouldn’t …” he whispers.</p><p>Hokuto frowns in confusion and hurt.</p><p>Taiga won’t meet his eyes. “I accidentally overheard you and Tanaka in the garden,” he admits softly. “Congrats, you got him to regret the breakup. So you don’t need to keep pretending with me.” He forces a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Our contract is done. You’re free now.” His laugh is strained and hollow.</p><p>Hokuto opens his mouth but no words form. He wants to tell Taiga this means nothing, that he realizes it now.</p><p>He chooses Taiga. Only Taiga.</p><p>But paralyzed by turmoil, Hokuto merely stays silent.</p><p>Mistaking his speechlessness, Taiga stands quickly. “I better get changed too. Good night, Hokuto.” He disappears into the bathroom before Hokuto can react.</p><p>Hokuto sits there stunned, realizing what just happened.</p><p>What he allowed to happen.</p><p>In staying quiet, he let Taiga believe their fake relationship was over, that Hokuto was cutting ties. That pained look in Taiga's eyes pierces Hokuto’s heart.</p><p>Because even if it started off an act, his feelings for Taiga now are real and deep. And the thought of losing Taiga — his smile, his passion, the depths of his soul — is unbearable.</p><p>But in his confusion and hesitation, Hokuto already pushed him away.</p><p>As the reality sinks in, a profound ache of regret settles upon Hokuto. He let his chance at real happiness slip through his fingers.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga sits at his desk, bleary-eyed as he halfheartedly flips through a stack of papers. His takeout dinner lies untouched, the food long since gone cold. He sighs and rubs his eyes beneath his glasses, unable to focus on the task at hand. It’s been two weeks since he and Hokuto ended their fake dating contract, but the heartache still lingers.</p><p>The door to his office bursts open, and Shintaro breezes in, a concerned look on his face. “Working late again, Taiga?” he asks, though his tone implies he already knows the answer.</p><p>Taiga mumbles something noncommittal, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Shintaro glances the file on Taiga’s desk. “Isn’t this the Suzuki divorce case? That’s not for another month.”</p><p>“There’s always more work to do,” Taiga says, his gaze fixed on the document before him.</p><p>Shintaro frowns. “You’re all caught up. Don’t think I haven’t noticed you coming in early and staying late these past couple weeks.” He pauses. “Ever since the wedding.”</p><p>Taiga’s shoulders tense.</p><p>“Did you and Matsumura have a fight?” Shintaro asks gently.</p><p>Taiga doesn’t answer, remembering his last conversation with Hokuto. The moment he overheard Juri talking to Hokuto about regretting the breakup. Hokuto almost kissing him when they were alone in his childhood bedroom. The sinking feeling as Taiga realized their pretend relationship had run its course.</p><p>He says nothing but understanding dawns on Shintaro’s face.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Taiga,” Shintaro says, placing a comforting hand on his friend’s shoulder. “I know this can’t be easy.”</p><p>Taiga just nods, the lingering heartache evident in his pained expression.</p><p>“Do I need to go beat some sense into him?” Shintaro asks, his tone hardening slightly as a protective glint enters his eyes.</p><p>Despite his melancholy, Taiga can’t help but smile faintly at the offer. “No, don’t. It’s not his fault.”</p><p>Shintaro sighs. “Well, if you need someone to talk to, I’m here. But you can’t keep working yourself to exhaustion like this. It won’t change anything.”</p><p>Taiga nods reluctantly, knowing his friend is right but unsure how else to cope with the hollow ache in his chest. He tried painting, but all he remembers is how Hokuto encouraging him to pick up that hobby again.</p><p>“Come on,” Shintaro says, pulling Taiga up. “We’re getting out of here.”</p><p>Taiga blinks in surprise. “What?”</p><p>“You need a break. We’re going for drinks. My treat.” Shintaro has his phone out. “I’m bringing Yugo and Jesse along, too. This is an intervention.”</p><p>“Shintaro, I don’t know …” Taiga protests halfheartedly.</p><p>“Doctor’s orders,” Shintaro cuts him off with a gentle smile. He helps Taiga into his coat and practically frog-marches him out the door.</p><p>Taiga and Shintaro arrive at the lively <em>izakaya</em>, immediately spotting Yugo and Jesse waving at them from a corner booth. Shintaro orders a round of drinks, making sure to get Taiga’s favorite beer.</p><p>“You’re looking rough, Taiga,” Jesse says, his voice warm with concern. “Bad day at the office?”</p><p>Taiga just shrugs, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>“It’s a good thing you’re not an accountant,” Jesse says with a grin. “Otherwise, you’d be stressed assets!”</p><p>Despite himself, Taiga cracks a smile. “Oh my god, that was awful!” he remarks. Jesse always knows how to lighten the mood.</p><p>Yugo gives Taiga’s arm a gentle, reassuring squeeze but doesn’t speak. He hands Taiga the menu, encouraging him to order as much as he likes.</p><p>As the night goes on and the drinks flow, Taiga decides to finally come clean about him and Hokuto.</p><p>“Hokuto and I were never actually dating,” he admits quietly as he finishes his nth glass of beer. “We were on a fake dating contract. He wanted to make his ex jealous, and I wanted to make it look like I’ve moved on from Jesse. Which”—He glances at Jesse—“I <em>have</em> moved on, just to be clear.”</p><p>His friends’ eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>“But somewhere in between, I fell hard. I wanted it to be real. But then at the wedding, I heard Tanaka telling Hokuto that he regretted the breakup, and that was the end of our contract. But it hurts. It hurts a lot.”</p><p>“Did you talk to Matsumura about it?” Shintaro asks.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, tears shimmering in his eyes. “I broke it off. I know he still wants to be with Tanaka.”</p><p>Yugo frowns thoughtfully. “But are you sure? Maybe you should tell him how you feel.”</p><p>“He doesn’t feel the same way,” Taiga says miserably. “We kissed … but it didn’t mean anything.”</p><p>Even as he says it, he remembers their kiss as they slow-danced at the wedding. The way Hokuto’s eyes lingered on his lips that night in his childhood bedroom.</p><p>Jesse places a supportive hand on Taiga’s shoulder. “Take it from me, you’ve changed so much for the better since you started ‘dating’ him. You’re stepping out of your comfort zone. Heck, you’re painting again! You’re happy around him, and I think you owe it to yourself to tell Hokuto the truth.”</p><p>Taiga stares down at his beer, the chatter of the izakaya fading into background noise. He knows his friends mean well, but the thought of confessing his feelings to Hokuto makes his stomach churn with anxiety.</p><p>What if he pours his heart out and Hokuto just gives him that calm, composed look he always has? That quiet rejection might hurt more than never knowing at all.</p><p>He takes a long sip of beer, letting the bitter taste sit on his tongue. After ending their pretend relationship, he’d spent every day thinking about Hokuto. Remembering the warmth of Hokuto’s hand in his, the thrill of Hokuto’s intense gaze focused solely on him, the electricity sparking between them in unguarded moments.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head sharply, as if to dislodge the memories. <em>Stop it.</em> Those moments weren’t real. Hokuto made that clear when he didn’t stop Taiga from ending their ruse.</p><p>“It’s okay to be unsure,” Yugo says, wrapping an arm around Taiga’s shoulders. “This is your decision.”</p><p>Jesse nods. “We just want you to be happy, Taiga. Whatever you decide.”</p><p>Taiga smiles weakly. He knows they’re right — living with the regret of never knowing for sure would eat away at him. Terrifying as it is, he has to tell Hokuto the truth.</p><p>“I’ll do it,” he says softly. “I’ll talk to him.”</p><p>Shintaro grins and claps Taiga on the back. “That’s our Taiga. You’ve got this.”</p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath, steadying his nerves.</p><p>He can be brave.</p><p>He got this.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto clicks off the TV, unable to focus on the makeover show as his thoughts inevitably drift back to Taiga again. He misses Taiga’s animated reactions and commentary whenever they used to watch these programs together. Hokuto’s chest aches, feeling Taiga’s absence like a raw, open wound.</p><p>It’s been two weeks since the wedding and subsequent “break-up.” Two weeks since Hokuto has left his apartment or talked to anyone besides brief, worried texts from Alice and Daigo checking in on him. Two weeks since he rescheduled all client consultations and event appearances, making up some excuse that he’s sick.</p><p>Juri also messaged asking if they could meet up and talk, apologizing for bring up old wounds at the wedding. But Hokuto has ignored all communication, wallowing alone in his self-imposed isolation.</p><p>The sound of the front door opening shakes Hokuto from his brooding. He looks over in surprise as Alice and Daigo enter his living room, staring at him in concern.</p><p>“Okay, enough is enough, you need to stop moping around by yourself,” Alice declares, arms crossed as she fixes Hokuto with her no-nonsense gaze.</p><p>Hokuto sighs, waving them toward the couch. “I know … I just haven’t felt up to seeing anyone I guess.” Then, he blinks. “Wait, how did you guys get in?” he adds, suddenly realizing he didn’t let them inside.</p><p>“Oh, I used my spare key,” Alice says casually, holding the key ring up with a jingle before pocketing it again. Her sharp gaze surveys Hokuto critically. “You look absolutely terrible, by the way.”</p><p>Hokuto runs a hand through his unwashed hair with a grimace. “Tell me something I don’t know,” he responds wryly.</p><p>Alice just sniffs and smooths a wrinkle from her sleeve as she takes a seat. Daigo gives Hokuto a sympathetic quirk of his lips before sitting beside her.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about what happened with Taiga?” Alice asks, fixing Hokuto with her piercing intuitive stare once more.</p><p>“It’s stupid, my plan went perfectly,” Hokuto says bitterly. “Juri admitted he regretted our breakup. And Taiga overheard the conversation and says our fake contract was finished. But for some reason it hurts anyway, and I don’t know why.”</p><p>It’s a lie; Hokuto does know why it hurts. Over those five months of pretending to date, he’d started falling for Taiga - for his passion, his quirks, the way he balanced out Hokuto’s cool practicality with his emotional warmth. Hokuto misses Taiga’s witty commentary, his companionship, even just catching the sparkle behind his glasses across the room.</p><p>Hokuto remembers with a renewed ache that pained look in Taiga’s eyes after the wedding, when Taiga said their contract was done and he didn’t need to pretend with Hokuto anymore. How Taiga wished Hokuto happiness with Juri again before walking away.</p><p>Just the memory sends a piercing pain through Hokuto’s chest, compounding the hurt that's plagued him these lonely two weeks.</p><p>Alice considers this. “Maybe after five months of pretending to be a couple, you’d actually developed real feelings for Taiga. Even if getting Juri back was the initial goal.”</p><p>Daigo nods understandingly. “Feelings can be illogical and messy — maybe you’re also confused why you didn’t feel closure even after Juri confessed regret.”</p><p>Hokuto drops his head in his hands. “You’re probably right … I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do now.”</p><p>“You need to figure out if you still have genuine feelings for Juri versus unresolved emotional issues,” Daigo points out reasonably. “Then determine what you truly want relationship-wise moving forward.”</p><p>“We’ll support you either way, but for now just focus on taking care of yourself first,” Alice says, her voice kind beneath the no-nonsense tone.</p><p>Some of the heavy sadness in Hokuto’s chest lifts at his friends’ steadfast loyalty. Impulsively, he pulls them both into a fierce, grateful hug. With their compassionate support, perhaps he can begin sorting through the messy tangle of his conflicted heart.</p><p>After Alice orders some takeout for delivery, the three of them chat over dinner. Hokuto feels himself relaxing, the oppressive loneliness of the past weeks finally dissipating.</p><p>Once his friends have left, Hokuto draws himself a soothing bath, taking care to treat his neglected skin to proper cleansing and moisturizing. The familiar self-care rituals ground him, making him feel more like his old self again.</p><p>Feeling renewed determination to stop hiding away, Hokuto sends apologetic messages to his clients asking about rescheduling their missed consultations. Then he steels himself to open Juri’s string of unread texts.</p><p>Juri’s most recent one from two days ago reads: <em>Can we talk? I really think it would help give us both closure. Let me know a time that works for you</em>.</p><p>Hokuto takes a deep breath and types back: <em>How about tomorrow afternoon at the café by the station? Around 3pm?</em></p><p>He hits send before he can overthink it. If he wants to move forward, Hokuto knows he needs to sort through his remaining feelings regarding Juri first.</p><p>Hokuto’s phone buzzes with a new email. He opens it to see photos from their recently married high school classmate, thanking Hokuto again for attending.</p><p>Hokuto scrolls through candid shots of the ceremony and reception. He pauses on one from the dance floor — Hokuto and Taiga locked in that passionate fake kiss intended to make Juri jealous.</p><p>Seeing photographic evidence of the intimacy they once shared, even artificially, sends an unexpected pang through Hokuto. He wonders how Taiga has been holding up these past couple weeks. But checking Taiga’s social media only shows his last posts are from the same day as the wedding.</p><p>Hokuto’s traitorous heart dares to hope that maybe, just maybe, Taiga had developed real feelings too during their pretend relationship. But Hokuto quickly shuts down that dangerous line of wishful thinking for now.</p><p>Overanalyzing will get him nowhere. He needs to take things one step at a time, starting with meeting Juri tomorrow.</p><p>Hokuto turns off the bedside lamp and wills his restless mind to sleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga wakes feeling as if he barely slept, the now-familiar hollow ache settling into his chest before he’s even fully conscious. Going through the motions, he drags himself out of bed to reheat a serving of the casserole Yugo dropped off yesterday. His friend had gently insisted Taiga needed to keep eating, no matter his low appetite lately.</p><p>While the casserole is warming, Taiga checks his phone. An email from his recently married classmate has photos attached from the wedding. Taiga scrolls through candid ceremony and reception shots before stopping short at one image — Hokuto and Taiga in their kiss on the dancefloor. Anyone would have mistaken it as a romantic gesture, but it was an act — a successful one at that.</p><p>The memory of Hokuto’s lips on his comes rushing back, sparking an intense bittersweet pang. In that dazzling, endless moment, with Hokuto’s arms around him, Taiga had felt truly cherished. He would give anything to go back, to turn that pretend display of affection into something real between them.</p><p>But the pretense is over. Hokuto was probably just doing a consummate acting job anyway, Taiga reminds himself harshly even as his thumb caresses Hokuto’s face on the screen.</p><p>On impulse, Taiga opens Hokuto’s Instagram, half-dreading and half-hopeful for a sign Hokuto misses him, too. But Hokuto's latest Story shows him serenely going through his skincare routine earlier this morning. He looks unfairly gorgeous as always … and completely unaffected.</p><p>Taiga’s fragile hope crumbles. Hokuto has likely already reunited happily with Juri by now. After all, ending his fake relationship was Hokuto’s goal all along. Why would he spare Taiga another thought?</p><p>Dropping the phone with a clatter, Taiga wraps arms tight around his midsection, feeling like he might split apart from the raging storm within his heart. But he forces down the tears burning behind his eyes. He has no right to fall apart when he agreed to assist with Hokuto’s plan in the first place. Even if Taiga eventually wished their contracted relationship was real instead.</p><p>Gulping back the lump in his throat, Taiga attempts to divert his attention by sitting at his drawing desk. Hokuto once suggested art helps Taiga process emotions, and Taiga is desperate not to dwell on could-have-beens right now.</p><p>Hunching over his sketchpad, Taiga loses himself in broad pencil strokes, textures and shapes emerging into a lonely figure sitting curled up atop a stone wall, looking out pensively at the distant sunset.</p><p>After what feels like hours, Taiga leans back to survey his rough but unexpectedly poignant sketch. Art does clarify his conflicted feelings, cutting through confusing layers to capture bittersweet essence.</p><p>Glancing at the clock, Taiga is shocked to see it's nearly 4pm. The morning completely disappeared in his artistic haze. No wonder his stomach is growling.</p><p>Taiga wanders to the kitchen in search of a meal, wondering if he should text Yugo a proper thank you for the casserole. As he rummages through leftovers, Taiga considers reaching out to Jesse, too; his ex always had a soothing way of helping Taiga gain perspective whenever he felt emotionally overwhelmed.</p><p>But the thought of revisiting hurt over love lost, even with Jesse’s gentle wisdom, feels too raw right now.</p><p>Blinking back another onset of tears, Taiga abandons the idea of eating leftovers. He decides some fresh air would do him good — both emotionally and appetite-wise.</p><p>Grabbing a light jacket against the spring breezes, Taiga heads out the door to find someplace to eat. Focusing on placing one foot in front of the other, he redirects his attention outside himself, taking in the greening trees and chattering pedestrians lining the sidewalk.</p><p>If he tries hard enough, Taiga can almost immerse his heavy heart into the current of simple daily life around him. Almost.</p><p>Taiga decides on a cozy café near the corner, remembering that it served one of his favorite tomato dishes. Craving the nostalgic comfort food, he hurries across the street toward the café entrance.</p><p>But just as he reaches to pull open the door, Taiga catches sight of two familiar figures stepping outside — Hokuto and Juri.</p><p>Taiga freezes, half-hidden behind the menu board as he watches the pair standing close together, speaking intently.</p><p>Juri says something that makes Hokuto break eye contact, looking conflicted. When Hokuto doesn’t respond, Juri gently tilts Hokuto’s chin up and leans in closer.</p><p>Taiga feels his chest seize in agony. Are they about to kiss? Making up now that Hokuto ended things with Taiga? Like a fresh stab to his already ravaged heart.</p><p>He shifts to escape before he does something embarrassing like burst into tears. But in his haste, he collides heavily with a passerby.</p><p>Taiga loses grip on his phone and watches in helpless slow motion as it clatters loudly across the pavement, making Hokuto and Juri look over in surprise.</p><p>Humiliated fury wells up in Taiga as he locks eyes with Hokuto. Making a snap decision, Taiga turns on his heel and immediately flees the scene. Hokuto calls after him but Taiga only walks faster, half-running in his desperation to get away, to hide from the pain threatening to swallow him whole.</p><p>He makes it back to his apartment in record time, chest heaving, and throws himself facedown on the couch. Only then does Taiga let the sobs he’s been choking back for weeks finally tear free. He muffles the broken sounds in a throw pillow, body shaking violently with the force of his anguish.</p><p>Seeing proof that Hokuto has already moved on, likely back together with Juri, bludgeoned that final fragile hope still clinging inside Taiga — the pathetic wish that their fake connection might lead to real love blooming.</p><p>Instead he nothing but a discarded stepping stone on Hokuto’s predestined path back toward Juri.</p><p>And the stark truth of it shreds Taiga’s heart to ribbons.</p>

<p align="center">🖤</p><p>The gentle chimes of the café door alert Hokuto to Juri’s arrival. He looks up from his coffee, his stomach doing an odd little flip at seeing Juri again after so long.</p><p>“Hey,” Juri greets him simply as he sheds his jacket and takes a seat across from Hokuto.</p><p>“Hello,” Hokuto returns calmly. Inside, his nerves are buzzing, but he maintains his usual composure.</p><p>Juri orders an espresso from the server before glancing back at Hokuto. “Thanks for agreeing to meet,” he says somewhat awkwardly.</p><p>Hokuto nods.</p><p>An uncomfortable silence falls as they wait for Juri’s drink to arrive. Hokuto’s eyes scan the cozy interior, taking in the charming woods and brass accents. Anything to avoid meeting Juri’s gaze and exposing the tremors in his composure.</p><p>Juri clears his throat as his espresso arrives. “So … you’ve been quiet on social media since the wedding. Is everything alright?”</p><p>“Yes, just keeping busy with work.” Hokuto gazes down at his coffee. “And … Taiga overheard our conversation at the wedding. We, uh, haven’t spoken since.”</p><p>Juri winces. “I’m sorry about that. I didn’t mean for things to get awkward between you two.”</p><p>Hokuto sighs softly. “It’s not your fault. I dated Taiga hoping to stir your jealousy, if I’m being honest. But along the way …”</p><p>He trails off, remembering hazy moments dancing under golden lights, the way Taiga’s shy smile made his heart feel too big for his chest. Things he’s only just begun to acknowledge himself.</p><p>Juri is watching him quietly, the set of his mouth grim yet understanding. “You developed genuine feelings for him.”</p><p>Hokuto nods once. “I did. I realize now I should have been upfront about that from the start, with both of you.”</p><p>“I appreciate you being honest now,” Juri murmurs. He toys with his coffee cup, averting his gaze. “I know I hurt you when we broke up, and I’ll regret that forever. All I wanted was to fix things between us.”</p><p>“I know.” Hokuto exhales softly. “And part of me still cares for you deeply. But I can’t deny my heart anymore. It wants Taiga.”</p><p>Juri nods, sadness etched into his features. Yet beneath it lies a glimmer of acceptance. “I understand. For what it’s worth, I hope you two work things out.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles faintly. “Thank you.”</p><p>Their conversation lapses into a comfortable silence as Juri finishes his coffee. The easy truce between them feels bittersweet yet relieving.</p><p>Hokuto is grateful for the closure.</p><p>After finishing their drinks and paying the bill, they step out of the cozy café. From his peripheral vision, Hokuto notices Taiga movement behind the menu board outside the establishment.</p><p>However, Juri clears his throat, and Hokuto turns his attention back to him.</p><p>“I hope we can continue rebuilding our friendship,” Juri says. “There’s still a bond between us worth preserving.” When Hokuto doesn't respond right away, processing the bittersweet emotions, Juri tilts Hokuto’s chin up gently with his fingers. “Thank you for hearing me out.”</p><p>Before Hokuto can reply, a loud clattering sounds from outside.</p><p>Hokuto jumps and looks over, his wide eyes locking with Taiga’s equally wide ones. He can see the emotions in Taiga’s eyes — humiliation from being found eavesdropping, the hurt.</p><p>Then, Taiga is already turning away, fleeing down the street at a near run.</p><p>“Taiga, wait!” Hokuto calls out instinctively, forcing the door of the café open, taking off after him without a second thought. He needs to explain, to make Taiga understand it isn’t what it seems.</p><p>But Taiga moves swiftly, rounding the corner and disappearing into the crowds before Hokuto can catch up. He curses under his breath, frantically pulling out his phone to message Taiga. Only then does he realize Taiga has left his phone behind in his distress.</p><p>Dejected, Hokuto sighs and turns back to pick up the abandoned phone. Stuffing it in his bag, he turns and begins jogging in the direction Taiga had fled.</p><p>Finally, he arrives at the apartment building. Hokuto’s nerves alight with equal parts anxiety and determination as he strides to Taiga’s front door. He rings the doorbell, and while he doesn’t get a response, he hears sobbing from inside.</p><p>“Taiga, please let me explain,” Hokuto calls gently.</p><p>No response.</p><p>“I have your phone. Can I at least give it back to you? But I would really appreciate it if you can hear me out.”</p><p>Silence. Then, with a quiet snick, the lock turns and the door opens a crack. Taiga peeks out, his expression guarded yet exhausted.</p><p>Hokuto holds up the phone in offering. “I thought you might need this.” As Taiga takes it without meeting his eyes, Hokuto continues. “Please, five minutes of your time. If you still want me to leave after, I’ll go.”</p><p>Taiga’s lips press into a thin line, but he steps aside wordlessly. Hokuto enters, noting the worn appearance of Taiga’s living room. Clearly, the past two weeks have been hard on him, too.</p><p>They sit on opposite sides of the couch, waiting for the other to speak first. Hokuto decides to break the tense silence. “What you saw at the café earlier … it wasn’t real. Juri and I were just chatting, and we sought closure. We’ll just be friends.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes widen. “I thought … you wanted him back,” he says quietly, his thumb rubbing idle circles on his phone case. Surprise crosses his features. “I thought that’s what you wanted this whole time with our fake relationship.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, keeping his movements gentle and unthreatening. “At first, yes. But along the way … spending time with you opened my eyes. I realized the one I cared for most was you.”</p><p>Taiga swallows, avoiding Hokuto’s earnest gaze. “So you just used me.”</p><p>“No.” Hokuto shakes his head firmly. “What started as acting became so much more to me. These past five months, I fell for you, Taiga.”</p><p>Taiga gives a watery laugh. “Funny way of showing it after the wedding, not even stopping me when I said we should end things.”</p><p>Hokuto frowns pensively. “You’re right, I made mistakes. I should have been upfront from the start that my feelings changed. But I’m trying to make it right now—if you’ll let me.” He reaches tentatively for Taiga’s hand.</p><p>Taiga pulls away at first but then relents, sighing as their fingers interlock. His eyes shine with unshed tears. “It hurt so much thinking you didn’t care beyond our fake dating contract.”</p><p>Hokuto’s heart clenches remorsefully. “I never meant to hurt you. If there’s any way I can make it up to you …”</p><p>A beat passes where they simply sit absorbing each other’s warmth. Hokuto notes the flush bloom across Taiga’s cheeks and knows his face wears a matching blush.</p><p>Taiga’s lips curve upwards shyly. “Kiss me,” he whispers, so softly Hokuto wonders if he imagined it. But the hopeful fragility in Taiga’s eyes confirms his request.</p><p>Hokuto cups Taiga’s cheek, leaning in close enough to feel Taiga’s quickening breath. “Are you sure?” he murmurs.</p><p>At Taiga’s eager nod, Hokuto closes the final distance between them.</p><p>When their lips meet, the whole world seems to exhale in relief. Kissing Taiga — their first <em>real</em> kiss — feels like coming home — like surfacing after being submerged in darkness. Their mouths glide together naturally, full of promise untainted by pretense.</p><p>Hokuto pours every ounce of remorse, devotion, and affection into the kiss, showing Taiga without words how profoundly he’s come to care. Taiga’s arms circle his neck, holding Hokuto close as if to undo the two weeks they’ve lost.</p><p>Reluctantly, they part, panting lightly. Taiga’s eyes remain shut as Hokuto rests their foreheads together. “I never want to lose you again,” Hokuto whispers fiercely.</p><p>“You won’t,” Taiga vows. His glistening lashes flutter open, a shy smile tugging at his blush-stained lips. He reaches to tug his tear-stained glasses off. “You really meant what you said?”</p><p>“I really do,” Hokuto promises lowly, his returning grin feeling watery as he holds Taiga’s shining gaze.</p><p>A watery smile breaks across Taiga’s features. “Then all I’ve wanted is for you to be mine, too,” he confesses in a rush, launching himself into Hokuto’s waiting embrace.</p><p>Hokuto holds Taiga close, his racing heart feeling fit to burst. Lacing his fingers gingerly through Taiga’s soft hair, he tilts Taiga’s chin up, meeting their lips once more in a delicate kiss.</p><p>Through the open window, birdsong drifts on the breeze and sunlight washes over them in a golden glow. A sense of calm and rightness settles in Hokuto’s soul, with Taiga safe and willing in his arms at last.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🩷</p><p>Taiga wakes to the feeling of strong arms wrapped securely around him, breath tickling the back of his neck. For a blissful moment between sleep and full wakefulness, he allows himself to melt into the embrace.</p><p>Then yesterday comes crashing back.</p><p>Seeing Hokuto with Juri outside the café. The pain, the humiliating phone drop, fleeing the scene in tears.</p><p>How is Hokuto here with him now?</p><p>Taiga inhales sharply and tries to shift, to look behind him and confirm this is somehow real and not just wishful dreaming.</p><p>The arms tighten in response, a muffled groan of protest escaping the man curled around him. Hokuto. Taiga feels dizzy at the confirmation, each breath coming fast and shallow. Carefully, he manages to turn himself around to face Hokuto without waking him.</p><p>Hokuto looks beautifully peaceful in sleep, lashes dark against his cheeks, lips parted just so. Taiga aches to touch him, to trace the elegant features he has memorized like a favorite work of art. But he doesn’t dare move, terrified to shatter this fragile moment.</p><p>So Taiga lies still and watches Hokuto sleep, senses flooded with his presence. The minty scent of Hokuto’s body wash, the warmth of his skin beneath the sheets, the steady rhythm of his breathing. Overwhelming evidence that somehow, impossibly, Hokuto is here with him.</p><p>Eventually Hokuto stirs, eyes blinking open slowly. They widen when they meet Taiga’s stunned gaze in return.</p><p>“Hey,” Hokuto rasps, voice still slurred with sleep. He smiles, soft and private.</p><p>“Hey,” Taiga whispers back, uncomprehending.</p><p>Hokuto props himself up on one elbow. Taiga expects that Hokuto would get up, realize this is a mistake, then leave. But instead, Hokuto simply leans in and kisses him sweetly.</p><p>“Good morning.”</p><p>The press of Hokuto’s lips is tender and unhurried. Taiga makes a small sound, still not fully processing this surreal turn of events. But he kisses back instinctively, the slide of Hokuto’s mouth against his own chasing away all questions for now.</p><p>When they gently break apart, Taiga stares up at Hokuto hovering above him. “So … not a dream then?” he asks weakly.</p><p>Hokuto huffs a laugh, rolling them until Taiga is settled atop his chest. “No, not a dream.” His thumb brushes Taiga’s cheek gingerly and smiles up at him, nothing but open adoration in his gaze. “You, Kyomoto Taiga. I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Taiga’s breath leaves him in a rush. The words he has longed to hear but never imagined possible. Overcome, he has to blink back tears.</p><p>Taiga clings to him just as tightly, face buried in Hokuto’s shoulder. “I believe you,” he whispers. “And I’m in love with you too. So much it terrifies me.”</p><p>A relieved sound escapes Hokuto, and he tilts Taiga’s face up to meet his lips again. The kiss starts soft but soon ignites, all their shared longing and passion blazing freely now that the misunderstandings have lifted.</p><p>When Taiga’s stomach rumbles audibly, effectively ruining the mood, they collapse into breathless giggles.</p><p>“Guess I’d better feed you,” Hokuto teases. He presses a smacking kiss to Taiga’s cheek before gracefully rising from the bed.</p><p>Taiga watches him head toward the bedroom door, heart so full it feels fit to burst. Hokuto pauses in the doorway, looking back with a soft smile that steals Taiga’s breath all over again.</p><p>“Come on. I’m making omurice.”</p><p>Taiga floats through freshening up and dressing for the day, unable to stop smiling. The cozy domesticity feels natural as they work side by side prepping ingredients in the kitchen — Hokuto whisking eggs as Taiga chops green onions, lips meeting periodically in sweet, unhurried kisses.</p><p>Once the omurice is assembled, they settle across from each other at the small dining table. Hokuto insists on taking some pictures first to commemorate their first official breakfast together. Taiga just laughs and happily complies.</p><p>Despite the romantic start to the day, their conversation over the meal remains easy and familiar. Hokuto recounts a bridal makeover gone wrong, while Taiga laments about a celebrity divorce case keeping him late at the office. Through it all, their ankles stay linked together beneath the table.</p><p>After eating, Taiga washes up the dishes as Hokuto presses up behind him, arms circling his waist. Soft lips find the sensitive spot beneath Taiga’s ear. He shivers, nearly dropping the soapy plate in his hands.</p><p>“What do you think about a proper first date today?” Hokuto murmurs against his skin. “I believe we have a lot to celebrate.”</p><p>Taiga’s pulse leaps at the thought of stepping out into the world together, hand in hand, with no need for pretenses between them. “I’d love that. Anywhere you want to take me.”</p><p>“Mm, anywhere you want,” Hokuto counters, nuzzling into his hair.</p><p>Taiga pretends to consider, tapping the dish towel to his chin in exaggerated thought. “Well, there’s a new art exhibit at the museum I’ve been wanting to see …”</p><p>“Your wish is my command.” Hokuto nips his ear playfully. “But first, since we have nowhere to be quite yet … how about I finally get to appreciate having you all to myself now?”</p><p>His arms tighten possessively around Taiga, tone dropping an octave. The combination goes straight to Taiga’s core, and he lets Hokuto maneuver them to the living room couch without resistance.</p><p>They tumble onto the cushions, mouths meeting again heatedly. Hokuto blankets Taiga’s body with his own, hands roaming.</p><p>Taiga sighs into Hokuto’s mouth, the rest of the world fading away. He could spend forever here, trading languid kisses and whispered affections.</p><p>After weeks of pining, the bliss of having Hokuto in his arms like this leaves Taiga dizzy with euphoria. No more pretending or miscommunication. This connection between them now is real and tangible.</p><p>Later, Taiga will call the museum to verify hours and make dinner reservations somewhere fitting for a special celebration. For now, he loses himself blissfully in Hokuto’s passionate embrace, basking in the glow of a love story that is just beginning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>The glow of the laptop screen casts a soft light across Hokuto’s face as he finishes the Instagram live broadcast. Beside him, Alice shuts off the camera while Daigo lowers the teleprompter he was holding.</p><p>“Great job on the sponsorship announcement,” Alice says. “Very smooth delivery.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles, adrenaline still buzzing pleasantly from being “on” for his audience. “Thanks, I’m glad it went well.”</p><p>From where he’s seated on the sofa, Taiga looks up and gives Hokuto an approving nod, eyes warm behind his glasses. Hokuto’s chest fills with quiet contentment. Having Taiga here for support, even off-camera, means everything.</p><p>Things have changed so much since the early days of their pretend relationship contract. Back then, Hokuto insisted Taiga be prominently featured across his social media to sell their act. Now, with their connection being real, Hokuto doesn’t need the constant public displays. Taiga’s companionship is enough.</p><p>“Dinner, gentlemen?” Daigo calls from the kitchen area. He and Alice have laid out an assortment of Hokuto’s favorite foods in celebration.</p><p>The four of them gather around the small dining table, chatting casually as they eat. Naturally, the conversation loops back to Hokuto’s work.</p><p>“That athleisure campaign is going to take us to the next level,” Alice says enthusiastically between bites of salad.</p><p>Daigo nods. “Agreed. If we keep up this momentum, we’ll need to hire some junior consultants soon.”</p><p>Taiga smiles at Hokuto from across the table. “You’re going to need an in-house legal advisor pretty soon too.”</p><p>They all chuckle. Hokuto feels his chest swell with pride and gratitude. He’s worked hard over the years to build this business, but having his closest friends alongside him every step of the way makes success that much sweeter.</p><p>After dinner, Daigo and Alice tidy up while bantering back and forth good-naturedly. Their steadfast support means everything to Hokuto. Friends like them are invaluable treasures, he muses fondly.</p><p>Once they’ve left for the evening, Hokuto settles comfortably on the sofa beside Taiga. Having his boyfriend here so naturally already feels right, even after only six months of officially dating. Hokuto wants Taiga by his side like this always.</p><p>As if reading his mind, Taiga looks over. “Have you thought about getting a place together?”</p><p>Hokuto blinks in surprise, pulse quickening. “I have actually. But my apartment is basically my office too.” He rubs his neck sheepishly. “Probably not ideal for cohabitating.”</p><p>“We could get a two bedroom,” Taiga suggests. “One for work, one for us.”</p><p>Hokuto’s heart swells, touched and thrilled that Taiga is on the same page about progressing their relationship. “That sounds perfect. But fair warning, I can get distracted with work sometimes,” Hokuto says self-deprecatingly. “Thankfully I’m very tidy and a decent cook.”</p><p>Taiga smiles, squeezing Hokuto’s hand. “You know I don’t mind doing chores. My cooking skills are pretty basic though.”</p><p>“We’ll learn together then,” Hokuto says softly. Just picturing a life shared with Taiga leaves him dizzy with happiness.</p><p>Later, Hokuto settles into his nightly routine, savoring the domesticity of having Taiga here with him. They stand side-by-side at the bathroom sink, brushing their teeth and playfully bumping hips. Hokuto moves through his skincare regimen while Taiga curls up on the bed with a book, a comforting scene they’ve repeated many nights now. Hokuto doesn't think he’ll ever tire of it.</p><p>As he finishes journaling the day’s events, Hokuto can’t help but picture a future of nights like this together, in a place they share.</p><p>As they curl up in Hokuto's bed for the night, Taiga nuzzles against his shoulder. “We should do an official cohabitation contract,” he teases. “You know, for old time’s sake.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, pressing a kiss to Taiga’s hair. “Whatever my lawyer boyfriend wants. Though I’d sign anything just to wake up next to you each day.”</p><p>Taiga tilts his face up, meeting Hokuto in a sweet kiss. When they part, eyes shining with tenderness, Hokuto knows Taiga feels the same way.</p><p>As Hokuto switches off the light and pulls Taiga close, he sends up a silent prayer of gratitude. Through twists and turns, they found their way here together.</p><p>And Hokuto falls asleep dreaming of their future, always by each other’s side.</p>
