<h2 class="toc-heading">Still Breathing</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Enough surfing isn't a concept Shintaro is familiar with because he feels there's never enough time for surfing, especially when his spring has been pretty packed. The salty breeze ruffles his damp hair as he makes his way to the beachside dressing room. The waves have been perfect today, and he's still exhilarated, still riding the high of catching some amazing swells. He wonders when he will have enough time to come to this place again. As he reaches the dressing room, he starts peeling off his wetsuit.</p><p> </p><p>His phone, which is inside his bag, begins to buzz insistently. With a sigh, Shintaro reaches for it, glancing at the screen. It seems to be an unfamiliar number. He picks up the phone, holding it between his ear and shoulder as he continues to wriggle out of the wetsuit.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello?" he answers hastily.</p><p> </p><p>A feeble male voice is on the other end, sobbing incomprehensibly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "Is that you Morimoto Shintaro? I didn't know who else to call. Please help- I don't know what to do." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro freezes, the wetsuit half-off.</p><p> </p><p>"What? Who is this? What's happening?"</p><p> </p><p>"<em> Kyomo--fuck, this is the end, he's going to die now- I tried to convince him to get the surgery, but that fucking moron wouldn't listen-- </em>"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, I don't understand," Shintaro says. "Care to tell me who's there and why you call me?"</p><p> </p><p><em> "It's Tanaka Juri. I seriously don't know what to do. Kyomo was coughing up blood, and apparently, it was everywhere, and he collapsed, and they're resuscitating him-- please, I can't do this alone, I'm so fucking scared-I didn't know who else to call, and he gave me your number so that I could call you--when he—he--" </em> The voice cracks at the end.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro tries to process what he's hearing. He quickly yanks off the rest of his wetsuit, his heart suddenly pounding harder in his chest. He quickly connects that Tanaka Juri is Taiga's flatmate since he's heard the name several times. Shintaro also remembers Taiga being sick. He has accompanied Taiga for treatment at the hospital a couple of times, but to be honest, Taiga hasn't mentioned even once that his hanahaki disease is actually in <em> that </em> serious state. Shintaro hasn't wanted to fish for more information and Taiga has never told him about the details. But now it sounds like the situation is bad. Really bad.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, what?" Shintaro asks. "Where are you?"</p><p> </p><p>He manages to catch the name of the hospital while Juri continues sobbing on the other side about how fucking scared he is. It sounds like it's the same hospital area where Shintaro has accompanied Taiga before.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "I was wondering--if you could come here- I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I can do this alone--" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"No, of course, it's alright. I'll come right away," Shintaro says, trying to keep his voice steady.</p><p> </p><p>In the taxi, Shintaro feels his nervous heartbeat through his whole body. He mentally tries to make the car drive faster, looking outside through the window and scratching a spot of thin skin next to the nail of his index finger.</p><p> </p><p>As the car finally approaches the hospital, Shintaro's breath catches in his throat. He wonders if Taiga is still there, still with them. The taxi screeches to a halt.</p><p> </p><p>Throwing money at the driver, he bursts from the vehicle and races toward the hospital entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Juri has managed to send him directions to where he is. Although Shintaro remembers seeing only a couple of pictures of Juri before, and the room is full of other people, he spots him immediately once he arrives in the lobby area on the right floor.</p><p> </p><p>Juri sits slumped in a plastic chair next to a black-haired guy Shintaro doesn't recall seeing before. Juri looks... awful. His eyes are not only red-rimmed, bloodshot from crying, but there's also a hollow, haunted look in them. His unkempt hair sticks out in disarray, and his hands tremble as he clutches a crumpled tissue between his fingers.</p><p> </p><p>The other man with black hair next to Juri sits with a serious, blank expression. His posture is stiff, his back rigidly straight, and then Shintaro notices that his clothes are covered with blood. He must have been the one who discovered Taiga and called for help. Thank gods he was there because otherwise, for sure, Taiga would already be-- Shintaro shivers. He doesn't want to think about that.</p><p> </p><p>As Shintaro approaches Juri and the black-haired man, a knot tightens in his stomach. There's no need for introductions. His eyes lock onto Juri's, searching for answers he's both afraid and desperate to hear.</p><p> </p><p>"Is Kyomo--?" Shintaro starts, his voice catching in his throat because he can't say those words aloud.</p><p> </p><p>Juri raises his head and looks him in the eye, and for a moment, it feels like time stands still. Then, Juri's composure shatters. He clutches the tissue tighter, his shoulders heaving with silent sobs.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro feels a horrible wave of nausea wash over him. Like someone has just hit his chest hard.</p><p> </p><p>"He's alive," Juri manages to sob hoarsely. There seems to be no end to his crying as he manages to add that the ambulance staff managed to resuscitate Taiga and that he's now breathing on his own. Shintaro immediately feels the heaviness coming out of his chest.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank goodness," Shintaro exhales in relief.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired man beside them remains silent.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro looks at him, realizing he still doesn't know who he is.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry," Shintaro begins tentatively, "I don't think we've met before. Are you also a friend of Kyomo's?"</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired man nods slowly. "Something like that," he replies with a reserved tone.</p><p> </p><p>Their short conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a nurse. She informs Juri that he can now see Taiga, but unfortunately, only he can go since Taiga has written Juri as his closest contact person. She tells him he's still asleep but probably wakes up soon.</p><p> </p><p>Juri nods, wiping his tears with the back of his hand. He looks at Shintaro and the other guy.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll be back," he says softly to them before following the nurse down the corridor.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro realizes that he's left alone with the black-haired guy and that he should probably try to have some sort of conversation with him.</p><p> </p><p>"Um," Shintaro starts and leans a little bit forward, trying to catch the guy's eye contact, but the guy only remains looking forward.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" Shintaro tries.</p><p> </p><p>The guy sighs. "I'm not sure," he answers.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, I didn't know how bad Kyomo's hanahaki actually was, so this has been quite a shock-"</p><p> </p><p>"Wait," the guy interrupts him. "Did you know about this? That he's sick with that?"</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro realizes that it's quite impolite to discuss someone else's business, especially their health record, like that because he doesn't even know who the guy is. But then again, the guy must already be very aware of the situation, what Taiga's sickness is, to begin with, and that the situation is as bad as it can get.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I did. But not that many details," Shintaro eventually says carefully.</p><p> </p><p>The look on the guy's face is something that Shintaro doesn't quite know how to describe it.</p><p> </p><p>"Well," the guy sighs, "I'm glad that he's been able to talk to at least someone. Did- did he ever tell you how long it's been going on?"</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro shakes his head. "Like I said, I don't know about too many details, and maybe I shouldn't be the one telling you this. But-"</p><p> </p><p>He glances at the guy's bloodied clothes before continuing.</p><p> </p><p>"-but he did mention his colleague from his previous musical. And that they've been having this shitty <em>situation-ship </em>where they've been going back and forth."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh."</p><p> </p><p>They fall silent again, and Shintaro notices the guy keeps thinking very hard about something.</p><p> </p><p>After 20 minutes, Juri comes back to them.</p><p> </p><p>"He woke up," Juri informs them. "He's alive. For now, at least."</p><p> </p><p>Then he shoots an angry look at the black-haired guy. "Definitely not thanks to <em>you,</em>" he spits out, his voice sounding bitter.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro is confused about the comment. Didn't the guy actually call an ambulance and save Taiga? The guy doesn't say anything to Juri, only drops his gaze to the floor. He looks somewhat guilty but also like he'd still be thoughtful.</p><p> </p><p>Another nurse approaches them. He addresses the black-haired guy, his voice gentle. "Excuse me, sir. Would you like to follow me? We have a shower room available, and we can provide you with clean clothes. You might also want to speak with the doctor briefly. I understand that the shock must still be quite overwhelming."</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired guy looks up, his eyes clouded with fatigue and lingering distress. He nods slowly and rises from his seat.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," he murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro watches as the nurse leads the guy down the corridor, hand lightly resting on his arm.</p><p> </p><p>When the guy has disappeared out of sight, Shintaro turns to look at Juri, who still looks pretty terrible. Like a very feeble thing. The dark circles under his eyes and the way his shoulders slump tell just how exhausted and emotionally drained he is.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro hesitates for a moment, then decides to ask carefully.</p><p> </p><p>"Is there anything I can do for you?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri looks up at him, his eyes glassy. </p><p> </p><p>"Well-- a hug would be nice right now. Really nice."</p><p> </p><p>True. Juri definitely looks like he's in need of one big hug at that moment. </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro steps closer and wraps his arms around Juri. Juri immediately melts into the embrace, clutching onto Shintaro as if he were a lifeline. He rests his head against Shintaro's shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>As they stand there in a hug, Shintaro notices an uncomfortable smell—sweat and dirt—emanating from Juri. He hesitates, then decides to speak up gently.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm, Juri, when was the last time you showered?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri pulls away from the hug, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. He looks down. "I don't remember," he admits.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro nods, trying to be as understanding as possible. "Maybe you should go home and take a shower now. It might help you feel a bit better."</p><p> </p><p>But as soon as Shintaro suggests it, Juri's face contorts with fear and reluctance. He shakes his head vehemently, and his voice trembles.</p><p> </p><p>"I can't go back there. Not today. The scene with all the blood--it's horrible and disgusting. I don't want to see it. That guy, <em>Hokuto</em>, already told me there was a lot of blood."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro ponders for a moment until he gets the idea.</p><p> </p><p>"Right. You know, I don't live that far from here. Why don't we take a taxi to my place? You can shower there, and I'll cook us something to eat."</p><p> </p><p>Juri looks at Shintaro with appreciation, his eyes still glassy. He nods.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Shintaro. That sounds really nice."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro smiles reassuringly.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on, let's go."</p><p> </p><p>He gently guides Juri towards the exit.</p><p> </p><p>In the taxi, Shintaro tries to offer some reassurance as Juri seems to stay looking gloomy and miserable.</p><p> </p><p>"Luckily, things are alright now," he mentions.</p><p> </p><p>"For now," Juri says gloomily. "This might have been the first time, but I'm already afraid of the next one. I know this is only the start, and I'm not sure if I can handle it."</p><p> </p><p>"What was the situation earlier with that guy, by the way?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri sighs. "That's Matsumura Hokuto. Hokuto and Kyomo's situation is... pretty complicated. I've tried to interfere and talk some sense to him, but Kyomo is such a stubborn, complex person who loves to roll in his anxiety. As you probably know, he's also not the type who would talk about his emotions that freely. What I've understood is that Hokuto isn't any better, so you can imagine the result."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro nods, understanding immediately.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, hmmm. Then again, sometimes, those things aren't so easy to explain or solve. Sometimes, things just happen between two people."</p><p> </p><p>Juri sighs again, a weary sound escaping from him. "I guess you're right."</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the ride passes in silence, both men lost in their thoughts. When the taxi finally pulls up to Shintaro's place, and Shintaro has paid, they both step out.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on in," Shintaro says, leading the way up to his apartment. He unlocks the door and gestures for Juri to enter first. "Make yourself at home."</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry for interfering," Juri says.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, Shintaro shows Juri where the shower is, pointing down the hallway. "The bathroom is the second door on the left. There are fresh towels in the cupboard right outside."</p><p> </p><p>Juri nods, looking exhausted but grateful. "Thank you."</p><p> </p><p>"Is oyakodon fine for dinner?" Shintaro asks as he heads toward the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Juri's face looks even more grateful as he catches the word, and there's even a hint of a smile appearing. "Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, Shintaro."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro smiles back. "No problem. Take your time in the shower. I'll get started on dinner."</p><p> </p><p>Juri disappears down the hallway, and Shintaro hears the sound of water running a few moments later. He sets to work in the kitchen, trying to focus on preparing the meal and not on the worry nibbling at the back of his mind. But as he chops the ingredients, Shintaro can't help but think how stressed he's also been. He's been trying to hold himself and push his own emotions aside. After all, Juri and Hokuto looked so fragile and devastated earlier that day that his nature couldn't help but show support and hold all of them together. He could manage and go through his feelings afterward, probably once he's alone and underwater preferably.</p><p> </p><p>Now, he only hopes that the comfort of a warm meal and a shower will at least help Juri feel a little bit better. Even if just for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>As Shintaro finishes cooking, he hears the sound of the shower turning off. A few minutes later, Juri reappears, looking markedly better. The transformation is actually kind of striking.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro looks at him properly for the first time and realizes that Juri is quite good-looking. His piercings dangle from his ears, catching the light. His ash-colored hair, now wet, is pulled back, showing his forehead and complementing his sharp cheekbones. The exhaustion and distress in his eyes are still there, but he looks a lot more human. Probably smells better as well.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro tries to shake that thought off. He shouldn't think about how Juri smells like. And he should definitely not think that now Juri must have used his shampoo and they must share the scent now.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey," Shintaro says. "Feeling better?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, thanks. I needed that."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro gestures to the table, where he's set out two bowls of steaming oyakodon. "Come, sit. Food's ready."</p><p> </p><p>Juri hesitates for a moment, then takes a step closer to Shintaro.</p><p> </p><p>"Actually," he starts. "Could I get another hug right now? I think I'd need it."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro laughs because that's the cutest thing to say. But that's a direct request so Shintaro can definitely comply with that. Without a word, he steps forward and wraps his arms around Juri, pulling him into a firm but gentle embrace. The stress and worry have been plaguing them both, and Shintaro realizes he's also actually feeling better when he feels Juri's arm around him. That is kind of weird and unordinary, of course, considering that they just met a few hours ago. Then again, the situation itself has been nothing but ordinary on that day.  </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," Juri murmurs. "For helping me."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro rubs Juri's back. "It's okay. Sometimes we all need a little support."</p><p> </p><p>After a few moments, they pull away from the hug, and Juri looks a bit more at ease.</p><p> </p><p>"Let's eat," Shintaro says, leading him to the table.</p><p> </p><p>They sit down and begin to eat. Juri's expression relaxes with each bite, and he even manages a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>"This is good," Juri says between mouthfuls. "I didn't realize how hungry I was. You're a great cook!"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm glad you like it. It's nice to see you eating. You looked like you could use the energy."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, it's been a rough day. I appreciate this."</p><p> </p><p>As they continue eating and talking, Shintaro watches Juri, noticing how his big eyes, though tired, are kind of beautiful. The color there is a striking shade of brown that compliments Juri's other features.</p><p> </p><p>"How are you holding up?" Shintaro asks after a while, genuinely curious.</p><p> </p><p>Juri sighs, setting down his chopsticks. "Honestly? I don't know. I feel like I'm on the verge of falling apart, but I can't. Kyomo needs me to be strong, but it's hard."</p><p> </p><p>"You're doing your best, and that's all anyone can ask for. He's a lucky guy for having a friend like you."</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks. That means a lot."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro notices that Juri's face has dropped since Taiga was mentioned, and the weight of the day's events is clearly pulling him back into his gloomy mood. Shintaro realizes he should probably try to steer the conversation away from Taiga. There are better times to delve into that topic than during that night. Instead, Shintaro decides to learn more about Juri himself.</p><p> </p><p>"So, what do you do when you're not dealing with- all this?" Shintaro asks, trying to keep the mood light and conversational.</p><p> </p><p>Juri seems to appreciate the change of topic. "I work at a bar downtown," he says. "It's a pretty lively place, and it keeps me busy. Before that, I had a few other jobs. Nothing too exciting, but they paid the bills."</p><p> </p><p>"That sounds interesting. What's it like working at a bar?"</p><p> </p><p>"It has its moments. Some nights are great when there's basically just good music, good vibes, and people having fun. On other nights, it's mainly dealing with drunk salarymen. But overall, I like it. The people I work with are like a second family. And I guess I like it because I don't really see anyone outside of work anyway. I don't have that many friends, I'm not seeing anyone, and I mostly just nest at home and play games on my days off."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro nods, but in the back of his mind, he realizes he's caught a bit too clearly on the fact that Juri has just mentioned he isn't dating anyone. He tries to ignore that.</p><p> </p><p>"I see," Shintaro says.</p><p> </p><p>Then Juri starts asking questions about his surfing and all his hobbies with sincere interest, and Shintaro tells about those things gladly.</p><p> </p><p>In the middle of a conversation, Shintaro once again catches himself with a sudden thought. It's weird getting along so well with someone one just met. Both new and fresh. True, his life is very different from Juri's. Yet, their conversation keeps flowing all naturally as they seem to share many similar things hobby-wise and there seems to be a shared humor underneath that just clicks.  </p><p> </p><p>When they have finished their meals, and their conversation eventually winds down, Juri glances at his watch. He sighs.</p><p> </p><p>"I should probably start looking for a hotel for the night," he says defeatedly, reaching for his phone.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro can only shake his head immediately at that.</p><p> </p><p>"What? No way! You're not staying at some hotel. You're going to sleep here."</p><p> </p><p>Juri looks surprised. "Are you sure? I don't want to be a burden."</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, I'm sure! You can take my bed, and I'll sleep on the couch. It's no burden at all."</p><p> </p><p>Juri hesitates, clearly touched by the offer but also concerned. "I mean, I don't want to trouble you since you've already done so much for me today--"</p><p> </p><p>"And I'd do it all again," Shintaro says firmly. "You need a good night's sleep now, and there's no way I'm letting you wander around looking for a hotel at this hour. Just stay here. Please."</p><p> </p><p>Juri looks at Shintaro for a long moment, and then he nods sheepishly. "Okay. Thank you. I'd... really appreciate it."</p><p> </p><p>"Good. Now that's settled. Let me get you some blankets and pillows."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know how many times I've thanked you already today. I feel embarrassed."</p><p> </p><p>"Please!" </p><p> </p><p>They head to Shintaro's bedroom, where Shintaro quickly strips the bed and replaces the sheets with fresh ones. He then grabs a couple of blankets and pillows from the closet and heads back to the living room to set up the couch.</p><p> </p><p>"You sure you're okay with this?" Juri asks, still looking a bit uncertain as he stands in the doorway of Shintaro's bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>"Absolutely! It's really not a big deal. Get some rest. You've had a rough day."</p><p> </p><p>"Okay. Good night."</p><p> </p><p>"Good night. Sleep well."</p><p> </p><p>Juri gives a small, final smile before retreating to the bedroom and closing the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro lies down on the couch, adjusting the blankets and pillows to make himself comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>When waiting for the sleep, he thinks about the moment he saw Juri, who looked so disheveled and so distressed. He thinks about the overwhelming urge that snapped at him and how he simply wanted to help him. The grateful look Juri sent at him throughout the day made him feel good. It just feels good to be needed, to be able to provide comfort and support to someone who's been through so much.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Shintaro's eyelids grow heavy, and he starts to drift off. When he falls asleep, he feels content, knowing that he's done everything he could to help someone else.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Shintaro wakes up early. He quietly slips out of his couch and heads to the kitchen to start preparing breakfast. He sets out some rice, eggs, and a few side dishes, working quietly not to wake Juri. As the food cooks, he brews some tea.</p><p> </p><p>After a while, he hears a door sliding open. Turning, he sees Juri coming out from the bedroom, wearing only a t-shirt and boxers. His hair is tousled, and he rubs his eyes, looking sleepy but slightly more at ease than the previous night.</p><p> </p><p>"Morning," Shintaro says with a smile. "I hope you slept well."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I did. Thank you. How about you?"</p><p> </p><p>"All good! Breakfast is almost ready. Have a seat."</p><p> </p><p>They settle at the small dining table, sharing a comfortable breakfast. The conversation is light, with Shintaro asking Juri about his favorite games and Juri inquiring about Shintaro's latest surfing trip. It feels easy and natural, a welcome change from the tension of the previous day. It's almost domestic within its all normalcy.</p><p> </p><p>As they talk and they're almost finished with eating, Juri's phone rings. He glances at the screen and his face drops. He mouths "Kyomo" to Shintaro before standing up and answering.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomo?" Juri's voice is anxious. "How are you doing?"</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro watches Juri closely, trying to gauge the conversation from his end. Juri listens intently, his expression shifting.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean it's gone?" Juri suddenly shouts into the phone, causing Shintaro to sit up straighter.</p><p> </p><p>Juri listens again, his face growing more incredulous. "No way. No fucking way."</p><p> </p><p>The conversation continues, with Juri mostly listening and occasionally interjecting with short, urgent questions. Shintaro can only catch snippets, but it's enough to sense that something significant has happened. Finally, Juri hangs up, looking bewildered.</p><p> </p><p>"What is it? What's going on?" Shintaro asks. He also stands up and walks to Juri.</p><p> </p><p>Juri takes a deep breath, trying to steady himself. "Kyomo. He just told me that his hanahaki disease- that it's gone. Completely gone."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro blinks. "Gone? How is that possible?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri shakes his head, still clearly processing the news. "I have no idea. He said he woke up this morning and talked with Hokuto, and then he started feeling different, like a huge weight had been lifted. He went through some tests, and the doctors confirmed it. There's no disease left, only withering flowers inside."</p><p> </p><p>"But- how?"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know," Juri admits, his voice quivering a little. "But he's okay. He's going to be completely okay."</p><p> </p><p>They sit there for a moment, letting the unexpected news sink in.</p><p> </p><p>"That's incredible," Shintaro finally says.</p><p> </p><p>Juri nods, and his eyes are suddenly glistening. "It really is."</p><p> </p><p>"So, they did manage to talk things through, Kyomo and Hokuto," Shintaro muses aloud.</p><p> </p><p>"Apparently miracles do happen."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro watches Juri's expression. "You're still suspicious about Hokuto, though," he observes.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, yeah," Juri admits. "But whatever that weird guy told Kyomo, it worked. Maybe that's the most important thing."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. Sometimes, the person we least expect has the power to change everything."</p><p> </p><p>"True. Most of all, I'm just- so relieved! Aaaaah, I can't believe this!"</p><p> </p><p>Before Shintaro can respond, Juri overcomes with emotion, impulsively leans in, and wraps his arms around Shintaro in a tight hug. Shintaro chuckles and hugs him back.</p><p> </p><p>As they pull back slightly, their faces remain close. Juri's eyes lock onto Shintaro's, but neither of them moves away. Without fully realizing how it happens, they both lean forward at the same time. Their lips brush against each other before Shintaro tilts his head, and Juri brings his mouth to his. They share one long kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Then they both seem to freeze and pull back at exactly the same time. Juri's face is all flushed as he steps one step back.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, I--" Juri starts, but Shintaro shakes his head quickly.</p><p> </p><p>"No, it's okay," Shintaro says, his voice a bit breathless. He can still feel the warmth of Juri's lips on his.</p><p> </p><p>Juri blinks. "I didn't mean to--"</p><p> </p><p>"Like I said, it's okay," Shintaro interrupts.</p><p> </p><p>Juri falls silent. He watches Shintaro under his brows.</p><p> </p><p>Then he smirks.</p><p> </p><p>They both move at the same time. Their lips meet again, this time with more hunger and intensity. Juri's hands find their way to Shintaro's shoulders, pulling him closer, while Shintaro's fingers thread through Juri's hair, deepening the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>They kiss hungrily, and it feels like all the emotions of the past day—fear, relief, gratitude—are poured into the moment.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss deepens quickly, becoming more intense. Their hands start to wander, exploring each other's bodies with increasing urgency. Shintaro's fingers trace the curve of Juri's back while Juri's hands slide under Shintaro's shirt and start caressing his stomach. Shintaro can't help but think about how Juri's fingertips feel hard and strong. They feel so good against his bare skin.</p><p> </p><p>Juri breaks the kiss for a moment, his breath hot and ragged. "I haven't even gone to the toilet or brushed my teeth," he murmurs with a half-smile, but Shintaro shakes his head, pulling him back in.</p><p> </p><p>"Doesn't matter," Shintaro whispers against Juri's lips, and they continue kissing, stumbling slightly as they move.</p><p> </p><p>Juri leads them toward Shintaro's bedroom, where the unmade bed awaits, the sheets still rumpled from Juri's sleep the night before. They fall into it together, Juri pulling Shintaro to lie on top of him. Juri's hands tug at Shintaro's shirt, pulling it over his head, while Shintaro's fingers fumble with the hem of Juri's t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Their kisses grow more urgent until Shintaro moves his mouth away from Juri's, his lips traveling down Juri's neck. He nibbles the soft skin, and Juri arches into him, his hands gripping Shintaro's shoulders tightly.</p><p> </p><p>Juri's shirt joins Shintaro's on the floor, and their bare chests press together.</p><p> </p><p>The tea in their mugs get all cold before they manage themselves back to the table.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>When Taiga steps inside, Juri hovers close by, fussing.</p><p> </p><p>"Careful, careful," he hushes.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga scoffs, rolling his eyes. "I'm not going to break. I'm fine."</p><p> </p><p>Juri doesn't relent. "I'm still going to spoil you a little bit."</p><p> </p><p>"Ha, I will so remember that next time when you're just asleep in the afternoon, and I ask you to do something."</p><p> </p><p>They walk through the hallway, taking in the sight of the freshly cleaned floors. The cleaning service has done an excellent job; there are no remnants of blood or anything else unpleasant in sight. The only thing missing is their old carpet, which has been thrown away. It's kind of lucky if that was the only thing that got ruined.</p><p> </p><p>"Looks like they did a thorough job," Taiga comments as they head into the living room.</p><p> </p><p>Juri nods. "Yup, they did. And it's good to have you back home."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath and looks around at the familiar surroundings as he sits down on the couch. "It's good to be home."</p><p> </p><p>"Except," Juri continues, "now I'm assuming you're going to drag your boyfriend here every night, and I'll need to start wearing earplugs whenever I'm here because I'm so not going to listen to <em>you two</em> making bedroom sounds."</p><p> </p><p>"Aw, you should consider stopping hating Hokuto."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't <em> hate </em> him. I just don't want to hear you two doing anything. And I still haven't forgotten that that guy almost killed you."</p><p> </p><p>"Technically speaking, it was myself, but oh well," Taiga retorts, then smirks. "Besides, you'll learn to love him. He's actually a great cook."</p><p> </p><p>Juri shoots him a terse look. "So, I'm supposed to forgive him because he can make a decent meal?"</p><p> </p><p>"A man's stomach is the way to his heart, or whatever they say."</p><p> </p><p>"Is that why you fell for him? Because he feeds you?" Juri snorts.</p><p> </p><p>"Partly. But mostly because he makes me laugh, and he makes me happy."</p><p> </p><p>Juri rolls his eyes. "Well, as long as he doesn't poison you with his culinary skills, I guess I can live with it."</p><p> </p><p>"Speaking of bedroom sounds," Taiga says grinningly and then points at Juri's neck, "what's that? A <em> hickey</em>? Are you like fourteen? Do you have something to tell me?"</p><p> </p><p>Juri shifts awkwardly, his face flushing, and his fingers come to touch the bruise-like mark on his neck. "Yeah, well, errrr..."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's grin widens. "Don't tell me I'm away for a week, and you manage to find yourself a lover meanwhile?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, we've been seeing each other quite intensively now."</p><p> </p><p>"So, do I know this person?"</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's jaw drops, and he leans in with excitement. "No way. Who is it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, if I say it's actually all thanks to you, you must guess-" Juri continues mysteriously.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga bursts out laughing as the realization hits him. "Noooooo way. <em>Shintaro</em>?! Seriously?! You and Morimoto Shintaro?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, things happened," Juri admits, a small smile sneaking onto his face. "I guess we're exclusive now."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shakes his head in wonder. "Can it really be that quick and easy?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, for your information, some people can do it without all the drama. Unlike others, krhm," Juri says pointedly.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga snorts. "Right, because you and Shintaro are just a paragon of calm."</p><p> </p><p>"But he wouldn't even let me get all anxious. The guy is just too honest and straightforward."</p><p> </p><p>"So, what did he say? What happened? You must tell me everything."</p><p> </p><p>"After sleeping together a few times, he forced us two to sit down calmly and have a proper talk. Then he told me that he really, really likes me and would like to get to know me better," Juri explains. "And he asked if I would mind if we started seeing each other exclusively, without any other dates."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looks at Juri, a combination of surprise and happiness on his face. "That's... wow. I'm still processing this."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, for your reminder of something that you said only a few seconds ago, it was you who gave me his phone number and asked me to call him!"</p><p> </p><p>"True. So, I guess I did play cupid without knowing, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you really did," Juri says and sighs in content. "And now look where we are."</p><p> </p><p>"So, have you told him about your snoring yet?" Taiga teases him.</p><p> </p><p>Juri shoves him. "I do not snore!"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, but you definitely do sometimes," Taiga continues and clicks his tongue. "And wait until he finds out about you nesting at home every day and not showing your nose outside for two days."</p><p> </p><p>"If he can handle my way of sleeping, he can handle my lifestyle!"</p><p> </p><p>"True that. But hey, just promise me one thing," Taiga says, still grinning.</p><p> </p><p>"What?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't forget to invite me to the wedding."</p><p> </p><p>Juri chuckles. "You're impossible."</p><p> </p><p>"And you're in love," Taiga sighs, trying to sound overdramatic. It's easy to tell he's not angry because then he sighs contently, sounding utterly happy himself as he adds, "Welcome to the club, I guess."</p><p> </p><p>Juri rolls his eyes but can't help but smile. "Yeah, yeah. Just don't get too used to having the apartment to yourself. Since I might have plans to spend a lot of time at Shintaro's place in the future,"</p><p> </p><p>"Deal," Taiga says, still grinning. "As long as you also promise to keep things, you know, PG enough when you're going to be here."</p><p> </p><p>"No promises."</p>
