<p>“Off to a good start, aren’t we?” Jesse commented the events that were unfolding in front of them.</p><p>Kochi glowered at him.</p><p>His plan of escaping had just failed.</p><p>He had hidden a sachet full of utensils in the woods the last time he had been out there to lay out the groundwork for his grand plan. But some idiot who had been hunting out there had found the bag and thought he’d be rewarded for reporting on someone's apparent attempt to escape the iron claw of the government.</p><p>That moron’s trust in the authorities had been misplaced thou as instead of believing his story about how he had indeed just found the sachet in the woods, the government had made an example of him and was now declaring his punishment on live television.</p><p>Luckily for Kochi the sachet had never been connected to him. He had made sure to either make the items himself or then bought them from all around. He had even asked Jesse for help so that the merchants wouldn’t start gossiping how he was buying more gear than normally.</p><p>Still, it had been his one and only chance out of the looming future that hang above his head. There was no way that he could manage to gather the utensils again without people starting to raise question. He also knew that without the content of that damned sachet he was not going to make it in the woods pass a couple of days.</p><p>He was capable, he had been hunting and gathering food for his and Jesse’s families for as long as he could remember. But that was also the reason he knew that he had no changes without his gear.</p><p>So that was it then.</p><p>Kochi slumped in the chair, his mom would have commented on his posture had she been home, but she was also working to make their ends meet.</p><p>“Well, for the silver linings, at least it's not you on TV. If they were doing their jobs even a tad bit better, they would have tried to look for the person who actually owns the content. Lucky for you they are lazy ass bastards who only want to get more power and don't care about what's really going on.</p><p>Even if Kochi knew all of that, the outcome still wasn't what he had been hoping for. He was indeed very lucky that the government wasn't interested in looking for the real culprit, but rather had jumped at their change of reminding its citizens that they should not try to rebel. If everything had gone as he had planned, thou, then in couple of days from now he would have been out deep in the woods, already building up his little hideout.</p><p>But now all the meticulous planning had been undone in just a few moments. And there was no longer a way out for him.</p><p>All that was left now was to just wait. As the day the government would announce the results was mere days away.</p>
