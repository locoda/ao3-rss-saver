    <h2 class="toc-heading">let's get married</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>It was a Sunday when Taiga got a text from his manager.</p><p>It wasn’t that interesting, he gets texts from his manager all the time. TV appearances, studio recordings, rehearsal time changes, and whatnot. Most of the texts were mostly about work and his schedule for the next few days, and this is how the text started at first. Taiga sighs and reads it, but what was at the end of the text that intrigued him.</p><p>Kyomoto-san, I noticed that you hadn’t been yourself lately. One of the producers for an upcoming reality TV dating show had reached out to me hoping that you could audition for it. I’ve attached a file that describes the premise of the show, as well as the complete list of the crew working on it. Please let me know if you are interested so I can contact the casting director to meet with you.</p><p>*</p><p>“A reality TV dating show?” Taiga asks his manager the next day, scoffing at the silly premise.</p><p>Taiga had spent the night before reading the file his manager sent. The show, titled “We Got Married!”, was about 2 celebrities pretending to be a couple, living together for 1 month and completing challenges together weekly. Taiga thought it was corny.</p><p>His manager shrugged, “One of the producers reached out to me, and the premise looked interesting. I thought you’d be interested.”</p><p>Taiga sighs, has he been this obvious?</p><p>His manager pats him on the back, “You don’t have to agree to it, I just thought I’d ask. You haven’t been the same since you and Maika-san broke up, you know.”</p><p>In truth, Taiga hasn’t been the same in a long, long time. His music has been lacklustre and the songs he’d been writing had been mediocre at best, but no one seemed to notice until very recently when he and his girlfriend broke up.</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Taiga tells his manager. He appreciates that he worries but really, a reality TV dating show? Taiga doesn’t know how to feel about it but takes a mental note.</p><p>Taiga is an artist, one of Japan’s biggest. He’s been singing since he was 5 and was discovered at the age of 12, after a video of him singing one of his original songs went viral. By his early 20s, he had released 5 critically acclaimed albums and had performed in the country’s biggest stadiums. Now at the age of 28, he is known to be one of Japan’s greatest singers/songwriters.</p><p>But despite his career success, his love life had been the exact opposite. He’s had several relationships before, but they always end up failing. His most recent relationship with a fellow singer, Maika, had been going steady. He thought he had been a good boyfriend, a great boyfriend even, tabloids were saying that they were going to get married soon, but one day, Maika called it quits. Taiga asked her why, and she said that she was sick of being second in his life and that she felt like he never really truly loved him. They dated for a year before she broke things off.</p><p>What’s worse is that she went on Instagram Live and blasted him, telling the entire world about how he was in the relationship. It got so bad that Taiga had to stop appearing in music shows for a while, but thankfully the buzz around him died down pretty quickly and he was able to go back to work normally.</p><p>Since then, he’d been closed off. His previous relationship had traumatised him so much that he had shut himself out. It had been showing in his recent releases and performances, even though he thought he’d been hiding it pretty well.</p><p>Taiga basically drowns himself in work these days, and on days he isn’t recording or writing new songs, he is home watching anime or playing games. He’d become a glorified hikikomori.</p><p>*</p><p>He sighs again, after recording the 5th take of a song he’s been working on.</p><p>“Maybe we should call it a day, Kyomoto-san. You seem tired and it’s getting late.” His producer says.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Taiga says as he steps out of the booth, “I’m usually not like this.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Kyomoto-san. We all have those days. Go home and rest for today.”</p><p>On the car ride home, he texts one of his closest friends if he wanted to come over and have a few drinks, he needed it. Jesse replied almost immediately.</p><p>Of course!!!</p><p>*</p><p>Jesse’s loud voice and laugh fill Taiga’s empty apartment with light almost instantaneously, and with a few cans of beer and glasses of wine, Taiga felt better already.</p><p>Jesse was one of the friends that were there with him when his “scandal” was happening. He and Juri were his main support systems, he’d always run to them whenever something in his life went wrong or when he just needed company, and tonight, he really, really needed the company.</p><p>“Thank you for being here, by the way,” Taiga says, feeling a little sappy after a few drinks.<br/>
Jesse hugs him, “It’s nothing, Taiga. Y’know I’m always here for you,” he says, placing a kiss on Taiga’s forehead. If Taiga was sober it would send him into a laughing fit and push Jesse away, but tonight he was feeling a little lonely, so he allowed himself to be held and coddled for a bit.</p><p>He and Jesse catch up on a few things, about work and life. Jesse’s a music producer, so they mostly work with each other and can relate to a lot of the industry’s problems, but they’ve also been friends for years, so it felt easy to tell Jesse anything.</p><p>“I’ve been considering something lately,” Taiga says, taking a sip of the drink Jesse made him. He’s not sure what it was but it was delicious and he’s had 5 of them tonight, “I think you’d like it.”</p><p>Jesse perks up, “Do tell.”</p><p>“My manager told me about this reality TV dating show called We Got Married. It’s about 2 people pretending to be married and living together for a month while completing weekly challenges together. He said,” Taiga sits up and pushes his glasses, pretending to be his manager, “‘I think you’d be interested, Kyomoto-kun.’ I mean, how crazy is that.”</p><p>Jesse laughs loudly at the thought of Taiga being in a reality TV show, much less a dating one.</p><p>“So? Are you auditioning?” Jesse asks after his laughing fit.</p><p>“Me?” Taiga says, pointing at himself.</p><p>Jesse nudges him, “yes you! Who else?”</p><p>Taiga thinks for a moment. It has been a few days since his manager told him about the show, and he hasn’t given it much thought, until now.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Jesse puts an arm around Taiga, “Look, last year has been hard for you, with the whole scandal thing. You deserve to do something fun and exciting, and this seems like the perfect opportunity! I mean, how hard could it be? Plus, you might end up dating the person you get partnered up with! Maybe you can move on from…you-know-who.”</p><p>“You’re right, and you know what,” Taiga chugs his drink and grabs his phone. “I’ll tell my manager I want to audition.” He opens his contacts and looks for his manager.</p><p>“That’s the spirit! Go Taiga!” Jesse cheers on.<br/>
*</p><p>“Kyomoto-san, I just want to make sure I understood, you want to audition for the reality show?” His manager asked him the next day.</p><p>Taiga nodded, removing his sunglasses, “Yes. I’m sorry I sent that text last night, I should’ve waited till today to tell you.”</p><p>Maybe drinking with Jesse till dawn in his house wasn’t the best idea. He’d forgotten that he had sent that text to his manager and that he had a recording session the next day, so he shows up to the studio hungover. He’s never drinking again.</p><p>“I’ll contact the casting director then. I’ll tell you the details when they reply.”</p><p>Taiga doesn’t know what he’s gotten himself into.</p><p>*</p><p>A few days later, his manager texts him the details for the interview and audition process for We Got Married!</p><p>And then the next thing he knew, he was being interviewed by the producers of the show in a tiny room.</p><p>The audition process didn’t feel like an actual audition. He’s done past acting projects, and they were nothing like it. The producers asked him questions about living with another person for a month (has no issues with it), if he had a preference for men or women (Taiga says it doesn’t matter. He’s fine with both), being intimate with a potential stranger (Taiga had a hard time with this one, but he said as long as the other person is okay with it, he’ll be fine.)</p><p>Then, 3 days later, he was contacted by his manager that he was chosen to be the first participant for the pilot season of the show.</p><p>“They said that there was a meeting tomorrow to discuss how the show is going to work and such, everyone will be there. Producers and crew.” His manager only said.</p><p>They told him that his work schedule would be adjusted so that he’ll spend more time at home, which concerned him at first, but he was assured that his actual work wouldn’t be affected. During the meeting, he noticed that the person he was going to fake marry isn’t there.</p><p>“We’re going to reveal your partner on the day you move into the house with them, Kyomoto-san. It’s to preserve the authenticity of the show. They had this meeting yesterday, so rest assured they’re fully aware of the rules.” One of the producers said.</p><p>The rules discussed were fairly simple. Cameras were placed everywhere (excluding the bathroom)  in the house they’re staying, turned on remotely every 7 AM and off every 12 MN. They were given a set budget of 500,000 ¥ for their groceries and other necessities for the next month, so spending their own money is strictly prohibited, groceries were provided for the first week. Intimacy isn’t required but encouraged, but for the most part, producers hoped they would get along for one month, though sex was strictly prohibited. Challenges were given weekly, if they fail to do the challenge, their budget is cut.</p><p>After Taiga was given the rundown of the show, he was told that they would start filming in 2 weeks.</p><p>He texts his friends about the meeting and how he’s suddenly not so sure about this thing anymore.</p><p>Juri texts him back complaining about how Taiga never told him but cheered him on nonetheless. Jesse only sent a funny-looking sticker with the words ‘I love you’. He has weird friends but he’s grateful for them.</p><p>He mentally prepares himself for his “married life.”</p>
