      <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga is standing alone on top of the hill, looking out at the serene town below. He’s holding a professional camera, all set to take some beautiful pictures. The sun is slowly setting, painting everything with a warm, golden glow. As he takes a deep breath, the salty scent of the ocean fills his nostrils, making him feel alive and refreshed.</p><p>For Taiga, this spot marks the beginning of a thrilling adventure. He’s embarking on a mission to document the captivating essence of Japan’s abandoned places. Ever since he was a child, he has been intrigued by the tales and enigmas that surround these lonely locations. This unquenchable fascination fuels his passion to photograph them all. Taiga’s ultimate goal is to create a portfolio that captures the haunting allure of these forgotten sites, and to bring to light the concealed stories and poignant memories that lie hidden within their walls.</p><p>But, as he stands there, his gaze fixed on the breathtaking scenery before him, he’s suddenly bombarded with painful memories of his past. The recollections come flooding back, threatening to overwhelm him, and pull him down into a dark pit of despair. He remembers the fear and uncertainty he faced in the aftermath of a personal tragedy, the deep sense of loss and grief that had engulfed him. But he refuses to let these memories hold him back.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, as if to physically cast them away, determined to keep moving forward. He has to keep moving forward, to find the beauty and hope in the midst of the ruins.</p><p>As Taiga turns to head back, he catches a glimpse of something moving in the corner of his eye. Curiosity getting the better of him, he turns around to see a figure shrouded in a long coat, standing just a few feet away from him. The stranger’s gaze is fixed intently upon him, making Taiga feel slightly uneasy.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Taiga asks, a note of caution in his voice.</p><p>The figure steps forward, revealing himself to be a man in his mid-twenties, around the same age as him, with sharp features and dark hair. “I was just curious,” the man says, his voice low and smooth. “I’ve seen you around, taking pictures of the town. I was wondering what you were up to.”</p><p>Taiga hesitates, unsure whether to trust this stranger. But something in the man’s gaze reassures him, and he finds himself relaxing a little. “I’m a photographer,” he says. “I’m traveling around Japan, taking pictures of abandoned places.”</p><p>The man raises an eyebrow. “Abandoned places? That’s an interesting choice.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of these forgotten places. There’s something haunting and melancholy about them.”</p><p>The man nods, his eyes still fixed on Taiga’s face. “I see. Well, looks like I’ll be seeing you around more often.”</p><p>Taiga frowns, not understanding. “Do you take pictures, too?”</p><p>The man smiles enigmatically. “Not really. But I <em>do </em>travel around the country’s abandoned places, too. For a necessary job.”</p><p>Taiga stares at the stranger. “What job is that?”</p><p>The man shrugs. “I should get going. Be careful, by the way. Not everything in these abandoned places is what it seems.”</p><p>With that, he turns and disappears into the shadows, leaving Taiga standing alone on the hill, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As Hokuto arrives at his next destination, he finds himself standing before an eerie sight: an abandoned love hotel nestled in the heart of a tranquil countryside in Chiba. The dilapidated structure stands in stark contrast to the serene surroundings, with its faded facade and broken windows hinting at its former grandeur.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine why anyone would build a love hotel in such a remote location. Most of the residents have passed away, their homes now empty and forgotten, while those who remain have fled to the bustling city in search of a better life.</p><p>As Hokuto ventures closer to the abandoned love hotel, he notices that the once-glitzy exterior has been reduced to a forlorn shell of its former self. The bright neon lights that once adorned the building have long since flickered out, their shattered remains scattered across the ground. The colorful wallpaper that once adorned the walls has now peeled away, leaving behind a patchwork of faded hues. The rooms, now barren and neglected, are covered in a thick layer of dust and debris, with cracked and crumbling structures.</p><p>Hokuto peers inside the rooms and sees that some of the drawers have been ransacked, the belongings of the previous occupants long since taken away. The silence that hangs in the air is deafening, a poignant reminder of the hotel’s forgotten past.</p><p>He pulls out his trusty compass, the needle swinging to a stop as it points resolutely towards the north. With a glance at the peeling signage adorning the walls of the abandoned love hotel, he knows that his destination lies within what used to be the event hall.</p><p>The once-grand hall is now a shadow of its former self, with crumbling walls and a decaying roof that barely shields the interior from the elements. As he steps inside, the musty smell of neglect and decay assails his nostrils. Sunlight filters in through cracks in the roof, casting a dim light on the debris that litters the ground. Hokuto knows that what he seeks lies somewhere amidst the chaos of broken chairs, overturned tables, and tattered curtains that hang limply from the walls.</p><p>Hokuto’s footsteps come to an abrupt halt as he hears a sudden noise, the sound of a camera shutter clicking. Memories of a man he had met in an abandoned town a few days ago come flooding back to him.</p><p>Fear grips Hokuto’s heart. He knows he needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid disaster. He picks up his pace, his feet pounding against the dusty ground as he hurries towards the hall.</p><p>Breathless and heart pounding, Hokuto finally reaches the event hall’s French doors. He sees the man he had feared standing in front of a dusty table, peering down at something. The man had just set down his camera, and Hokuto can’t help but wonder what he had been photographing.</p><p>The table is covered in a thick layer of dust, and Hokuto’s can't help but feel a sense of foreboding as he takes in the scene before him. Something catches his eye, a Bell telephone that seems out of place amidst the debris. He can sense that there is something significant about it, and his curiosity is piqued. He approaches the table slowly, careful not to alert the stranger to his presence. His eyes fixate on the telephone, wondering what secrets it might hold.</p><p>The man reaches for the telephone, and —</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The man’s shoulders tense, and he looks around, jumping away from the telephone. His eyes widen in recognition. “You …” he begins. “From before …?”</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Don’t pick that up.” He rushes toward the table and slightly pushes the man away. He looks at it at every angle before sighing in relief. Nothing seems to have been touched.</p><p>“What’s going on?” the man asks, voice laced with curiosity.</p><p>“You almost caused a disaster.” Hokuto didn’t mean to sound harsh, but he’s doing his job. And the last thing he wants is to screw up. His grandfather wouldn’t allow him.</p><p>The man scoffs. “A disaster? What do you mean?”</p><p>Hokuto doesn’t answer that. He looks at the pair of French doors and nods.</p><p>“Um, hello?” his companion demands. “Don’t just ignore me. I’ve seen you at the last town, and you wouldn’t explain what you’re doing here.” He gasps. “Don’t tell me you’ve been stalking me?”</p><p>Hokuto’s mind races as he tries to make sense of the situation before him. He knows that he needs to deal with the stranger eventually, but for now, he has more pressing matters to attend to.</p><p>He takes out a key and closes his eyes, taking a deep breath before reciting a quiet incantation. He concentrates on the energy that once filled the abandoned love hotel, trying to sense the spirits of those who had sought refuge there. He feels the presence of the former staff, their energy still lingering in the air. He senses the memories of those who had come to escape the world for a few hours, leaving their troubles behind.</p><p>Hokuto can feel their stories, their joys, and their sorrows, all imprinted on the walls and the furniture of the forgotten place. It’s a bittersweet feeling, a mix of nostalgia and sadness, knowing that these moments will never be relived. But for Hokuto, it’s a reminder of why he does what he does, a reminder of the importance of preserving the memories of places that have been left behind.</p><p>“I return them to you,” he declares, jabbing the key in the hole and turning it. The lock makes a clicking sound, telling him that the ritual has been completed.</p><p>When it’s done, Hokuto takes a deep breath, his chest rising and falling with each intake of air. As he stands there, he looks around the empty room, feeling a sense of satisfaction and relief. The incantation had been successful, and he had prevented disaster.</p><p>In the meantime, he turns around. The man looks stunned, his eyes bulging with surprise and his face ashen. His camera, which was previously hanging loosely around his neck, now dangles precariously from his trembling fingers. The silence is deafening as they stare at each other, neither one making a move. The tension in the air is palpable, and Hokuto’s mind races, wondering what the man might do next.</p><p>“W-What was that?” he asks, voice shaking. “What were those lights? What were those voices?”</p><p>Hokuto furrows his brows. No one but their family should be able to see and hear the lights and sounds that come with closing doors. Either this man has Closer blood with him or …</p><p>“What’s your name?” he asks.</p><p>The man gulps. “Kyomoto Taiga …”</p><p>He nods. No Closer blood, so it’s the other scenario. That makes more sense. “I’m Matsumura Hokuto. And I’m a Closer.”</p>
