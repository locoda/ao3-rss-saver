<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga is standing alone on top of the hill, looking out at the serene town below. He’s holding a professional camera, all set to take some beautiful pictures. The sun is slowly setting, painting everything with a warm, golden glow. As he takes a deep breath, the salty scent of the ocean fills his nostrils, making him feel alive and refreshed.</p><p>For Taiga, this spot marks the beginning of a thrilling adventure. He’s embarking on a mission to document the captivating essence of Japan’s abandoned places. Ever since he was a child, he has been intrigued by the tales and enigmas that surround these lonely locations. This unquenchable fascination fuels his passion to photograph them all. Taiga’s ultimate goal is to create a portfolio that captures the haunting allure of these forgotten sites, and to bring to light the concealed stories and poignant memories that lie hidden within their walls.</p><p>But, as he stands there, his gaze fixed on the breathtaking scenery before him, he’s suddenly bombarded with painful memories of his past. The recollections come flooding back, threatening to overwhelm him, and pull him down into a dark pit of despair. He remembers the fear and uncertainty he faced in the aftermath of a personal tragedy, the deep sense of loss and grief that had engulfed him. But he refuses to let these memories hold him back.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, as if to physically cast them away, determined to keep moving forward. He has to keep moving forward, to find the beauty and hope in the midst of the ruins.</p><p>As Taiga turns to head back, he catches a glimpse of something moving in the corner of his eye. Curiosity getting the better of him, he turns around to see a figure shrouded in a long coat, standing just a few feet away from him. The stranger’s gaze is fixed intently upon him, making Taiga feel slightly uneasy.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Taiga asks, a note of caution in his voice.</p><p>The figure steps forward, revealing himself to be a man in his mid-twenties, around the same age as him, with sharp features and dark hair. “I was just curious,” the man says, his voice low and smooth. “I’ve seen you around, taking pictures of the town. I was wondering what you were up to.”</p><p>Taiga hesitates, unsure whether to trust this stranger. But something in the man’s gaze reassures him, and he finds himself relaxing a little. “I’m a photographer,” he says. “I’m traveling around Japan, taking pictures of abandoned places.”</p><p>The man raises an eyebrow. “Abandoned places? That’s an interesting choice.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of these forgotten places. There’s something haunting and melancholy about them.”</p><p>The man nods, his eyes still fixed on Taiga’s face. “I see. Well, looks like I’ll be seeing you around more often.”</p><p>Taiga frowns, not understanding. “Do you take pictures, too?”</p><p>The man smiles enigmatically. “Not really. But I <em>do </em>travel around the country’s abandoned places, too. For a necessary job.”</p><p>Taiga stares at the stranger. “What job is that?”</p><p>The man shrugs. “I should get going. Be careful, by the way. Not everything in these abandoned places is what it seems.”</p><p>With that, he turns and disappears into the shadows, leaving Taiga standing alone on the hill, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As Hokuto arrives at his next destination, he finds himself standing before an eerie sight: an abandoned love hotel nestled in the heart of a tranquil countryside in Chiba. The dilapidated structure stands in stark contrast to the serene surroundings, with its faded facade and broken windows hinting at its former grandeur.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine why anyone would build a love hotel in such a remote location. Most of the residents have passed away, their homes now empty and forgotten, while those who remain have fled to the bustling city in search of a better life.</p><p>As Hokuto ventures closer to the abandoned love hotel, he notices that the once-glitzy exterior has been reduced to a forlorn shell of its former self. The bright neon lights that once adorned the building have long since flickered out, their shattered remains scattered across the ground. The colorful wallpaper that once adorned the walls has now peeled away, leaving behind a patchwork of faded hues. The rooms, now barren and neglected, are covered in a thick layer of dust and debris, with cracked and crumbling structures.</p><p>Hokuto peers inside the rooms and sees that some of the drawers have been ransacked, the belongings of the previous occupants long since taken away. The silence that hangs in the air is deafening, a poignant reminder of the hotel’s forgotten past.</p><p>He pulls out his trusty compass, the needle swinging to a stop as it points resolutely towards the north. With a glance at the peeling signage adorning the walls of the abandoned love hotel, he knows that his destination lies within what used to be the event hall.</p><p>The once-grand hall is now a shadow of its former self, with crumbling walls and a decaying roof that barely shields the interior from the elements. As he steps inside, the musty smell of neglect and decay assails his nostrils. Sunlight filters in through cracks in the roof, casting a dim light on the debris that litters the ground. Hokuto knows that what he seeks lies somewhere amidst the chaos of broken chairs, overturned tables, and tattered curtains that hang limply from the walls.</p><p>Hokuto’s footsteps come to an abrupt halt as he hears a sudden noise, the sound of a camera shutter clicking. Memories of a man he had met in an abandoned town a few days ago come flooding back to him.</p><p>Fear grips Hokuto’s heart. He knows he needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid disaster. He picks up his pace, his feet pounding against the dusty ground as he hurries towards the hall.</p><p>Breathless and heart pounding, Hokuto finally reaches the event hall’s French doors. He sees the man he had feared standing in front of a dusty table, peering down at something. The man had just set down his camera, and Hokuto can’t help but wonder what he had been photographing.</p><p>The table is covered in a thick layer of dust, and Hokuto’s can't help but feel a sense of foreboding as he takes in the scene before him. Something catches his eye, a Bell telephone that seems out of place amidst the debris. He can sense that there is something significant about it, and his curiosity is piqued. He approaches the table slowly, careful not to alert the stranger to his presence. His eyes fixate on the telephone, wondering what secrets it might hold.</p><p>The man reaches for the telephone, and —</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The man’s shoulders tense, and he looks around, jumping away from the telephone. His eyes widen in recognition. “You …” he begins. “From before …?”</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Don’t pick that up.” He rushes toward the table and slightly pushes the man away. He looks at it at every angle before sighing in relief. Nothing seems to have been touched.</p><p>“What’s going on?” the man asks, voice laced with curiosity.</p><p>“You almost caused a disaster.” Hokuto didn’t mean to sound harsh, but he’s doing his job. And the last thing he wants is to screw up. His grandfather wouldn’t allow him.</p><p>The man scoffs. “A disaster? What do you mean?”</p><p>Hokuto doesn’t answer that. He looks at the pair of French doors and nods.</p><p>“Um, hello?” his companion demands. “Don’t just ignore me. I’ve seen you at the last town, and you wouldn’t explain what you’re doing here.” He gasps. “Don’t tell me you’ve been stalking me?”</p><p>Hokuto’s mind races as he tries to make sense of the situation before him. He knows that he needs to deal with the stranger eventually, but for now, he has more pressing matters to attend to.</p><p>He takes out a key and closes his eyes, taking a deep breath before reciting a quiet incantation. He concentrates on the energy that once filled the abandoned love hotel, trying to sense the spirits of those who had sought refuge there. He feels the presence of the former staff, their energy still lingering in the air. He senses the memories of those who had come to escape the world for a few hours, leaving their troubles behind.</p><p>Hokuto can feel their stories, their joys, and their sorrows, all imprinted on the walls and the furniture of the forgotten place. It’s a bittersweet feeling, a mix of nostalgia and sadness, knowing that these moments will never be relived. But for Hokuto, it’s a reminder of why he does what he does, a reminder of the importance of preserving the memories of places that have been left behind.</p><p>“I return them to you,” he declares, jabbing the key in the hole and turning it. The lock makes a clicking sound, telling him that the ritual has been completed.</p><p>When it’s done, Hokuto takes a deep breath, his chest rising and falling with each intake of air. As he stands there, he looks around the empty room, feeling a sense of satisfaction and relief. The incantation had been successful, and he had prevented disaster.</p><p>In the meantime, he turns around. The man looks stunned, his eyes bulging with surprise and his face ashen. His camera, which was previously hanging loosely around his neck, now dangles precariously from his trembling fingers. The silence is deafening as they stare at each other, neither one making a move. The tension in the air is palpable, and Hokuto’s mind races, wondering what the man might do next.</p><p>“W-What was that?” he asks, voice shaking. “What were those lights? What were those voices?”</p><p>Hokuto furrows his brows. No one but their family should be able to see and hear the lights and sounds that come with closing doors. Either this man has Closer blood with him or …</p><p>“What’s your name?” he asks.</p><p>The man gulps. “Kyomoto Taiga …”</p><p>He nods. No Closer blood, so it’s the other scenario. That makes more sense. “I’m Matsumura Hokuto. And I’m a Closer.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga has the same dream almost every day.</p><p>It begins with darkness and the feeling of being trapped. Taiga tries to move around, but he can’t. There’s a small hole close to him that shows sunlight, but it barely gives him any comfort. He winces and sobs as he feels a sharp pain across his leg. His whole body feels wet, and he hears the dripping of water from wherever he is right now.</p><p>“Help!” he cries to someone … anyone … but no one comes. The water level is rising, and he can feel himself choking for air.</p><p>The ground shakes around him, someone screams, and a large wave covers the hole, water rushing and blurring his vision —</p><p>Taiga screams and he sits up in cold sweat. He heaves in an out, as if gulping in oxygen like he had just drowned. He closes his eyes and tries to slow his breathing, reminding himself that the dangers of the past won’t come back to him.</p><p>At least, physically.</p><p>He opens his eyes again and remembers that he’s in a small hotel room. He’s not at home — he’s in Saitama, in a guesthouse owned by an acquaintance in college. Taiga sighs heavily and gets up, his legs shaking. He ignores the scar on his leg.</p><p>Taiga slides open the balcony doors and steps out, immediately calming down thanks to the cool breeze against his face. He looks around the green mountains before his gaze stops on his destination for the day. His acquaintance told him a mining village lies there, abandoned by its villagers because mining wasn’t profitable anymore.</p><p>At the back of his mind, he wonders if there is a door that’s left unlocked …</p><p>His mind flashes back to his encounter with Matsumura Hokuto, the man he had met in two forgotten places and had introduced himself as a Closer. On their way out of the abandoned love hotel in Chiba, Hokuto had explained that Closer is a duty passed on to their family. It involves going around the country to close doors that hosts supernatural “worms” that cause the strongest earthquakes. It’s Hokuto’s job to make sure that those doors remain closed and that the Keystones — the things that contain te worms — stay in place.</p><p>Taiga had seen the sparkling purple lights, had heard the voices of … souls … that used to inhabit the place. Hokuto looked surprised himself that Taiga could see and hear things that only he and his family should be privy to. Hokuto had told him only his family could possess these abilities.</p><p>Or …</p><p>“You were close to death at one point in your life.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Taiga mumbles just as his phone vibrates. He reaches for his phone and finds a message from his cousin, Shintaro. Well, he’s almost a younger brother now.</p><p>A smile springs to his face as he reads Shintaro’s message. It’s a long update of what he has been up to. The summer vacation is about to end, and Shintaro is wrapping up his tutoring session with some grade-schooler. Shintaro also mentions a girl he’s been seeing.</p><p>And as always, the message ends with the usual invitation to come back home.</p><p>For almost two decades, home to Taiga was in Tokyo, in a crammed apartment shared with the Morimoto family. While Taiga is grateful for his aunt, uncle, and cousins’ hospitality, Taiga had always longed for his real home, a home he could never go back to. At least for now.</p><p>“Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga blinks, and he looks down at the balcony. There, at the guesthouse’s back garden, Matsumura Hokuto is looking up at him, bag already slung over his shoulders.</p><p>“It seems like we’re going to the same destination,” he says, his expression neutral. “Ready to go?”</p><p>“Give me 30 minutes,” Taiga says, face reddening. He realizes that he’s still in his pajamas and he hasn’t had breakfast. And based on experience from the past two destinations, he’s going to need a lot of energy for the walk ahead.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To his surprise, Hokuto is waiting for him inside a black GT86. He pulls down the windows and grins at him. “Hop in,” he says.</p><p>“I don’t remember seeing this car in Chiba,” Taiga mentions as he hops inside and puts on the seatbelt. Not that he’s complaining.</p><p>“That’s because I parked this in the guesthouse.” Hokuto starts the engine. “I’m not some lone traveler who prefers public transportation all the time. Having a car is much more practical.”</p><p>“You’re not following your ancestors’ footsteps that way,” Taiga points out.</p><p>Hokuto laughs at that. “They wouldn’t be mad at me,” he remarks as he drives out of the guesthouse entrance. “The world they knew is not the world I now know. The only similarity is our duty to make sure this country is safe.”</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay with me tagging along?” Taiga asks.</p><p>“You need abandoned places to photograph, right? I’m going to abandoned places, too. It’s more convenient.”</p><p>“I could help pay for gas,” Taiga offers.</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “It’s fine. My family gave me more than enough for this mission. Let’s make the most of their generosity.”</p><p>The rest of their drive is quiet, Taiga looking out at the window while Hokuto navigates the road. He wonders if he should have brought his own car for this project. But then again, Shintaro had teased about his status as a “paper driver,” and Taiga is self-aware enough that he can’t do long-distance drives.</p><p>Besides, he had managed. He liked sitting in trains and buses, observing his fellow passengers, taking photographs of the views.</p><p>But having someone to drive him to the destination is fine, too.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga and Hokuto make their way through the abandoned mining village, with Hokuto leading the way. The air is thick with tension as they walk deeper into the deserted area. Taiga looks around, feeling a sense of unease as he sees the dilapidated buildings and overgrown plants that seem to swallow up the village.</p><p>“How do you know where the doors are?” Taiga asks, trying to make conversation to ease the tension.</p><p>Hokuto glances back at Taiga. “It’s a matter of trial and error,” he replies. “Most of the time, my family has gathered a list of abandoned places. Other times, I have to ask the villagers and note them down for future reference.”</p><p>As the continue walking, they eventually come across a door that is barely visible, covered by vines and moss. Hokuto approaches it it cautiously and inspects it closely.</p><p>“It’s still sealed,” he sighs with relief. “We don’t have to worry about anything here.”</p><p>Taiga snaps some photos of the abandoned village while Hokuto monitors the door. He wonders why a place like this had been abandoned and forgotten. He feels a pang in his chest as he remembers home.</p><p>“Why do you think places like this are abandoned?” Taiga asks, looking over at Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto sighs, his gaze still fixed on the door. “The locals told me that mining was no longer profitable in the area,” he replies. “The ones who stayed grew old, while the others who left thought it would be better to move to the city.”</p><p>“But why abandon this place? It could have been something else.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s because people don’t want to remember.”</p><p>Taiga understands. He was one of those people, too. Ironically, he chases abandoned places but wants to forget about his own tragedy.</p><p>“Kyomoto?”</p><p>He grips his camera a little too tightly before putting up a smile as he turns to Hokuto. “I got what I wanted,” he says. “We should go back, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s close to sunrise when they return to the guesthouse. They stop at the lobby before heading to their respective rooms. “I’m going to Fuefuki tomorrow,” he announces. “There’s an abandoned bowling alley there. If you still want to come with me, just let me know tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Taiga nods. “I’ll take you up on your offer,” he replies. Compared to Hokuto, his search for forgotten places is much more haphazard, with a bit of online research and some interviews with the locals. At least, Hokuto already knows where to go.</p><p>Hokuto smiles. “Okay. I should wind down before dinner. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>“Or …” Taiga hesitates. “I could join you for dinner later.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks before grinning. “Okay, then.”</p><p>Dinner between them is quiet, but Taiga doesn’t mind. A million questions run through his head about Hokuto and his duty as a Closer, but he realizes that this journey could last for a few more days. He has enough time to get to know Hokuto and what he does, so he takes his time and leaves the questions for when he’s ready to ask them.</p><p>For now, he enjoys the silent company.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>He had been traveling with Kyomoto Taiga for a couple of days now, and Hokuto is nowhere close to figuring him out.</p><p>Sure, Hokuto doesn’t deem it necessary to get to know a travel companion, and a spontaneous one at that. Hokuto merely extended an invitation to accompany him since they’ve been seeing each other in the same abandoned places anyway. And besides, Taiga now knows about what he does, so a part of him thought he could be extended the same courtesy.</p><p>All he knows is that Taiga is a photographer, and he travels around Japan to take photos of abandoned and forgotten places, the same places that Hokuto is traveling to. Hokuto had cheated and looked up Taiga online, but he’s mostly greeted with Taiga’s portfolio.</p><p>The mission of photographing abandoned places must be a new one, because Taiga’s portfolio shows places, all of them with some semblance of life and activity. Hokuto doesn’t know much about the technicalities of photography, but he can tell that there’s a story behind the photo.</p><p>But the story behind the photographer remains a mystery.</p><p>Then again, they have a long journey ahead of them. Hokuto supposes that he would learn about Kyomoto Taiga in time. He can’t rush it.</p><p>His phone beeps, notifying him that his friend Juri has sent him a message. Hokuto opens the message and laughs. It’s a photo of Juri and their college friends, a reunion of some sorts. Juri ends the message with “Free your schedule and let’s go drinking with the others next time!”</p><p>Of course, Juri doesn’t know about Hokuto’s family. It’s hard to explain what they do to anyone who doesn’t see the supernatural beings that populate the country. For everyone else, earthquakes are a natural occurrence.</p><p>It makes him wonder why he explained everything to Taiga in the first place.</p><p>He supposes it all comes back to the mystery surrounding Taiga. He doesn’t have Closer blood, yet he can see the spirits of the abandoned places. It could only mean one thing.</p><p>He had seen death at one point in his life.</p><p>There is a knock on his door. “Matsumura?” Kyomoto’s voice calls from outside. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Hokuto remembers he had asked to meet Taiga after lunch. Luckily, he’s already dressed and his bag is packed with what he needs. Still, he double-checks to see if the key is still with him. When he finds it stashed in one of his bag’s pockets, he gets up to leave.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sun is high up in the sky as Taiga and Hokuto arrive at the abandoned bowling alley. The air is crisp and cool, with a faint smell of mildew and dust that hang in the air. The bowling alley itself is a relic of a bygone era, with peeling paint on the walls and rusted machines that stand silently in the corners.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes light up as he sees the potential for some great photos, and he eagerly begins snapping shots with his camera. Hokuto is less enthusiastic. From his family notes, lots of paranormal enthusiasts tend to explore in this area and are more likely to poke around areas they shouldn’t be exploring.</p><p>He finds the door, and as expected, it is slightly ajar. Hokuto takes out his key from his bag and recites his incantation. He thinks of all the people who came and went here with their friends and their family. “I return them to you,” he says at last, jabbing the key inside the lock and turning it.</p><p>Hokuto opens his eyes when he hears the clicking sound, indicating that his job is done. He then looks at Taiga, who is just as pale as he is when Hokuto had seen him at the abandoned place in Chiba.</p><p>“You’ll get used to it,” Hokuto says, stuffing the key back in his bag. “When I first accompanied my father, the sights and sounds terrified me. But the spirits never meant any harm. They just want to be remembered.”</p><p>Taiga seems to relax at that. He lets his camera hang on its straps as he wanders around the bowling alley. Hokuto wonders if he can hear the faint echo of bowling balls hitting pins.</p><p>“Matsumura, did you ever play bowling before?” Taiga asks.</p><p>Hokuto blinks. “Yeah, back in college,” he answers. “Not really good at it, though.”</p><p>Taiga walks over to him. “I used to play with my cousin all the time. There’s a bowling alley near our neighborhood. We would come there every weekend and see who could get the most strikes. I haven’t played in years, though.”</p><p>That’s the most about Taiga that Hokuto learns over the past few days they’ve traveled together.</p><p>“I didn’t know you went to college,” Taiga remarks.</p><p>Hokuto laughs at that. “Why?” he asks. “You’d think just because I have a weird family job, I don’t have a normal childhood.”</p><p>“I guess.” Taiga’s cheeks are red.</p><p>Honestly, Hokuto thinks it’s adorable.</p>

  <p align="center">💗</p><p>The abandoned hospital stands tall and ominous in the moonlight, its windows boarded up and its brick facade crumbling with age. Weeds and vines had taken over the front courtyard, growing up around the cracked pavement and reaching toward the sky. The entrance to the hospital is barred by a rusted gate, and the heavy metal doors are locked tight.</p><p>But Taiga and Hokuto find a way in.</p><p>Once inside, Taiga is struck by the eerie silence that permeate the halls. The only sounds are the echoes of their footsteps and the occasional creak of the floorboards beneath their feet. Dust-covered medical equipment lie scattered throughout the abandoned hospital, left behind like forgotten relics of a bygone era.</p><p>At that instant, memories of the past flood his mind. He remembers the sterile smell of the hospital all those years ago, surrounded by doctors and nurses who did their best to heal his broken body. But no matter how much they tried, they couldn’t erase the pain of losing everything — <em>everyone</em> — he had ever known.</p><p>He can still feel the ground shaking beneath his feet and the sound of the waves crashing against the shores echoing in his ears.</p><p>“Kyomoto?”</p><p>Taiga exhales and opens his eyes. Hokuto is looking at him, brows furrowed in concern. He’s not in that hospital all those years ago. Not anymore. They are in a hallway lined with empty patient rooms, the air thick with the smell of decay and neglect, and a sense of foreboding hanging over them like a thick fog.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Hokuto asks, setting down his flashlight.</p><p>“Yeah …” Taiga croaks, reaching for his other arm. He didn’t realize he’s shaking. “Just not a huge fan of hospitals, that’s all.”</p><p>Hokuto’s brows remain furrowed. “We could go home,” he says. “I could take it from here tomorrow morning.”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Taiga assures him. “It was a long drive from the hotel. It’s better to get this done now.”</p><p>Hokuto looks like he’s about to protest when the ground starts to shake beneath their feet. Taiga thinks it was his imagination, but the shaking grows more violent, the walls of the hospital groaning with the strain.</p><p>“The door is open!” Hokuto exclaims, eyes wide in panic. “We have to go look for it!” He looks at Taiga. “You can stay here. Or better yet, get out of here and stay in the car! I’ll be fine on my own.”</p><p>It would be better for Taiga, he thinks. Better to be outside than in here with the floorboards groaning and creaking beneath them, the debris raining down from the ceiling as the earth shakes with increasing intensity.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Taiga says with a small voice.</p><p>Hokuto just nods tosses him the car keys. He then points his flashlight to the far end of the hallway, running toward the unknown as he avoids falling debris.</p><p>Taiga miraculously manages to escape from the hospital. He jams the keys inside the car a little too loudly and flings himself inside the car. The ground is still shaking, and he closes his eyes, imagining himself anywhere but here.</p><p>He imagines his parents in their backyard. He imagines the scorching sun beat down on their small, quaint backyard. His father brings out a large, green watermelon from the kitchen, and his mother skillfully slices the fruit into neat, triangular pieces, giving Taiga the first slice.</p><p>He imagines the three of them sitting on the shaded porch, their faces aglow with excitement as they dig into their watermelon slices. His father beams with pride as they chat and laugh —</p><p>And then the shaking stops. Taiga opens his eyes and realizes that his cheeks are wet. A sob escapes his lips as he wipes his cheek with the back of his shaky hand. He’s not at home. His parents are not there.</p><p>All he sees is darkness and an abandoned hospital.</p><p>It doesn’t take him long to recognize an approaching figure. Taiga remembers where he is and hops out of the car, rushing toward him. “Matsumura!” he sighs with relief. “Thank god you’re okay.”</p><p>When Hokuto is closer in distance, Taiga notices how he clutches at his arm and the scrapes on his face. He gasps when he sees the long sleeves of Hokuto’s shirt torn in the middle, a deep gash running down his arm and oozing blood.</p><p>“What happened?” he demands.</p><p>“The worm was persistent,” Hokuto chuckles, wincing as Taiga reaches for the injured arm and lifts it. “But I managed to seal it. The earthquake is over. We should be fine.”</p><p>“No, you’re not fine,” Taiga insists. He looks at the wound and is relieved to know that it isn’t deep. “Let’s get you to a hospital.”</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “I’m okay. It’s just a scratch.”</p><p>“It’s <em>not </em>a scratch.” Taiga glares at him. “At least let’s get this treated.”</p><p>“It’s hard to explain what happened to me.”</p><p>He has a good point. Taiga sighs. “I have a first-aid kit in my room. Let’s at least head back to the hotel.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hotel lobby is busy, with a group tour checking in for the night. With the hotel staff busy with them, Taiga and Hokuto slip through the elevators without arousing suspicion on Hokuto’s injuries.</p><p>Taiga taps his key card forcefully on the door and lets Hokuto in first. Once inside, he heads to his desk and opens his bag. He’s relieved to find that his first-aid kit is there, just as he remembers.</p><p>“Go wash that wound,” he orders as he opens the kit, figuring out what he’s supposed to do. His mother had taught him how to treat wounds, but it’s been a while.</p><p>When Hokuto emerges from the bathroom, his wound clean, Taiga instructs him to sit on the edge of the bed. Taiga takes out the sterile gauze, antiseptic wipes, and a roll of bandages and heads to Hokuto’s direction.</p><p>“How did you get this wound anyway?” Taiga asks, kneeling beside Hokuto.</p><p>“Crashed into a glass cabinet, I think.” Hokuto winces as Taiga begins to dab at the wound with the antiseptic wipe. His eyes flicker shut. “It hurts,” he mutters, his voice strained.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry,” Taiga murmurs, gently cleaning the wound. “But it’s either this or your wound getting infected.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, gritting his teeth. “You’re good at this,” he mentions.</p><p>Taiga hums as he places a sterile gauze over the wound. “Mom wa … Mom’s a nurse.” He begins to wrap the bandage around his arm, securing it tightly. “There you go. But my offer to go to the hospital still stands.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Hokuto smiles, his breathing slowing down.</p><p>Taiga manages a small smile. “Try to take it easy for a bit, okay?” He picks up the first-aid kit and heads back to the desk. “I know you have your duty to keep the country safe, but you can’t do that if you’re injured yourself.”</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p>A low growl echoes throughout the room, and Taiga turns around to see Hokuto looking at his stomach. Taiga laughs at that. “We haven’t had dinner yet,” he remarks. “I’ll get us something to eat. Unless … you want to return to your room.”</p><p>Hokuto’s cheeks are pink, and he shakes his head. “If it’s not so much of a bother, I’d like us to have dinner together.”</p><p>The hotel staff is still busy when Taiga descends to the lobby, so he decides to head to the nearby convenience store. Luckily there are still a couple of microwavable lunchboxes, so he takes a couple of them plus some drinks before heading back up again.</p><p>By the time he heads up, Hokuto is lying on the edge of his bed, sound asleep. Compared to when he’s under pressure when they visit abandoned places, this Hokuto’s expression is peaceful.</p><p>It hits Taiga how Hokuto could look so … young. Well, maybe that’s an exaggeration. By the looks of it, he and Hokuto look like they’re around the same age.</p><p>But still …</p><p>Taiga chuckles. He pushes Hokuto’s sleeping figure so that he’s completely lying on the bed. He reaches for the blanket and completely covers Hokuto with it.</p><p>He then stuffs one of the lunchboxes and drinks inside the hotel fridge before settling on the couch with his dinner. But even as he has his meal, his gaze drifts toward Hokuto’s sleeping figure.</p><p>Taiga doesn’t realize how long he has been asleep, but when he wakes up, the blanket is draped over him. He gets up, groaning at the dull ache on his neck. Hokuto is gone on the bed, and there are two lunchboxes on the trash bin.</p><p>There’s a note on his desk.</p><p>“I’m sorry I fell asleep in your room. And thanks for tending to my wound. I thought about taking it easy today, and I thought it would be a good idea to go visit some friends in Gifu. Would you like to come with me? — Matsumura”</p><p>Taiga smiles at that, wondering if it’s strange for him to fall for a note and a boyish smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As the sun rises over the eastern mountains, the village of Shirakawa is enveloped in a serene and tranquil atmosphere. The air is crisp and cool, and the leaves on the trees are starting to turn various shades of red, orange, and gold.</p><p>As they drive through the city’s quiet streets, the sound of rustling leaves and distant birdsong fills Hokuto’s ears. The mist hovers above the river, lending a dreamy quality to the scene. He can see fishermen quietly casting their lines into the water, hoping for a catch.</p><p>Hokuto glances at his companion on the passenger’s seat. Taiga’s head is leaning against the window, his eyes closed and his breathing rhythmic. Hokuto feels bad that he’s to blame for his companion’s fatigue. Before he knew it, he had fallen asleep while waiting for Taiga to buy dinner.</p><p>When Hokuto wakes up, Taiga is lying down on the couch, an arm thrown over his eyes as he sleeps. Hokuto notices how peaceful he was at that time, compared to the inner turmoil he experienced when they were inside the abandoned hospital.</p><p>His hunch is right. Kyomoto Taiga must have experienced something traumatic in the past, and hospitals have something to do with it. Maybe the earthquake caused by the worm, too, but Hokuto can’t be so sure.</p><p>Still, this isn’t something that Taiga would easily open up to anyone. Maybe he will never open up to Hokuto. But Hokuto hopes he can at least do something to comfort him.</p><p>Maybe it’s the fact that it’s just the two of them traveling together, but Hokuto is starting to feel this connection toward Taiga. But he brushes his off as a temporary thing. When all this is over, Taiga will publish his photos and Hokuto will go back to his normal life.</p><p>Hokuto starts to become familiar with the path he’s taking. “Kyomoto?” he says, using his free hand to nudge him awake. “We’re almost there.”</p><p>Taiga yawns and slowly opens his eyes. He then looks out the window and gasps. “This is beautiful!” he exclaims, eyes wide with wonder.</p><p>“Welcome to Shirakawa,” Hokuto says, focusing on the road, trying not to be distracted with the way Taiga’s eyes sparkle.</p><p>Eventually, they pass by the cluster of steep, thatched roofs that rise high into the sky like giant hands clasped in prayer. A close look at the thatched roofs would tell that they are made from thick layers of straw that are carefully woven together, while the walls are made from a lattice of wooden beams intricately woven together and held together with ropes made of straw.</p><p>Finally, Hokuto stops the car in front of one of the houses, where a tall, blonde man is chopping wood. He opens the car window. “Hey, Jesse!”</p><p>The man looks up, and his face lights up. “Hokuto?” he says. “Oh my god, you’re here!” He drops his axe and rushes toward him. “Long time no see! I almost thought you’d never keep your promise to — Who’s that?”</p><p>Hokuto turns to look at Taiga, who looks confused at the turn of events. But he manages a small wave. “Hi,” he greets.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Soon, Yugo arrives, and he is just as surprised as Jesse that he almost drops the huge tote bag he is holding. He fusses over Hokuto, complaining why Hokuto didn’t even give them a head’s up, but he and Jesse manage to pull off a feast of a lunch for all four of them.</p><p>Hokuto often checks up on Taiga, making sure he doesn’t feel out of place. He looks overwhelmed, at first, to be among two other complete strangers.</p><p>But fortunately, Jesse helps break the ice, like he always does.</p><p>“So, Kyomoto, did Hokuto force you to come with him on his solo travel?”</p><p>Taiga laughs and shakes his head. “It just so happens we’re going to the same places together,” he mentions.</p><p>“What do you do for a living, if you don’t mind me asking?” Yugo asks, refilling their tea glasses.</p><p>“I’m a photographer,” Taiga answers. “I’m planning to go to abandoned places in Japan and take photos of them.”</p><p>Jesse lets out an amazed sound. “That sounds intriguing,” he remarks. “Why abandoned places, though?”</p><p>“Well …” Taiga glances at the view from the window contemplatively. “I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of them. They have this … magic around them. Like the way nature has reclaimed the space over time.</p><p>“And besides, those places used to be alive. They have a story. And I don’t want those stories to be forgotten. They <em>shouldn’t</em> be forgotten.”</p><p>Hokuto notices how his lips turn down. He remembers Taiga’s reaction to the abandoned hospital, the way he often mutters in his sleep …</p><p>“You’re right.” Yugo smiles. “I’d love to see your photos sometime, Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga smiles, his shoulders relaxing.</p><p>“Yugo.” Jesse pats Yugo’s knee. “You should tell them about the school.”</p><p>“What school?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>“There’s this abandoned North Korean school nearby,” Yugo explains, setting down his chopsticks. “It’s on the top of the hill over there.” He juts his chin toward the direction of the view outside, and sure enough, Hokuto notices the hill in question. “I think the last batch of students graduated and then packed up and left. It’s been abandoned for a year now.”</p><p>Usually, recently abandoned places don’t have doors to them yet. Still, he glances at Taiga. “Do you want to take a look?”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “Sure. Why not?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As they approach the abandoned elementary school, Hokuto can’t help but feel a sense of unease. The once vibrant playground now lays barren, the swings rusted and still, the monkey bars creaking in the wind. Weeds had overtaken the asphalt, and the hopscotch lines had faded into oblivion.</p><p>The building itself is imposing, with its exterior now covered in ivy, and its windows boarded up with old plywood. The front door, once welcoming to eager young minds, is now locked and barred.</p><p>Hokuto approaches the gate and feels a familiar energy coursing through it. It may not be a full-fledged door for the worm just yet, but it’s starting to be one. Just to be sure, he touches the lock and is relieved to know that it’s not fully formed yet.</p><p>“No doors need to lock?” Taiga asks.</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head as he takes a step backward. “I’m not needed here,” he says. “How about you?”</p><p>Taiga has his camera out. “I’m done taking photos of the exterior. Maybe I could head inside …”</p><p>“There’s probably a door at the back,” Hokuto guesses.</p><p>They make their way around to the side of the building, and they find the back entrance that would lead them inside. As Hokuto follows Taiga as he takes photos, he sees the remnants of what had once been a lively classroom. Old desks, books, and chalkboards lay abandoned, as if the students and teachers had vanished into thin air.</p><p>As they venture further into the school, the air grows musty and stale, and the sound of their footsteps echo off the walls. The silence is eerie, broken only by the occasional creaking of the floorboards beneath their feet.</p><p>“Matsumura?” Taiga speaks up.</p><p>“Hmm?” Hokuto asks. By then, they had reached the top of the building.</p><p>Taiga opens the door leading to the rooftop. “Yugo and Jesse know about what you do?” he asks.</p><p>“Yes.” Hokuto nods. “Yugo’s family is part of our family’s network. They document all abandoned places in their prefecture, and they relay the information to our family. They could go to the place to make sure that the door stays locked, but they can’t seal the doors. That’s our family’s job.”</p><p>“And Jesse?”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles at that. “Jesse is a friend from middle school,” he replies. “I introduced him to Yugo, and I guess the two have been inseparable ever since.”</p><p>“Must be nice …” Taiga leans against the railing as they stare at the view of the village from the rooftop. “To have someone by your side like that.”</p><p>Hokuto envies Yugo and Jesse, too. When the two first met, Yugo clearly wasn’t interested in Jesse. But Jesse was persistent and had shown that his feelings toward Yugo are genuine. The two had been living together ever since.</p><p>“Don’t you have someone waiting for you back home?” Hokuto asks, standing next to Taiga.</p><p>Taiga chuckles and shakes his head. “I don’t want anyone to wait for me,” he says. “I want someone to be by my side.”</p><p>Strangely enough, Hokuto feels the same. He had avoided serious relationships in college, knowing fully well that no one will understand what he does.</p><p>He looks at Taiga again as his eyes are fixed on the majestic view of the village. The breeze tousles his hair, as the last rays of sunlight cast an orange hue over the horizon.</p><p>He had never felt this way before — to be so scared yet so peaceful. It’s as if he had found something he had been looking for his own life.</p><p>Hokuto shifts next to Taiga, and their shoulders touch. He feels a jolt of electricity pass between them, and his heart pounds in his chest. For the first time in a long time, he feels hopeful. He doesn’t know what will happen when this journey is over, but for some reason, with Taiga beside him, he knows everything will be okay.</p>
