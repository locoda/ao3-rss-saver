      <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga stands alone on the hill overlooking the quiet town, his camera in hand. The sun is beginning to set, casting a golden glow over the town and the sea beyond. He takes a deep breath, the salty air filling his lungs.</p><p>This is his first stop on his journey to capture the beauty of Japan’s abandoned places. He had always been fascinated by the stories these places held, the secrets and memories that lay hidden within their crumbling walls. And he wanted to capture them all with his camera, to create something that would showcase the haunting beauty of these forgotten places.</p><p>But as he stands there, looking out over the town, memories of his own past come flooding back. Memories of the fear and uncertainty he had felt in the aftermath of his own disaster, the sense of loss and grief that had consumed him.</p><p>He shakes his head, trying to push the memories aside. He can’t let them hold him back. He has to keep moving forward, to find the beauty and hope in the midst of the ruins.</p><p>As he turns to head back, he catches a glimpse of someone out of the corner of his eye. He turns to see a figure in a long coat, standing a few feet away, watching him intently.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Taiga asks, a note of caution in his voice.</p><p>The figure steps forward, revealing himself to be a man in his mid-twenties, around the same age as him, with sharp features and dark hair. “I was just curious,” the man says, his voice low and smooth. “I’ve seen you around, taking pictures of the town. I was wondering what you were up to.”</p><p>Taiga hesitates, unsure whether to trust this stranger. But something in the man’s gaze reassures him, and he finds himself relaxing a little. “I’m a photographer,” he says. “I’m traveling around Japan, taking pictures of abandoned places.”</p><p>The man raises an eyebrow. “Abandoned places? That’s an interesting choice.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of these forgotten places. There’s something haunting and melancholy about them.”</p><p>The man nods, his eyes still fixed on Taiga’s face. “I see. Well, looks like I’ll be seeing you around more often.”</p><p>Taiga frowns, not understanding. “Do you take pictures, too?”</p><p>The man smiles enigmatically. “Not really. But I <em>do </em>travel around the country’s abandoned places, too. For a necessary job.”</p><p>Taiga stares at the stranger. “What job is that?”</p><p>The man shrugs. “I should get going. Be careful, by the way. Not everything in these abandoned places is what it seems.”</p><p>With that, he turns and disappears into the shadows, leaving Taiga standing alone on the hill, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>Hokuto arrives in his next destination, an abandoned love hotel in a quiet countryside in Chiba. One would wonder why have a love hotel here in the first place, but most of the population have passed away due to age, while others have moved to the city.</p><p>The once flashy and kitschy exterior has lost its luster. The once-vibrant lights have faded and shattered, the wallpaper peeled from the walls. The rooms are covered in dust and debris, the structures cracked and unusable. Some of the drawers have been ransacked.</p><p>Hokuto takes out his compass, and the arrow freezes north. A look at the peeling signage on the walls tells him that what he’s looking for is in what used to be the event hall.</p><p>He freezes on his tracks as he hears a sound, like the shutters of a camera. He remembers the man he met in an abandoned town a few days ago. Hokuto quickens his pace, heart hammering against his chest.</p><p>He makes it in time. The man had just set down his camera and is looking down at the dusty table next to the hall’s French doors. There’s a Bell telephone covered in dust, and Hokuto senses it’s not what it seems.</p><p>The man reaches for the telephone, and —</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The man’s shoulders tense, and he looks around, jumping away from the telephone. His eyes widen in recognition. “You …” he begins. “From before …?”</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Don’t pick that up.” He rushes toward the table and slightly pushes the man away. He looks at it at every angle before sighing in relief. Nothing seems to have been touched.</p><p>“What’s going on?” the man asks, voice laced with curiosity.</p><p>“You almost caused a disaster.” Hokuto didn’t mean to sound harsh, but he’s doing his job. And the last thing he wants is to screw up. His grandfather wouldn’t allow him.</p><p>The man scoffs. “A disaster? What do you mean?”</p><p>Hokuto doesn’t answer that. He looks at the pair of French doors and nods.</p><p>“Um, hello?” his companion demands. “Don’t just ignore me. I’ve seen you at the last town, and you wouldn’t explain what you’re doing here.” He gasps. “Don’t tell me you’ve been stalking me?”</p><p>He’ll deal with him later. For now, he takes out his key and closes his eyes. He recites his incantation and tries to feel everyone that had been here — the staff, the people who needed an escape.</p><p>“I return them to you,” he declares, jabbing the key in the hole and turning it. The lock makes a clicking sound, telling him that the ritual has been completed.</p><p>When it’s all over, Hokuto takes some time to compose himself. Closing doors are always exhausting, but it’s his duty. At least, he thinks of the people who will sleep soundly, knowing that they’re safe from harm’s way.</p><p>In the meantime, he turns around. He doesn’t expect the man to be standing there, eyes wide and face pale, as if he had seen the ghost.</p><p>“W-What was that?” he asks, voice shaking. “What were those lights? What were those voices?”</p><p>That’s odd. No one but their family should be able to see and hear the lights and sounds that come with closing doors. Either this man has Closer blood with him or …</p><p>“What’s your name?” he asks.</p><p>The man gulps. “Kyomoto Taiga …”</p><p>He nods. No Closer blood, so it’s the other scenario. That makes more sense. “I’m Matsumura Hokuto. And I’m a Closer.”</p>
