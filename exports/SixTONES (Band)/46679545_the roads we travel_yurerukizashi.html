<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga is standing alone on top of the hill, looking out at the serene town below. He’s holding a professional camera, all set to take some beautiful pictures. The sun is slowly setting, painting everything with a warm, golden glow. As he takes a deep breath, the salty scent of the ocean fills his nostrils, making him feel alive and refreshed.</p><p>For Taiga, this spot marks the beginning of a thrilling adventure. He’s embarking on a mission to document the captivating essence of Japan’s abandoned places. Ever since he was a child, he has been intrigued by the tales and enigmas that surround these lonely locations. This unquenchable fascination fuels his passion to photograph them all. Taiga’s ultimate goal is to create a portfolio that captures the haunting allure of these forgotten sites, and to bring to light the concealed stories and poignant memories that lie hidden within their walls.</p><p>But, as he stands there, his gaze fixed on the breathtaking scenery before him, he’s suddenly bombarded with painful memories of his past. The recollections come flooding back, threatening to overwhelm him, and pull him down into a dark pit of despair. He remembers the fear and uncertainty he faced in the aftermath of a personal tragedy, the deep sense of loss and grief that had engulfed him. But he refuses to let these memories hold him back.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, as if to physically cast them away, determined to keep moving forward. He has to keep moving forward, to find the beauty and hope in the midst of the ruins.</p><p>As Taiga turns to head back, he catches a glimpse of something moving in the corner of his eye. Curiosity getting the better of him, he turns around to see a figure shrouded in a long coat, standing just a few feet away from him. The stranger’s gaze is fixed intently upon him, making Taiga feel slightly uneasy.</p><p>“Can I help you?” Taiga asks, a note of caution in his voice.</p><p>The figure steps forward, revealing himself to be a man in his mid-twenties, around the same age as him, with sharp features and dark hair. “I was just curious,” the man says, his voice low and smooth. “I’ve seen you around, taking pictures of the town. I was wondering what you were up to.”</p><p>Taiga hesitates, unsure whether to trust this stranger. But something in the man’s gaze reassures him, and he finds himself relaxing a little. “I’m a photographer,” he says. “I’m traveling around Japan, taking pictures of abandoned places.”</p><p>The man raises an eyebrow. “Abandoned places? That’s an interesting choice.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of these forgotten places. There’s something haunting and melancholy about them.”</p><p>The man nods, his eyes still fixed on Taiga’s face. “I see. Well, looks like I’ll be seeing you around more often.”</p><p>Taiga frowns, not understanding. “Do you take pictures, too?”</p><p>The man smiles enigmatically. “Not really. But I <em>do </em>travel around the country’s abandoned places, too. For a necessary job.”</p><p>Taiga stares at the stranger. “What job is that?”</p><p>The man shrugs. “I should get going. Be careful, by the way. Not everything in these abandoned places is what it seems.”</p><p>With that, he turns and disappears into the shadows, leaving Taiga standing alone on the hill, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>As Hokuto arrives at his next destination, he finds himself standing before an eerie sight: an abandoned love hotel nestled in the heart of a tranquil countryside in Chiba. The dilapidated structure stands in stark contrast to the serene surroundings, with its faded facade and broken windows hinting at its former grandeur.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine why anyone would build a love hotel in such a remote location. Most of the residents have passed away, their homes now empty and forgotten, while those who remain have fled to the bustling city in search of a better life.</p><p>As Hokuto ventures closer to the abandoned love hotel, he notices that the once-glitzy exterior has been reduced to a forlorn shell of its former self. The bright neon lights that once adorned the building have long since flickered out, their shattered remains scattered across the ground. The colorful wallpaper that once adorned the walls has now peeled away, leaving behind a patchwork of faded hues. The rooms, now barren and neglected, are covered in a thick layer of dust and debris, with cracked and crumbling structures.</p><p>Hokuto peers inside the rooms and sees that some of the drawers have been ransacked, the belongings of the previous occupants long since taken away. The silence that hangs in the air is deafening, a poignant reminder of the hotel’s forgotten past.</p><p>He pulls out his trusty compass, the needle swinging to a stop as it points resolutely towards the north. With a glance at the peeling signage adorning the walls of the abandoned love hotel, he knows that his destination lies within what used to be the event hall.</p><p>The once-grand hall is now a shadow of its former self, with crumbling walls and a decaying roof that barely shields the interior from the elements. As he steps inside, the musty smell of neglect and decay assails his nostrils. Sunlight filters in through cracks in the roof, casting a dim light on the debris that litters the ground. Hokuto knows that what he seeks lies somewhere amidst the chaos of broken chairs, overturned tables, and tattered curtains that hang limply from the walls.</p><p>Hokuto’s footsteps come to an abrupt halt as he hears a sudden noise, the sound of a camera shutter clicking. Memories of a man he had met in an abandoned town a few days ago come flooding back to him.</p><p>Fear grips Hokuto’s heart. He knows he needs to move quickly if he wants to avoid disaster. He picks up his pace, his feet pounding against the dusty ground as he hurries towards the hall.</p><p>Breathless and heart pounding, Hokuto finally reaches the event hall’s French doors. He sees the man he had feared standing in front of a dusty table, peering down at something. The man had just set down his camera, and Hokuto can’t help but wonder what he had been photographing.</p><p>The table is covered in a thick layer of dust, and Hokuto’s can't help but feel a sense of foreboding as he takes in the scene before him. Something catches his eye, a Bell telephone that seems out of place amidst the debris. He can sense that there is something significant about it, and his curiosity is piqued. He approaches the table slowly, careful not to alert the stranger to his presence. His eyes fixate on the telephone, wondering what secrets it might hold.</p><p>The man reaches for the telephone, and —</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The man’s shoulders tense, and he looks around, jumping away from the telephone. His eyes widen in recognition. “You …” he begins. “From before …?”</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Don’t pick that up.” He rushes toward the table and slightly pushes the man away. He looks at it at every angle before sighing in relief. Nothing seems to have been touched.</p><p>“What’s going on?” the man asks, voice laced with curiosity.</p><p>“You almost caused a disaster.” Hokuto didn’t mean to sound harsh, but he’s doing his job. And the last thing he wants is to screw up. His grandfather wouldn’t allow him.</p><p>The man scoffs. “A disaster? What do you mean?”</p><p>Hokuto doesn’t answer that. He looks at the pair of French doors and nods.</p><p>“Um, hello?” his companion demands. “Don’t just ignore me. I’ve seen you at the last town, and you wouldn’t explain what you’re doing here.” He gasps. “Don’t tell me you’ve been stalking me?”</p><p>Hokuto’s mind races as he tries to make sense of the situation before him. He knows that he needs to deal with the stranger eventually, but for now, he has more pressing matters to attend to.</p><p>He takes out a key and closes his eyes, taking a deep breath before reciting a quiet incantation. He concentrates on the energy that once filled the abandoned love hotel, trying to sense the spirits of those who had sought refuge there. He feels the presence of the former staff, their energy still lingering in the air. He senses the memories of those who had come to escape the world for a few hours, leaving their troubles behind.</p><p>Hokuto can feel their stories, their joys, and their sorrows, all imprinted on the walls and the furniture of the forgotten place. It’s a bittersweet feeling, a mix of nostalgia and sadness, knowing that these moments will never be relived. But for Hokuto, it’s a reminder of why he does what he does, a reminder of the importance of preserving the memories of places that have been left behind.</p><p>“I return them to you,” he declares, jabbing the key in the hole and turning it. The lock makes a clicking sound, telling him that the ritual has been completed.</p><p>When it’s done, Hokuto takes a deep breath, his chest rising and falling with each intake of air. As he stands there, he looks around the empty room, feeling a sense of satisfaction and relief. The incantation had been successful, and he had prevented disaster.</p><p>In the meantime, he turns around. The man looks stunned, his eyes bulging with surprise and his face ashen. His camera, which was previously hanging loosely around his neck, now dangles precariously from his trembling fingers. The silence is deafening as they stare at each other, neither one making a move. The tension in the air is palpable, and Hokuto’s mind races, wondering what the man might do next.</p><p>“W-What was that?” he asks, voice shaking. “What were those lights? What were those voices?”</p><p>Hokuto furrows his brows. No one but their family should be able to see and hear the lights and sounds that come with closing doors. Either this man has Closer blood with him or …</p><p>“What’s your name?” he asks.</p><p>The man gulps. “Kyomoto Taiga …”</p><p>He nods. No Closer blood, so it’s the other scenario. That makes more sense. “I’m Matsumura Hokuto. And I’m a Closer.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="center">💗</p><p>Taiga has the same dream almost every day.</p><p>It begins with darkness and the feeling of being trapped. Taiga tries to move around, but he can’t. There’s a small hole close to him that shows sunlight, but it barely gives him any comfort. He winces and sobs as he feels a sharp pain across his leg. His whole body feels wet, and he hears the dripping of water from wherever he is right now.</p><p>“Help!” he cries to someone … anyone … but no one comes. The water level is rising, and he can feel himself choking for air.</p><p>The ground shakes around him, someone screams, and a large wave covers the hole, water rushing and blurring his vision —</p><p>Taiga screams and he sits up in cold sweat. He heaves in an out, as if gulping in oxygen like he had just drowned. He closes his eyes and tries to slow his breathing, reminding himself that the dangers of the past won’t come back to him.</p><p>At least, physically.</p><p>He opens his eyes again and remembers that he’s in a small hotel room. He’s not at home — he’s in Saitama, in a guesthouse owned by an acquaintance in college. Taiga sighs heavily and gets up, his legs shaking. He ignores the scar on his leg.</p><p>Taiga slides open the balcony doors and steps out, immediately calming down thanks to the cool breeze against his face. He looks around the green mountains before his gaze stops on his destination for the day. His acquaintance told him a mining village lies there, abandoned by its villagers because mining wasn’t profitable anymore.</p><p>At the back of his mind, he wonders if there is a door that’s left unlocked …</p><p>His mind flashes back to his encounter with Matsumura Hokuto, the man he had met in two forgotten places and had introduced himself as a Closer. On their way out of the abandoned love hotel in Chiba, Hokuto had explained that Closer is a duty passed on to their family. It involves going around the country to close doors that hosts supernatural “worms” that cause the strongest earthquakes. It’s Hokuto’s job to make sure that those doors remain closed and that the Keystones — the things that contain te worms — stay in place.</p><p>Taiga had seen the sparkling purple lights, had heard the voices of … souls … that used to inhabit the place. Hokuto looked surprised himself that Taiga could see and hear things that only he and his family should be privy to. Hokuto had told him only his family could possess these abilities.</p><p>Or …</p><p>“You were close to death at one point in your life.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Taiga mumbles just as his phone vibrates. He reaches for his phone and finds a message from his cousin, Shintaro. Well, he’s almost a younger brother now.</p><p>A smile springs to his face as he reads Shintaro’s message. It’s a long update of what he has been up to. The summer vacation is about to end, and Shintaro is wrapping up his tutoring session with some grade-schooler. Shintaro also mentions a girl he’s been seeing.</p><p>And as always, the message ends with the usual invitation to come back home.</p><p>For almost two decades, home to Taiga was in Tokyo, in a crammed apartment shared with the Morimoto family. While Taiga is grateful for his aunt, uncle, and cousins’ hospitality, Taiga had always longed for his real home, a home he could never go back to. At least for now.</p><p>“Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga blinks, and he looks down at the balcony. There, at the guesthouse’s back garden, Matsumura Hokuto is looking up at him, bag already slung over his shoulders.</p><p>“It seems like we’re going to the same destination,” he says, his expression neutral. “Ready to go?”</p><p>“Give me 30 minutes,” Taiga says, face reddening. He realizes that he’s still in his pajamas and he hasn’t had breakfast. And based on experience from the past two destinations, he’s going to need a lot of energy for the walk ahead.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To his surprise, Hokuto is waiting for him inside a black GT86. He pulls down the windows and grins at him. “Hop in,” he says.</p><p>“I don’t remember seeing this car in Chiba,” Taiga mentions as he hops inside and puts on the seatbelt. Not that he’s complaining.</p><p>“That’s because I parked this in the guesthouse.” Hokuto starts the engine. “I’m not some lone traveler who prefers public transportation all the time. Having a car is much more practical.”</p><p>“You’re not following your ancestors’ footsteps that way,” Taiga points out.</p><p>Hokuto laughs at that. “They wouldn’t be mad at me,” he remarks as he drives out of the guesthouse entrance. “The world they knew is not the world I now know. The only similarity is our duty to make sure this country is safe.”</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay with me tagging along?” Taiga asks.</p><p>“You need abandoned places to photograph, right? I’m going to abandoned places, too. It’s more convenient.”</p><p>“I could help pay for gas,” Taiga offers.</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “It’s fine. My family gave me more than enough for this mission. Let’s make the most of their generosity.”</p><p>The rest of their drive is quiet, Taiga looking out at the window while Hokuto navigates the road. He wonders if he should have brought his own car for this project. But then again, Shintaro had teased about his status as a “paper driver,” and Taiga is self-aware enough that he can’t do long-distance drives.</p><p>Besides, he had managed. He liked sitting in trains and buses, observing his fellow passengers, taking photographs of the views.</p><p>But having someone to drive him to the destination is fine, too.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga and Hokuto make their way through the abandoned mining village, with Hokuto leading the way. The air is thick with tension as they walk deeper into the deserted area. Taiga looks around, feeling a sense of unease as he sees the dilapidated buildings and overgrown plants that seem to swallow up the village.</p><p>“How do you know where the doors are?” Taiga asks, trying to make conversation to ease the tension.</p><p>Hokuto glances back at Taiga. “It’s a matter of trial and error,” he replies. “Most of the time, my family has gathered a list of abandoned places. Other times, I have to ask the villagers and note them down for future reference.”</p><p>As the continue walking, they eventually come across a door that is barely visible, covered by vines and moss. Hokuto approaches it it cautiously and inspects it closely.</p><p>“It’s still sealed,” he sighs with relief. “We don’t have to worry about anything here.”</p><p>Taiga snaps some photos of the abandoned village while Hokuto monitors the door. He wonders why a place like this had been abandoned and forgotten. He feels a pang in his chest as he remembers home.</p><p>“Why do you think places like this are abandoned?” Taiga asks, looking over at Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto sighs, his gaze still fixed on the door. “The locals told me that mining was no longer profitable in the area,” he replies. “The ones who stayed grew old, while the others who left thought it would be better to move to the city.”</p><p>“But why abandon this place? It could have been something else.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s because people don’t want to remember.”</p><p>Taiga understands. He was one of those people, too. Ironically, he chases abandoned places but wants to forget about his own tragedy.</p><p>“Kyomoto?”</p><p>He grips his camera a little too tightly before putting up a smile as he turns to Hokuto. “I got what I wanted,” he says. “We should go back, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s close to sunrise when they return to the guesthouse. They stop at the lobby before heading to their respective rooms. “I’m going to Fuefuki tomorrow,” he announces. “There’s an abandoned bowling alley there. If you still want to come with me, just let me know tomorrow morning.”</p><p>Taiga nods. “I’ll take you up on your offer,” he replies. Compared to Hokuto, his search for forgotten places is much more haphazard, with a bit of online research and some interviews with the locals. At least, Hokuto already knows where to go.</p><p>Hokuto smiles. “Okay. I should wind down before dinner. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>“Or …” Taiga hesitates. “I could join you for dinner later.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks before grinning. “Okay, then.”</p><p>Dinner between them is quiet, but Taiga doesn’t mind. A million questions run through his head about Hokuto and his duty as a Closer, but he realizes that this journey could last for a few more days. He has enough time to get to know Hokuto and what he does, so he takes his time and leaves the questions for when he’s ready to ask them.</p><p>For now, he enjoys the silent company.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤</p><p>He had been traveling with Kyomoto Taiga for a couple of days now, and Hokuto is nowhere close to figuring him out.</p><p>Sure, Hokuto doesn’t deem it necessary to get to know a travel companion, and a spontaneous one at that. Hokuto merely extended an invitation to accompany him since they’ve been seeing each other in the same abandoned places anyway. And besides, Taiga now knows about what he does, so a part of him thought he could be extended the same courtesy.</p><p>All he knows is that Taiga is a photographer, and he travels around Japan to take photos of abandoned and forgotten places, the same places that Hokuto is traveling to. Hokuto had cheated and looked up Taiga online, but he’s mostly greeted with Taiga’s portfolio.</p><p>The mission of photographing abandoned places must be a new one, because Taiga’s portfolio shows places, all of them with some semblance of life and activity. Hokuto doesn’t know much about the technicalities of photography, but he can tell that there’s a story behind the photo.</p><p>But the story behind the photographer remains a mystery.</p><p>Then again, they have a long journey ahead of them. Hokuto supposes that he would learn about Kyomoto Taiga in time. He can’t rush it.</p><p>His phone beeps, notifying him that his friend Juri has sent him a message. Hokuto opens the message and laughs. It’s a photo of Juri and their college friends, a reunion of some sorts. Juri ends the message with “Free your schedule and let’s go drinking with the others next time!”</p><p>Of course, Juri doesn’t know about Hokuto’s family. It’s hard to explain what they do to anyone who doesn’t see the supernatural beings that populate the country. For everyone else, earthquakes are a natural occurrence.</p><p>It makes him wonder why he explained everything to Taiga in the first place.</p><p>He supposes it all comes back to the mystery surrounding Taiga. He doesn’t have Closer blood, yet he can see the spirits of the abandoned places. It could only mean one thing.</p><p>He had seen death at one point in his life.</p><p>There is a knock on his door. “Matsumura?” Kyomoto’s voice calls from outside. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Hokuto remembers he had asked to meet Taiga after lunch. Luckily, he’s already dressed and his bag is packed with what he needs. Still, he double-checks to see if the key is still with him. When he finds it stashed in one of his bag’s pockets, he gets up to leave.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sun is high up in the sky as Taiga and Hokuto arrive at the abandoned bowling alley. The air is crisp and cool, with a faint smell of mildew and dust that hang in the air. The bowling alley itself is a relic of a bygone era, with peeling paint on the walls and rusted machines that stand silently in the corners.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes light up as he sees the potential for some great photos, and he eagerly begins snapping shots with his camera. Hokuto is less enthusiastic. From his family notes, lots of paranormal enthusiasts tend to explore in this area and are more likely to poke around areas they shouldn’t be exploring.</p><p>He finds the door, and as expected, it is slightly ajar. Hokuto takes out his key from his bag and recites his incantation. He thinks of all the people who came and went here with their friends and their family. “I return them to you,” he says at last, jabbing the key inside the lock and turning it.</p><p>Hokuto opens his eyes when he hears the clicking sound, indicating that his job is done. He then looks at Taiga, who is just as pale as he is when Hokuto had seen him at the abandoned place in Chiba.</p><p>“You’ll get used to it,” Hokuto says, stuffing the key back in his bag. “When I first accompanied my father, the sights and sounds terrified me. But the spirits never meant any harm. They just want to be remembered.”</p><p>Taiga seems to relax at that. He lets his camera hang on its straps as he wanders around the bowling alley. Hokuto wonders if he can hear the faint echo of bowling balls hitting pins.</p><p>“Matsumura, did you ever play bowling before?” Taiga asks.</p><p>Hokuto blinks. “Yeah, back in college,” he answers. “Not really good at it, though.”</p><p>Taiga walks over to him. “I used to play with my cousin all the time. There’s a bowling alley near our neighborhood. We would come there every weekend and see who could get the most strikes. I haven’t played in years, though.”</p><p>That’s the most about Taiga that Hokuto learns over the past few days they’ve traveled together.</p><p>“I didn’t know you went to college,” Taiga remarks.</p><p>Hokuto laughs at that. “Why?” he asks. “You’d think just because I have a weird family job, I don’t have a normal childhood.”</p><p>“I guess.” Taiga’s cheeks are red.</p><p>Honestly, Hokuto thinks it’s adorable.</p>
