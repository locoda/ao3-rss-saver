<div class="userstuff">
<p>The dark clouds that have been scattering in the sky are no longer able to support the weight of the water in them, allowing it to fall to the earth, wetting everything on the road after a long time of its absence. The flowers above the ground dance in the wind, enjoying their time as if they have been waiting for a long time. The frogs sing a happy song, adding to the comfort of the night and making the beeping sound of the clock on its desk unheard. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga walks into his room, wearing a towel on his torso and rubbing his hair with another towel. He looks at the window, seeing how dark the night sky is without stars. The lightning outside startles him, making him step back and pulling the curtain to cover it. He looks at the clock, 8 pm, and his boyfriend is still not at home.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Is he okay?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga reaches his phone that is placed beside his pillow, clicking the icon message to send a short text to his boyfriend.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<em>Kyomoto:</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>"Still busy with work?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Jesse:</em>
</p><p>
<em>Already done, but I still can't go home.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The rain was too heavy.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga pouts as he sees a crying sticker from Jesse.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<em>Kyomoto:</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>It's okay! Maybe the rain will stop soon.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga places his phone back in its place and walks towards his closet, taking out a cream colored short pants and a black t-shirt. Sleeping in this kind of clothes is the most comfortable for now. The weather is not too hot for him to sleep without a blanket, nor too cold for him to sleep wearing long-sleeved pajamas. So he picks his best and his favorite clothes, t-shirt and short pants.</p><p> </p><p>After hanging back the towel he used onto its place, Taiga throws himself and lays his back on a white comfy sheet, reaching out his phone to see the unread messages.</p><p> </p><p>His cheeks blooms in pink as he read the last message from Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jesse:</em>
</p><p>
<em>I miss you so badly :(</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He gets blush, but his heart feels empty. It's funny how they miss each other as if they haven't met for a long time whereas they have been waking up every morning in each other's arms, rubbing each other's hair after bath or drying their clothes on the rooftop while playing around, spending their time together while cooking, and doing some little things like watching a movie while linking their hands, sharing the warm feeling inside their pounding hearts. </p><p> </p><p>But Jesse would still tell him some things like <em>I miss you so much. I want to see you badly. Let's sleep together. </em></p><p> </p><p>Of course those things never fail to make Taiga blush, but he's holding his pride too high so he never tells Jesse back that he feels the same too. But Jesse never complains, he knows Taiga so well — too well that Taiga himself somehow doesn't realize it. It is clear enough, though. Because there is no way that Taiga did not miss him. There is no way that his heart did not pound because of Jesse’s words. There is no way that he did not feel the same as his boyfriend. Taiga misses him too. He has been missing him as much as Jesse misses him. If he wants to be selfish, he wants Jesse to stay with him forever. No need to work, no need to be separated. Just with him, spending their time everyday, every night, every morning, every single breath they let out from their lungs in every second. Taiga just wants to stay close to him. </p><p> </p><p>But of course Taiga can't do that. They can’t be like that. And Taiga feels too embarrassed for saying those things towards Jesse, so he keeps it inside.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<em>Kyomoto:</em>
</p><p align="right">
<em>Be careful when you go home later! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga let a chuckle escape from his lips, feeling warm over his body because of the cheerful and funny memories repeating inside his mind. Taiga closes his eyes, he just wants to close his eyes for a few minutes as he waits for Jesse's reply. But without him realizing, he fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>The rumbling sound of trees who dance happily outside makes him stirred on his bed. He pulls his blanket over his chest and turns his back to the left, curling himself like a baby and seeking any comfort and warmth beside him. But then he feels like touching a wide and warm surface in front of him. As he opens his eyes, Taiga’s brows furrow when he sees a wide chest in white t-shirt. He looks up, and meets someone’s chin above him.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesse?” he says while squinting his eyes, blinking a few times to sharpen his sight. He pulls himself away and sees Jesse’s sleeping face beside him while placing his arm under his own head to be his pillow. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga brushes his own hair and slides his hand beneath his own head. A beaming smile forms on his lips as he watches Jesse’s figure beside him. Jesse always looks handsome. His reddened-pale skin under the dim light makes him look cute, his black hair, his hard-sharpened jaw that seems relaxed, his glossy thick lips that slightly open as soft breath escapes from them. Taiga can spend his entire night admiring Jesse’s future and ignoring the rageous wind outside. His eyes blink slowly as he feels sleepiness wrapped him again. But then Jesse opens his eyes and looks up, meeting his sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi....” he whispers, smiling softly at Taiga. Taiga merely smiles and he moves his body closer towards Jesse and buries his face into the crook of his neck. Jesse slides his arm beneath Taiga and wraps him tight into an embrace. His nose nuzzles into Taiga’s brown hair, filling his lungs with his sweet scent. Taiga places his hand between their chest, covering his loud pounding heart as he closes his eyes slowly, feeling warm and comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>“When did you arrive?” he asks softly. It takes a few minutes until he gets an answer. He can feel the vibration on Jesse's voice as Jesse says, “an hour ago, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hums quietly, “Dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not yet...”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looks up to meet Jesse’s face. Trailing his thumb on Jesse’s jaw before he moves to his cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to have some?” Taiga asks softly. Jesse looks down at him and smiles, “Can I have you instead?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can feel his cheeks flutter in pink as he holds his breath, “I can’t be your dinner.’ He says while letting go of a single snort. Jesse grabs his hand, kissing his palm gently as he closes his eyes. Taiga looks at him warmly as he lets Jesse plant some kisses on his knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>“Why can't you be my dinner?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga holds his breath before he takes another breath, caressing Jesse's wide chest behind his t-shirt and says, “I can't make you full.” He swears he didn’t have any hidden meaning inside his words, but a smirk that formed on Jesse’s lips makes him realize that he might have said the keyword.</p><p> </p><p>“I can make you full.” He says teasingly. Before Taiga can complain, Jesse crashes his lips on his, keeping their lips pressed for a few moments. Taiga breaks the kiss and smiles beautifully towards him, making Jesse’s heart swell in warmth. He doesn’t have to wait to get more of Taiga’s lips as he plants another kiss on his. They move their lips slowly, enjoying the taste of peppermint and lemon on each other’s lips. The soft hum escapes from Taiga’s throat as Jesse grabs his back and pushes him gently. Bringing their bodies closer and destroying the distance between them. Jesse wants to taste more of his boyfriend as he bites Taiga’s lower lip softly, pushing his tongue inside. The soft breath and the sounds of their clashing teeth fills their ears. Taiga lets Jesse curl his tongue inside him as he grabs Jesse’s hair, shifting his body and making Jesse lay over him.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse, of course, takes it as an invitation as he moves his tongue to trail on Taiga’s milky skin. Planting some kisses on his neck, sucking him gently. Taiga lets a soft moan escape from his lips as Jesse bites his collar. Pulling down his t-shirt slightly as he wants to taste him more. Taiga cups Jesse’s cheeks, bringing him up to kiss him again.</p><p> </p><p>Their kisses are slow, soft, and gentle. Jesse never wants to be rough on Taiga. He’s very gentle and always be gentle to him. As if Taiga made from a glass, full of fragility. But Taiga himself doesn’t mind it. He takes the gentleness of Jesse as his way to express his love towards him. Even though Jesse somehow can act like a spoiled kid. Taiga doesn’t mind it. He finds it cute and he loves it.</p><p> </p><p>He just… loves him.</p><p> </p><p>He loves Jesse when he's taking care of him. He loves Jesse when he's concerned about small things. He loves Jesse when he's being a spoiled kid. He loves Jesse when he's being soft whenever they talk. He loves Jesse when he's being funny whenever Taiga needs to laugh. He loves Jesse when he becomes the light whenever Taiga enters the darkness.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga just loves Jesse so much.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse pulls up Taiga’s shirt as he trails his lips on Taiga’s belly. Moving up slowly to his chest and touching his buds. Taiga can’t help but moan again and again as Jesse plays with his buds, curling it with his fingers. He blows a soft breath to the other bud, making Taiga shiver. His back curves as he feels Jesse’s tongue on it, sucking it a few times before he moves to the other one. Taiga takes a grip on the sheet, grabbing it hard as his breath starts being heavy.</p><p> </p><p>“I always love your nips.” Jesse speaks with his low voice and plants some kisses on Taiga’s body.Taiga closes his eyes as he feels Jesse’s lips around his lower belly, caressing his shaft behind his short pants.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re hard already” Jesse says teasingly as he kisses it, making the older hisses. Jesse moves his face to Taiga’s inner thigh, kissing him and smelling his milky skin. Jesse always loves Taiga’s scent. Taiga's scent is refreshing like a fruit, but he also smells sweet like vanilla. Making Jesse want to taste him again and again. Taiga shifts his legs unintentionally, trapping Jesse between them as he licks his thigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesse...” Taiga says breathlessly. He grabs the younger’s hair, pulling him up to kiss him again as he’s already missed the taste of his lips. Their breath mingles. Their throbbing hearts fight behind their chest. Their blood starts running in their veins. Taiga looped his arms on Jesse’s neck, trapping him in front of him. Jesse breaks the kiss, gazing at his boyfriend underneath him. Taiga’s skin glowing under the dim light. His lips swollen in pink and knowing that he’s the one who caused it make Jesse’s heart thud. His eyes are full of desire. His cheeks bloomed in pink as Jesse stroked it gently with his knuckle. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s beauty is always breathtaking.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse will never be tired of it. He can spend his entire life admiring Taiga’s beauty. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse gives a long kiss on Taiga's forehead, then moving to his temples, showering him with butterfly kisses on his cheeks, his bridge of nose, his curved jawline, his chin, and up to his lips. Jesse cups Taiga's lashes gently between his mouth, making the older let an airy laugh. And he moves to Taiga's lips, smooching him softly while brushing his bangs over gently.</p><p> </p><p>"I want you… " Jesse whispers between their kisses. Taiga lets his arms hang on Jesse's wide shoulders, tilting his head as he lets Jesse taste him deeper. </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want me to say?" Taiga speaks breathlessly under Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing."</p><p> </p><p>"Just let me put this inside you." Jesse says in every kiss he landed on Taiga's face. The corner of Taiga's lips curl, signaling him that he gives him the permission. Jesse smooches his lips again as he pulls down Taiga's pants until it reaches his knees, slowly and slowly, as if he doesn't have to be rushed at all. Taiga's eyes follow Jesse's lips tracing on his body, going down bit by bit until he reaches his shaft. His breath hitches as Jesse blows a warm air onto it. Taiga brings his own hand beside him, seeking for something to be held as he feels Jesse takes him under, planting some kisses on it, holding its shaft gently as he traces his tongue around. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>It's warm, it's wet, it's hot. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga tells his feelings through his heavy breath. Jesse's tongue feels so good on him. And Taiga always loves how Jesse knows how to use his tongue well to please him, making him comfortable. A heavy breath escapes from his lips as Jesse takes him inside, playing it with his tongue as if he eats a lollipop. The slurping sounds under him makes him shiver on his spine. His back curves beautifully, and his hand grips the bedsheet, holding it tight as if his life depended on it.</p><p> </p><p>He can't help but moan louder and louder, telling Jesse that he really enjoys his tongue around him. Telling him of how good his play is and how hard it impacts him. His cock twitches inside Jesse as it touches the back of Jesse's throat, making him gag. Taiga can't help but jerk his hips slowly, fucking Jesse's face. He tightens his grip on the bed sheet, causing it to wrinkle and almost fall off its bed.</p><p> </p><p>He is close. He is getting closer as Jesse takes a deep slurp of him. But Jesse knows, he knows that Taiga will reach his peak no longer again. So he stops, pulling himself away from Taiga's shaft, leaving it wet, hard, pink and covered by his precum mixed with his own saliva. </p><p> </p><p>"You're so warm." Jesse says as he climbs on Taiga, reaching his sweaty face. He strokes Taiga's face gently with his fingers, brushing his damp hair away from his glowing skin, making him look alluring. Taiga looks at his boyfriend in haze, eyes full of lust and desire, wanting to be pleased more and more. He cups Jesse's face with his trembling hands (caused by excitement), bringing him down to reach his lips. Taiga moves his lips slowly, breathing in front of his lips, telling him without saying any words of how much he wants him, how much he loves him, and how much he admires him.</p><p> </p><p>"Please… " Taiga whispers in his smooch.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse breaks the kiss, wandering his eyes on Taiga's figure, looking for any uncomfortable hint on his face. Jesse knows how long they haven't sex and it must be <em>damn</em> painful for Taiga to take his huge cock. He just wants to make sure that he wouldn't hurt him.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure?" Jesse speaks softly while breathing on Taiga's lips. But instead of answering, Taiga takes his lips again, planting a long soft kiss on it. And Jesse, of course taking it as a <em>yes</em>. He then raises his own body, undressing himself and completely taking off Taiga's pants before reaching out the drawer beside Taiga's bed. He takes a half bottle of lube and pours it on his wide palm. He also takes a sachet of condom, tearing it using his teeth and puts it on his long shaft. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse is already hardened. Huge and hard. Taiga swallows hard as he sees the precum on Jesse's tip, holding himself not to suck him as he remembers that he wants Jesse to finish inside him. Taiga gasps as Jesse leans down and reaches his reddened swollen lips, sucking him again as if he wants more and more, forgetting that he has been eating him up and down.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moans in his throat as Jesse slowly pushes his thighs with his own knees, spreading him wide. Jesse moves his thick lips on Taiga's neck, kissing him softly in the same place that was already marked by himself earlier. Taiga trails his fingers on Jesse's back, making the younger shiver as he bites his collar again. Taiga then moves his hands on Jesse's head, grabbing his hair and massaging his scalp as Jesse moves his lips on his buds. His pink-hardened buds. Jesse nips one of them, trying to distract Taiga as he reaches his entrance slowly and poking him with his chubby finger. Taiga's grip tightens on Jesse's hair as he holds his breath, feeling Jesse's warm finger inside him. He swallows back his whimper as Jesse trails his tongue on Taiga's belly as he starts poking him again with another finger, adjusting them with Taiga's tight muscle. He then curls his fingers, stretching Taiga so he can fit inside him. Taiga's breath hitches as he feels another finger poking him again, massaging him and giving him pleasure as he hits his spot.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can't hold his whimper as Jesse presses him again and again, scratching him wide with his three chubby fingers, preparing him well before he puts his long hardened shaft inside him. His hand is busy reaching out the headboard of its bed to be held. His moan chokes as Jesse pulls his fingers out, pouring the rest of lube around him and adjusting his condomed shaft in front of his entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse looks at Taiga under him, taking his time to admire his beauty; half naked, skin glimmers because of sweat, pink and red bruises over his body. Taiga's lips slightly open as Jesse puts his cock inside him slowly while locking his eyes on him, not wanting to blink because of worries that Jesse will miss any expression on Taiga's face. He lets out a heavy breath while adjusting his position to reach Taiga any deeper. His hands hold Taiga's hip before he starts moving slowly, very slowly so that Taiga won't feel any pain. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse stops as he hears Taiga whimper, his face wrinkles and his grip tighten on his bed. Jesse reaches Taiga underneath him and strokes his face gently, landing a soft kiss on his cheek as he asks, "it hurts?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga places his hands over Jesse's cheeks and kisses him, "it's okay… " he whispers, breathing heavily as he says, "keep going… "</p><p> </p><p>Jesse moves his lips to crash on Taiga's again as he jerks his hips. Their kisses are slow, so slow to match their rhythm. Jesse keeps brushing Taiga's brown hair, stroking his face gently, showering him with his affection. Their foreheads touched, radiating warmth from their bodies. </p><p> </p><p>Under the storm outside, their heavy breath mingles and their moans and groans become unheard.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse whose name that Taiga calls in his moans and his hiss. Jesse whose name that Taiga keeps repeating under his breath like a magic spell. Jesse whose name that owns Taiga from his hair to his heel, from his body to his heart. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse buries his face on the crook of Taiga's neck as he reaches his peak. Taiga hooks his arms around Jesse, pressing him closer to him as he flies to the moon. Also reaching his peak and starting to kiss Jesse's temple as he spills his own milk over Jesse's abs. </p><p> </p><p>After coming back to earth, Jesse moves his body to lay beside him, throwing his condom on the bin and taking some tissue paper to wipe himself. He looks at his boyfriend who seems still over the moon. He smiles gently as he helps him by wiping his milk over his shaft. As he finishes, he turns his body to face his boyfriend, placing his arm over Taiga's chest and his own finger is busy caressing Taiga's face, tucking his damp hair behind his ear as Taiga tries to catch his own breath. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga turns his face towards Jesse, gazing at him with his dreamy eyes. He wipes Jesse's forehead from his own sweat, smiling warmly as he speaks, "You look so good…" </p><p> </p><p>Jesse pulls him into his embrace, shifting his body to let Taiga bury his face on his crook as he slips willingly his arm underneath him. He plants a softest kiss on Taiga's shoulder, looping his arms around him as he pulls him closer. He nuzzles his chin over Taiga's head, tightening his embrace around his lover. He pats Taiga's back gently as he speaks, "are you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath, filling his lungs with Jesse's scent. It takes a few moments for him to confirm, replying in a very low voice, "perfectly fine." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga closes his eyes as sleepiness starts to wrap him, his breath becomes steady, his heart beating normally.</p><p> </p><p>Warm, comfortable, calm, safe, and full of love.</p><p> </p><p>That is what he feels inside Jesse's embrace, feeling his heartbeat behind his hand that he slipped between them.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of soft snoring has reached Jesse's ears. He looks down at Taiga and a warm smile forms on his lips as he finds his boyfriend's sleeping face under him. He kisses him softly, warmly, showering him with his love again and again before he lets himself fall asleep above Taiga's crown.</p><p> </p><p>The chirping sound from birds reaches their ears. The sun rays peek from the window to greet them. The raindrops on the leaves fall gently to the earth, and the fresh scent after the heavy rain last night wafted from the road.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga opens his eyes slowly, finding himself laying down beside Jesse, breathing softly in front of him. He smiles softly before he pecks Jesse's lips gently and wakes him up.</p><p> </p><p>"Morning… " he greets in a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse smiles warmly, seeing his beautiful boyfriend between his lashes, reaching his cheeks and caressing it while greeting him, "Good morning, Taiga."</p><p> </p><p> </p>
