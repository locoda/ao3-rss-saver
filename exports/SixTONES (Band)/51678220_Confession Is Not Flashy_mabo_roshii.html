<p>“Alright ladies and gentlemen! It is time for the most anticipated ceremony of the year! Get ready to see who shall be bethrown to whom!”</p><p>As the stoplight hit him the ceremony master began his opening monologue that had been the same for years and years.</p><p>The people that were going to be coupled up by the end of the night were still standing in the shadows in front of the stage. Every single one of them had a spotlight fixated on them and the second their name was called the spotlight would be turned on so that the citizens back at home could see their reactions clearly on the tv. Then they would make their way up to the stage with the person chosen for them and wait until the ceremony master had spoken the last words of farewell to the audience.</p><p>“Welcome to the event of the year! We have gathered here with these youngsters that are going to turn of the age next year. All of them are going to get paired up to a person chosen by our beloved government by the end of this evening.”</p><p>“Once you hear your name, please get ready. When a set of names have been called and you have thus been paired with your partner, if you could please proceed up on to the stage. And without further ado, let's get started with announcing the future couples!”</p><p>“Nakayama Yuma.”</p><p>“Mukai Koji.”</p><p>“Kawashima Umika.”</p><p>“Morohoshi Shoki.”</p><p>The look of dissatisfaction was clear on Kawashima Umika’s face as they announced the name of her partner. Everyone knew that she had a fixation with the son of Kyomoto family and had seen him as the obvious choice for her. Morohoshi did not let that bother him as he made his way to the stage. He had not put any name down on the paper as he really had not had anyone who would have caught his fancy.</p><p>The ceremony master went on with the list.</p><p>There was just a few of them left by now as most of their names had already been called out.</p><p>“Watanabe Lisa.”</p><p>Taiga tensed for split of a second, but he was relaxed again so fast that no one noticed the change in his demeanour.</p><p>“Ieiri Leo.”</p><p>A small smile formed on Kochi’s lips as he was truly happy for her as he knew that this was exactly what she had been hoping for as the outcome.</p><p>“Kochi Yugo.”</p><p>He stood up and waited for the other name to be called.</p><p>“Kyomoto Taiga.”</p><p>Both of their faces stayed stoic as ever and seemed not to give a way any feelings that they might have at that very moment. But back at home, Jesse could tell that Kochi’s face was not as poker as it would seem to the rest of the world.</p><p>“And the last pair!”</p><p>“Nakajima Kento.”</p><p>“Watanabe Mayu.”</p><p>Kochi smiled; Nakajima Kento had actually gotten the one he had wanted. Whether Watanabe Mayu liked him or not, Kochi did not know, but nevertheless he was happy for Nakajima. He knew that all three of them were born in the same month so he hoped that they would all get well along in the future.</p><p>Taiga’s face twitched just the slightest. Kochi happened to be looking at Nakajima so he could smile at him in order to congratulate him and as Taiga was standing on that side of him, he happened to notice the change on Kyomoto’s face.</p><p>What was that about? Was Kyomoto perhaps bisexual? Did he fancy Watanabe? Or had he been paired to a straight guy? Had the system actually read his wishes, but then also gone against them by picking for him someone who could never have feelings for him?</p>
