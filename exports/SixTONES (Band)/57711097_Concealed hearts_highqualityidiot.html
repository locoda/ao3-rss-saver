<p>Hayate hurried into the room but stopped short on the doorway at the sight of a person standing there.</p><p>Kagemaru looked nervous and guilty, the tense lines of his shoulders and mouth something Hayate hadn’t seen in a long time. An incredible wave of relief washed over him at the sight of the other, directly followed with a one of anger, though. It must’ve been visible on his face as well since Kagemaru lowered his head in regret. His whole being gave out how sorry he was, and that had Hayate finally moving.</p><p>He briskly stepped to Kagemaru and – for his anger of the other not following his direct orders and going out to play a hero by himself (and making him sick with worry) – slapped him in the face. Then, for everything besides that, Hayate pulled him into a tight hug.</p><p>He felt Kagemaru tensing a bit, probably in surprise but soon he felt the other wrapping arms around him as well. Hayate closed his eyes and silently thanked the gods.</p><p>Then, at the spark of the moment and on instinct, he pulled back just a little to seek Kagemaru’s mouth with his own, covering it with biting and needy kisses, like he had wanted so much for so long already. Surprisingly, Kagemaru didn’t halt for a second but kissed him back with as much passion, taking his face between his hands and tilting his head for better angle.</p><p>Hayate pushed Kagemaru, until the other’s back hit the wall, and pressed himself tight against him. Kagemaru’s body was warm and solid and felt so good against his, and the memory of the fear of losing Kagemaru flashed through his hazy mind again, making him hold on tighter. He poured all his feelings of comradeship, affection, trust and need into the deep and heated kisses, which apparently neither of them were willing to break—</p><p>Until there was a sudden voice from downstairs that startled them and made them jump apart, both suddenly remembering where they were.</p><p>Hayate took a step back, feeling a bit dizzy and trying to catch his breath. He awkwardly rubbed his neck and was very aware of how red his face had to be; he didn’t dare to look at Kagemaru.</p><p>“Um,” Hayate said and cleared his throat. “We’ll be staying here for the night so you can just take it easy and rest for now.”</p><p>“Here?” Kagemaru sounded surprised. “Isn’t it too risky? Wouldn’t it be better to move–”</p><p>“We’ll stay,” Hayate repeated, strictly. He raised his eyes and gave a quick glance at Kagemaru. “You need to rest. We keep low profile and leave at dawn.”</p><p>With that, Hayate hurried out of the room and back downstairs, as he wasn’t at all sure he could’ve held himself back with the other so close. His lips and skin were still tingling from Kagemaru’s touch.</p>

<p>Hayate has always been strong and determined, and his presence has been very powerful to Kagemaru, ever since the first moment they met long ago. Ever since then, Kagemaru has, unconsciously at first and willfully later, relied on the other.</p><p>Hayate’s touch is already firm and supportive when they are mere pupils training to become <i>genin</i>. Whenever Kagemaru falls or is about to, there's always a hand reaching out for him, helping him back up. The palms of Hayate’s hands are rough from the harsh training but Kagemaru holds on tight.</p><p>Hayate’s touch is supportive, reassuring, a light brush against his shoulder or arm, when they are out on their first missions together, both of them secretly nervous and only attempting to get out unnoticed and alive.</p><p>His touch is gentle, soft, when he's studying a sword wound on Kagemaru’s left arm. It's nothing much, only a scratch in Kagemaru’s opinion, but Hayate tells him to be quiet and proceeds to properly clean and bandage it, his fingers swift and warm against Kagemaru's skin.</p><p>The touch is sharp and rough when Hayate’s irritation builds up enough for him to snap at Kagemaru, and to shove him when he starts giving back. They rarely fight, and when they do, the ill temper only lasts for a couple of hours.</p><p>Hayate’s touch is hesitating, almost shy, when he tentatively reaches out to brush his fingers against Kagemaru’s cheek. The gesture and the way Hayate's looking at him makes the hairs on Kagemaru’s skin stand up. He holds his breath and leans in while Hayate's still dithering, pressing their lips together in a sweet, lingering kiss.</p><p>Hayate’s touch is slow and caressing, and it leaves his skin burning; he arches his back under the touch, can’t get enough of it. It is, after all, the most important thing for Kagemaru, and after they're done, he huddles back against Hayate’s warmth, entwining their fingers and willing to never let go.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Missing in Edo</h2>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This one takes place some years after the events of the Ninjani movie. Edo period has started, wars are over, no need for ninjas anymore so Hayate and Kagemaru have changed professions and drifted apart.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again. And again.</p><p>It happened infrequently, but it always did.</p><p>Kagemaru would be walking along the busy streets of Edo, running errands, going to the market or bath house or grabbing a bite and a drink at a food cart nearby, when he’d see a familiar face among the people around him. The face he knew and remembered so well but hadn’t seen in years.</p><p>It was usually only a glimpse, so quick that when Kagemaru blinked and looked closer, the man had already disappeared, or his face had changed into that of a stranger. Kagemaru couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed every time that happened, the small spark of excitement flaming up in his chest dying down as quickly. The more it happened, the more it frustrated him.</p><p>He wasn’t even sure that Hayate was in Edo, it had been years since they’d parted ways anyway. People traveled more nowadays, he could as well be living somewhere else. The thought made Kagemaru both sad and happy. Countless times over the years, he had tried imagining what his old companion was doing, and his visions changed all the time. But in the end, imagining Hayate as a commoner like a merchant or carpenter or maybe in service of some local lord always cheered Kagemaru up somehow. He just wished the other was doing well.</p><p> </p><p>One day, Kagemaru was down in Nihonbashi as he needed to buy some fish from the market. It was busy as ever, the fisherman and merchants displaying their catch on the riverbanks and shouting their prices and offers while the common folk flooded around them, trying to find the best deals. Kagemaru hated the crowd, and the smell of fish, and wished he’d be somewhere else.</p><p>Kagemaru was just standing by the bridge, willing himself to dive into the crowd and make his purchase, when it happened again. His eyes caught a familiar figure walking against the flood of people. Kagemaru stared and blinked, many times, but this time the man didn’t disappear or change into someone else. It was Hayate, it had to be. He was wearing the kind of deep blue coat most fishermen usually wore.</p><p>Kagemaru watched as the man exited the fish market crowd and made it back into the city, and found himself hurrying after him, apologizing as he fought his way through the people. He kept his eyes on the receding back that soon disappeared to one of the side alleys. Kagemaru quickly ran up the road and turned around the same corner as Hayate. The side alley was less busy than the main street and he was able to spot the familiar deep blue jacket farther away.</p><p>Kagemaru saw Hayate entering a house and he hurried his steps. He didn’t know what he would say to the other, he just knew he needed to catch Hayate after so many close calls. His stomach twisting a bit with nervousness, Kagemaru reached the house that turned out to be a soba restaurant, and without hesitation he stepped in.</p><p>He immediately spotted the man with the blue jacket sitting on a table with his back to the door. Kagemaru walked up to him and tapped on his shoulder lightly, his heart thumping loudly in his ears. The man turned around – and Kagemaru’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“Yes?” the stranger asked him, a puzzled expression on his face. He was years older than Hayate would be.</p><p>“Ah, forgive me, it’s nothing,” Kagemaru apologized and bowed his head. “I mistook you for someone else.”</p><p>Kagemaru stepped back to the street and looked around, but didn’t see any blue jackets around. Frustration burned bitterly in his throat again. But this time, he was sure. He was sure he had seen Hayate. And now, he also had a clue of where to look for him again.</p><p>He wouldn’t give up until he found him.</p>
