      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga, a budding detective, is tasked with investigating a murder at a university. Going undercover means getting close to the prime suspect, but as Taiga gets to know the suspect on a deeper level, he begins to develop unexpected feelings. As the lines between professional and personal blur, Taiga must decide how far he's willing to go to solve the case. Will Taiga risk everything to pursue his feelings, or will he stay focused on the investigation, even if it means losing the suspect's trust?</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Taiga leans back in his chair, staring at the empty inbox on his computer screen. It had been a slow month at Detail One Detective Agency, and he can’t help but feel the weight of failure bearing down on him. As the co-owner and co-founder of the agency, Taiga knows that success is critical not just for his own sake but for that of everyone else’s.</p><p>He rubs his temples, trying to shake off the persistent headache that had plagued him for weeks. He can’t afford to lose focus, not now. But how can he convince potential clients that he’s a competent detective when there isn’t a single case to showcase?</p><p>Taiga’s thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the door. He straightens up and clears his throat before calling out, “Come in!”</p><p>The door opens, and in walks in Yugo, Taiga’s friend, co-detective, and co-founder of Detail One. “Hey,” he greets, plopping down on the chair opposite Taiga’s desk. “How’s it going?”</p><p>Taiga sighs. “Slow, as usual. I’m starting to worry we’re never going to get any clients.”</p><p>Yugo leans forward, his face serious. “Don’t worry about it, Taiga. We’ll get there. We just have to keep pushing.”</p><p>Just then, there’s another knock on the door. This time, it’s Juri, Detail One’s IT professional and Yugo’s college friend. He’s always tinkering with some gadget or another, and Taiga had never fully understood what he does. But Juri is essential to the agency, and Taiga is grateful to have him on board.</p><p>“Sup,” Juri says, taking a seat on the couch. “What’s the plan for today?”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head. “I don’t know. I was hoping to hear back from that client we talked to last week, but I haven’t heard anything yet.”</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow. “What client?”</p><p>“The one who needed us to find her missing cat,” Taiga says, rolling his eyes. “It’s not exactly the kind of case that’s going to make us famous, but it’s something.”</p><p>Juri snorts. “Well, I’m not exactly sure how we can use technology to find a cat, but I’m sure we’ll figure something out.”</p><p>They all chuckle at the absurdity of the situation, but Taiga can’t shake the feeling of disappointment. He knows that Detail One is capable of so much more, but without any clients, they’re stuck in neutral.</p><p>As they sit there, brainstorming ways to drum up business, Taiga’s phone rings. He picks it up and sees that it’s his father calling. He hesitates for a moment, knowing that his father disapproves of his career choice.</p><p>Taiga’s father is a prominent criminal lawyer, and he had always been overprotective of his family. He took his overprotectiveness up a notch when Taiga’s mother passed away when Taiga was only five. Since then, Taiga never experienced a normal childhood — he was homeschooled up to high school and took only online courses in college. His only friends are Yugo, his cousin Shintaro, and Juri by default.</p><p>His only refuge from the loneliness is reading mystery books, drowning in crime investigations online, and actually solving real cases thanks to Shintaro’s dad, who’s the head of the police department.</p><p>Taiga’s not going to lie — he’s thankful for his father for protecting him and keeping him comfortable. But he’s twenty-two now, a legit adult, and he’d like to have his independence now.</p><p>“Hi, Dad,” Taiga answers the call, his voice stiff.</p><p>“Taiga.” His father’s voice is equally formal. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything important.”</p><p>Taiga glances at Yugo and Juri, who are having their own conversation. Their shoulders are pressed together, and their faces are close, so it’s probably something intimate. “No, it’s fine,” he says, making a mental note to tease Yugo about it later. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>“I just want to remind you that Shintaro will be in town. He’s been assigned as a liaison to the police department, and I thought it would be a good opportunity for the two of you to catch up.”</p><p>Taiga feels a pang of annoyance. He always feels that his father uses Shintaro as a way to keep tabs on him, and he resents it. But he knows that arguing is pointless.</p><p>“Of course. I’ll make sure to set aside some time for him.”</p><p>“Good. And Taiga? I know that you’re struggling with your agency. If ever you decide that you want to pursue a more stable career, there’s still time to —”</p><p>“Dad, I appreciate your concern, but I’ve made my decision. I’m gonna make Detail One a success.”</p><p>There’s a pause on the other end of the line. “Very well. But remember, success isn’t just about making money. It’s about making a difference in people’s lives.”</p><p>Taiga bristles at the implication that he isn’t already doing that. “I know that, Dad. And I believe we can do both.”</p><p>“Very well. I’ll see you next week.”</p><p>With that, the line goes dead. Taiga sighs and puts his phone down, feeling more frustrated than ever. He knows that his father means well, but he can’t shake the feeling that he was being judged for his choices.</p><p>Yugo and Juri exchange sympathetic looks, but before anyone could say anything, there is a knock on the door. Taiga gets up to answer it, hoping that it would be the missing cat client, or better yet, a new client altogether.</p><p>But when he opens the door, he’s surprised to see his cousin Shintaro standing there, looking as welcoming as ever.</p><p>“Shin?” Taiga exclaims. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Shintaro grins that boyish smile that Taiga always associated him with. “I’m in town for a case, and I thought I’d stop by and see how you’re doing,” he says, giving Taiga a one-armed hug before stepping into the office.</p><p>“Hey, Shin,” Yugo greets with a smile as he finally separates from Juri. “Want coffee? Tea?”</p><p>“I’m good.” Shintaro waves a dismissive hand. “I hope I didn’t interrupt any work?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Taiga grimaces. “We have everything under control.” He feels his face flush with embarrassment. He hates feeling like he’s failing in front of his cousin. Shintaro knows Taiga wouldn’t like it if he reported this to his father, and he hates making Shintaro lie for him.</p><p>Shintaro looks around the office and clear his throat. “Actually, I might have something for you. For the agency.”</p><p>Taiga feels a surge of excitement. “We’ll take it! When can we start?”</p><p>Shintaro gives him a small smile. “I’ll get you the details tomorrow. The full case file is in the department. Good luck, cousin.”</p><p>As Shintaro leaves the office, Taiga feels a sense of relief wash over him. Maybe this is the break they need. Maybe they can finally prove themselves as competent detectives and turn things around for Detail One.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga, Yugo, Juri, and Shintaro make their way into the police station, Taiga can’t help but feel a wave of nostalgia wash over him. The station is a tall, imposing building made of gray stone that had clearly seen better days. The autumn afternoon sunlight casts long shadows on the walls, and a chill breeze blows through the air, causing the leaves to rustle and crunch underfoot.</p><p>As they walk through the doors, Taiga is hit with the familiar scent of antiseptic and old paper. The walls are lined with corkboards, filled with photos of wanted criminals and missing persons. Behind the reception desk, a stern-looking officer sits, typing away at a computer. Taiga’s eyes wander over to the glass-enclosed office where the Chief of Police sat. The office is spacious and tidy, with a large oak desk taking up most of the space. The Chief’s bookshelves are filled with leather-bound books, and a small collection of awards and trophies adorn the walls.</p><p>As they approach the office, the Chief looks up and smiles at them. “Ah, Taiga, good to see you again,” he says warmly, standing up from his desk. “It’s been a while since you’ve visited me here.”</p><p>Taiga returns the smile, feeling a sense of familiarity wash over him. “Yes, Sir, it has,” he says, trying to keep his voice steady. “It’s good to see you, too.”</p><p>The Chief gestures for them to take a seat in front of his desk, and they obliged. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable, with worn leather cushions that had seen better days. As they settle in, the Chief leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers. “Now, let's get down to business, shall we?” he says, his tone serious. “I’ve got a case for you that I think you’ll find quite interesting. Our office is swamped with some high-priority cases, so we thought you could take them on.”</p><p>Taiga nods, trying to keep himself from being too enthusiastic. He doesn’t want to look desperate.</p><p>The Chief slides a stack of folders to Shintaro’s direction. Shintaro then distributes the folders to Taiga, Yugo, and Juri. Taiga opens the folder and is greeted by photos of the crime scene. Particularly, at the center of the case file is the photo of a young man, probably close to his age or younger, sprawled on the grass, blank eyes staring at him. Taiga remembers the first time he encountered a photo of a corpse and how it made him nauseous. He’s happy to report that it’s no longer the case now.</p><p>“The victim is Nijiro Murakami, 20 years old, a member of the Kofu University’s Archery Club. They were in the news a couple of weeks ago. He won the gold medal for the Prefectural Championship. Found dead a couple of days ago at the university’s outdoor archery range.”</p><p>“Who discovered the body?” Yugo asks.</p><p>“Their manager. She went to the archery at 6 a.m. for some regular housekeeping and found the body. Poor girl.” The Chief shakes his head. “Estimated time of death is at 11:50 PM.”</p><p>“Any potential suspects?” Taiga asks.</p><p>“Lots of them. The prime suspect is his rival in the club. Apparently not happy with Murakami’s victory in Prefecturals. Also the last person to see him alive. Autopsy’s still ongoing, so I should send it to your office by tomorrow.”</p><p>There is a knock on the door. “Chief,” one of the police officers greet. “Meeting.”</p><p>The Chief grunts and stands up. “Well, as much as I’d love to stay longer and chat, I’m afraid I have to go,” he declares. “Shintaro here can be your liaison with the department, so if there’s anything you need from us, just tell him. Now.”</p><p>The four of them browse through the case file first before finally deciding to leave. Shintaro recommends this ramen restaurant nearby, and they return to the office with plastics of take-out.</p><p>As everyone else focuses on preparing their food, Taiga drags out the whiteboard and starts tacking photos and relevant pieces of information. It’s a cliché move, but if anything, it helps him get a bigger picture of everything that’s happening.</p><p>“The victim is Nijiro Murakami, 20 years old, and the star of the archery club of Kofu University,” Taiga mutters as he tacks the photo of the victim at the very center of the board. “Cause of death, blood loss due to stabbing. Murder weapon missing in the scene.”</p><p>He tacks a photo of the layout of the archery range. The range is set up in a large, open field and is surrounded by backstops to contain any stray arrows. There are six shooting stations, each marked with a synthetic target and a distance indicator. A good distance from the shooting stations is a shelter where the archers most likely find shade or wait for their turn.</p><p>“Taiga, you should eat,” Yugo calls from the lounge. It’s typically for clients to sit down, but it’s just the four of them, so Yugo had turned it into a makeshift group table.</p><p>“In a minute,” Taiga says as he flips to the photos of the suspects.</p><p>He freezes.</p><p>Taiga finds a photo of a man standing tall and proud as he looks far from what the photo is showing — he supposes this is a photo during the recent Prefecturals. The man’s hair is dark and wavy, his face strong with a prominent jawline. His dark eyes seem to hold a deep intensity. His expression is focused, no doubt in competition mode.</p><p>He looks at the name on the photo.</p><p>“Hokuto Matsumura. Prime suspect.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even during dinner, Taiga’s mind races with the possibilities. Obviously, there are still many questions surrounding the case. Like the location of the murder weapon. Everyone’s alibis. Even if the police already have a prime suspect, they can’t arrest them without concrete evidence.</p><p>And besides, the prime suspect is a college student. Circumstances aside, a wrongful accusation could mean a lifetime’s worth of humiliation and missed opportunities. Taiga wouldn’t want that for anyone.</p><p>His thoughts are interrupted when someone flicks him below his ear. “Ow!” he exclaims, a hand flying to the side of his face. He glares at Shintaro. “What was that for?”</p><p>Shintaro laughs. “Lighten up a bit, cuz. We still haven’t discussed the case, and you’re already thinking about it.”</p><p>“It doesn’t hurt to start working right away,” Taiga mumbles, slurping the last of his broth. An idea suddenly comes to mind. “I think I should go undercover.”</p><p>“What?” Yugo says. “Isn’t that … risky?”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “It’s normal to go undercover, isn’t it? I doubt any one of the suspects would trust a police officer right away.” He pats Shintaro on the knee. “No offense.”</p><p>“None taken …?”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s the perfect opportunity for me to get close with the club, narrow down potential suspects, and gather more clues,” Taiga continues, reaching for his glass of water. After taking a sip, he continues. “And besides, I could still pass off as a college student, right?”</p><p>Yugo narrows his eyes. “You were homeschooled all your life,” he points out. “Sure you can pull this off?”</p><p>“Chill, Yugo, I think it’s a great idea,” Juri laughs, patting Yugo on the shoulder. “You can do that while Yugo and I work behind the scenes. I could also help with setting you up with identification and shit for your student access.”</p><p>“Just let me know when you’re ready so I could clear it with the office,” Shintaro says. “You know, so you guys won’t get charged with fraud and all.”</p><p>Taiga smiles, feeling a glimmer of hope. This is it. Their first legit case for Detail One. This is going to be a challenging case, but he’s determined to solve it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga sits at his desk, eyes fixed on the screen of his laptop. He had been staring at it for hours, trying to come up with some theories in the case. He had always prided himself on his ability to solve even the most complex of cases, but beginning a case always leaves him stumped. It’s been barely a day since they accepted the case, and the pressure is beginning to get to him.</p><p>He sighs heavily and rubs his temples, trying to ease the headache that had been nagging at him for days now. He knows that he needs to talk to someone about how he’s feeling, but he doesn’t want to burden Yugo, Juri, and Shin with his problems. Yugo’s already juggling detective duties with admin work, and Juri is occupied with Shintaro with getting the necessary clearances for his undercover work.</p><p>“Hey,” Yugo greets, setting down a lunchbox on his desk. “You look like you could use a break. Wanna grab some lunch at the café?”</p><p>Taiga hesitates for a moment, but he nods. He knows he can’t avoid these feelings forever, and maybe some time off his laptop would do him good.</p><p>The small café across their office is small and inviting, with warm lighting and a pleasant aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. The walls are painted in a soft shade of cream, complemented by wooden accents throughout the space. The tables and chairs are mismatched, adding to the charm of the café.</p><p>They order their food and sit down at a small café at the corner. Yugo looks at Taiga, studying him for a moment, before finally speaking up.</p><p>“Taiga, I know that this case has been tough on you. We all do. But you need to know that you’re not alone in this.”</p><p>Taiga sighs heavily. “I know,” he says. “I just don’t want this to screw up. I don’t want to disappoint everyone.”</p><p>Yugo nods. “This is a group effort, remember? You don’t have to bear the weight all on your own.”</p><p>Taiga’s still learning to depend on others. When his uncle would consult him for cases, he usually solves them on his own. He has to remind himself that an agency is composed of more than one person and that he could ask help from others when he can’t handle something on his own.</p><p>“I <em>am </em>still worried about you going undercover,” Yugo admits with a chuckle. “This is your first undercover mission ever.”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Taiga assures him. “And besides, me acting as the weird new kid homeschooled all his life? No one will suspect I’m actually a detective.”</p><p>Yugo sighs and shakes his head in resignation. “Just keep your phone open in case your ass needs bailing.”</p><p>“As you wish, <em>Mom</em>.”</p><p>They have their lunch, and Taiga feels a renewed sense of purpose. He knows that he still has a long way to go, but he also knows that he has the support of his friends, and that makes all the difference.</p><p>As he looks at his laptop screen an hour later, Taiga feels a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he can solve this case after all. And if he does, he knows that he’ll owe it all to the people who had stood by him through it all.</p>

  <p>At nine in the morning, Taiga finishes going through his bag, double-checking everything inside to make sure he hasn't left anything behind. He slings his backpack over his shoulder and looks around the office for another round of double-checking. His first class, Art Theory, is in an hour, but Taiga wants to be on campus earlier to avoid being late.</p><p>“Good morning!” Yugo singsongs, placing a lunchbox in front of him. “Ready for your first day at school?”</p><p>Taiga laughs. “You sound like an excited parent.”</p><p>“Just wanna make sure you’re okay,” Yugo chuckles, sliding the lunchbox into a small bag. “How are you feeling, though?”</p><p>“A little excited, a little nervous.” Taiga shrugs. “Typical for any first day of school, I guess.”</p><p>The door of the office opens, and Juri enters, sighing in relief. “Good, I'm not late,” he says. He opens his backpack and hands Taiga a clear envelope. “I just coordinated with Shin and the school administration. That should be everything you need.”</p><p>Taiga opens the envelope and finds a student ID, a registration form, and a class list. He also finds a campus map, as well as the student list of the members of the archery club.</p><p>“Hokuto Matsumura’s in the same major as you,” Juri adds. “That should make it easier for you to observe him and see if he does anything suspicious. Let me know if you need anything else.”</p><p>“Thanks, Juri.” Taiga smiles and stuffs the envelope in his backpack. “Well.” He takes a deep breath. “I’ll be off, I guess.”</p><p>“Got all your stuff ready?” Juri grins, ruffling Taiga’s hair.</p><p>Taiga laughs. “Geez, stop it, you two, you guys are really acting like my parents, huh?”</p><p>This earns a laugh from Juri and a blush from Yugo, and Taiga mentally pats himself on the back for getting the reaction he wants. He knows that his two friends have feelings for each other, even if they don’t realize it themselves. Taiga can’t help feeling like a third wheel sometimes, so he does the best he can to help the two confess their feelings to each other.</p><p>He catches Yugo and Juri’s eyes locking for a moment, and Taiga rolls his eyes. This is going to take a while.</p><p>In the meantime, he takes this as his cue to leave.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga steps onto Kofu University's campus, observing the busy crowds of students rushing to class. He tightly grips his backpack straps, studying the campus map for directions to the building where his Art Theory class will be held.</p><p>Four years ago, Taiga didn’t receive his father’s approval to attend an actual university, so he settled for taking courses online. The fact that he’s now with other students excites him, but he’s overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. The area is crowded and noisy, and Taiga's mind goes blank.</p><p>He turns a corner and collides with someone. Taiga yells as he falls, wincing in pain. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, too. You okay?”</p><p>Taiga looks up and finds himself staring into dark eyes. He tries to speak, but his words get stuck in his throat. The man who bumped into him isn't only attractive —</p><p>He’s also the person Taiga is supposed to observe closely.</p><p>“Hey, you okay?” the man repeats, dark eyes filled with concern.</p><p>Taiga blinks and smiles, returning to reality. “Yeah, sorry, just a little lost, that’s all.” He searches for anything that may have fallen out during their collision and picks up the campus map he had been holding.</p><p>Hokuto glances at the map. “New here?” he asks, extending his hand.</p><p>“Yup.” Taiga takes his hand, allowing Hokuto to pull him up. He smiles gratefully. “My first class is Art Theory, Kiku Hall, Room 304, 10:00 AM?”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes widen. “Oh, it just so happens I’m in the same class,” he says. “We can walk there together.”</p><p>Taiga mentally pumps his fist. “That would be great,” he says, sighing in relief. “I’m Taiga Kyomoto, by the way.”</p><p>The smile on Hokuto’s face sends butterflies fluttering in Taiga’s stomach, but he ignores them. “I’m Hokuto Matsumura.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga follows Hokuto through the hallways, he can’t help but notice the whispers that seem to follow them. The chatter is hushed, but Taiga can still pick out snippets of conversation. He hears the names “Murakami” and “murderer” being murmured among the students.</p><p>He glances at Hokuto, searching for any sign of distress on his face, but he can only see a neutral expression. Taiga can’t tell if Hokuto is used to the gossip or if he’s doing his best to ignore it.</p><p>The two of them finally reach the door to the lecture hall. Taiga can see the curious looks of the students as they pass by. Hokuto remains unfazed, but Taiga can’t help but feel a sense of unease. He wonders how long Hokuto can last under the constant scrutiny of his classmates.</p><p>“Well,” Hokuto announces as they stop at the back row. “This is it.”</p><p>Taiga smiles. “Thank you,” he says.</p><p>“I should …” Hokuto slides his backpack and binder on the seat next to him. “Just pick a seat and do whatever you want. Professor Yamashita doesn’t really call students for recitation, so you should be fine.”</p><p>Taiga realizes that to accomplish his mission, he needs to keep a close eye on Hokuto. He feels a twinge of anxiety. He doesn’t want to draw attention to himself. And he doesn't want to risk losing his connection with Hokuto and becoming completely isolated among the unfamiliar faces on campus.</p><p>“Um …” He clears his throat. “Can I sit next to you? I really don’t know anyone in this school.”</p><p>Hokuto seems to hesitate, and he glances around the lecture hall before giving a small smile. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga finds himself sitting in class, listening to Professor Yamashita's lecture on postcolonialism and globalization in art. He realizes that he already knows the material like the back of his hand since he had taken this online course out of boredom the previous year.</p><p>He can feel the weight of curious eyes on them. Taiga feels the occasional elbow nudging and hears stifled giggles, all of which he assumes are at Hokuto. Taiga notices Hokuto’s hands clenching and unclenching on his desk, his jaw tight with what could be irritation or anxiety. Despite the constant scrutiny, Hokuto manages to keep his focus on the lecture, his eyes glued to the professor.</p><p>Just from observing Hokuto for a couple of hours, Taiga can already tell that he can’t be the killer. Hokut’s body language and behavior did not indicate any guilt or malintent.</p><p>He knows from experience that a killer would be proud of their actions and would try to show off their power and dominance. If Hokuto were the killer, he wouldn’t be able to hide his pride or desire to control. But Taiga can see the exact opposite in Hokuto. He’s unassuming.</p><p>Or maybe he’s just pretending?</p><p>The sound of the bell reverberates throughout the room, signaling the end of class. Taiga quickly shuts down his Notes app, his fingers hovering over his phone as he glances at Hokuto. “Thanks for walking me here today,” he says, his voice small in the sea of students bustling around them.</p><p>Hokuto’s smile is small once again. “What’s your next class?”</p><p>He looks at his class schedule. “Just this one,” he replies. “I’m the new assistant manager to the archery club, so I guess I have to meet the coach and the team.”</p><p>“Really?” Hokuto shifts close to look at his schedule. His eyes widen. “I’m in the archery club, too.”</p><p>“Well, that’s a coincidence.” Taiga beams. “I guess we should be going there together?”</p><p>Hokuto looks at his watch, his expression pained. Taiga understands — it must be difficult to go back to the club after what happened. “We’re not using the campus archery range right now,” he explains. “And practice isn’t supposed to start until 2 PM.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.” Taiga nods.</p><p>Hokuto seems to hesitate again, biting his bottom lip. “Would you like to get lunch?” he asks. “I’ll be with a friend. He’s in the archery club, too. But if you don’t want —”</p><p>Taiga quickly shakes his head. “I’d love to.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga and Hokuto walk to the campus grounds, he can still feel the weight of the curious gazes that follow them. Hokuto walks with a steady pace, his posture straight, and his expression neutral, seemingly unfazed by the attention. However, Taiga notices a subtle tension in his movements, and wonders if Hokuto is really as unaffected as he seems.</p><p>“The dining hall too crowded for you?” Taiga asks lightly.</p><p>Hokuto’s smile looks like a grimace. “You can say that,” he admits. “And it’s a nice day out.”</p><p>Taiga gazes at the trees, marveling at how the once-green leaves are now transforming into a vibrant spectrum of yellow and orange hues. “It’s okay,” he says. “I can always go to the dining hall another day.”</p><p>“Jesse’s already by one of the tables.” He stops, and his face brightens as he waves to someone from a distance.</p><p>Taiga follows Hokuto’s wave and sees a tall guy with blonde hair sitting at one of the outdoor tables. The guy immediately catches Taiga’s attention because he matches the description of one of the suspects on the list. He’s hard to miss with his imposing height, blonde hair, and a goofy expression on his face.</p><p>That, and his T-shirt makes him look like a walking Stabilo highlighter.</p><p>“Hokuto!” Jesse Lewis yells, waving his arms around.</p><p>This is the first time Taiga hears Hokuto laugh. It sounds so calming. Hokuto waves back and beckons for Taiga to approach Jesse.</p><p>Jesse blinks at Taiga. “Well, who are you?” he asks. “Hokuto never told me about a boyfriend.”</p><p>“Cut it, Jesse,” Hokuto sighs, a blush forming on his face. “Kyomoto, this is Jesse Lewis. He’s my best friend and he’s part of the archery club. Jesse, this is Taiga Kyomoto. He’s new here, and he’s apparently the new assistant manager of the archery club.”</p><p>“Assistant manager?” Jesse’s brows furrow. “I didn’t know we need one.”</p><p>Taiga sighs as he slides on the table across Jesse’s seat. “My dad kind of knows the university president,” he admits. “He thinks I need a club to fill up my resume.” He props his chin on his hand. “I don’t even know a thing about archery.”</p><p>At least Jesse looks sympathetic. “I hate those kinds of parents,” he remarks. “Where’d you come from?”</p><p>“Homeschooled most of my life.” Taiga avoids their gaze as he opens his lunchbox. He smiles at the sight of the many cherry tomatoes on his salad. “I was fine with it, but I said I wanted an actual college life.”</p><p>“Must be hard,” Jesse remarks, taking out his own lunchbox as well. “But as long as you’re with us, you’ll be fine.” He grins. “We could show you around. Heck, we’ll introduce you to our club mates! They’re cool.”</p><p>Taiga takes some time savoring his lunch before he moves to his subtle interrogation. “Matsumura told me the campus archery range isn’t available,” he says.</p><p>That changes Jesse’s expression. He glances not-so subtly at Hokuto before answering quickly, “Yeah, uh, maintenance. Not sure when that would be over, but we have to go to a nearby indoor range. But I’m sure you still have to talk to Coach Ikuta and Mone, yeah?”</p><p>“Mone’s our manager,” Hokuto adds helpfully.</p><p>Jesse’s voice is animated as he talks about the members of the archery club, describing their personalities, skills, and quirks. Taiga can see the passion in Jesse’s eyes as he talks, and he can tell that Jesse truly cares about the club and its members. Although Taiga knows that the information is second-hand, he appreciates the effort that Jesse is making to help him with the investigation.</p><p>He notices that Jesse never mentions Nijiro Murakami. It’s not surprising that they don’t bring up the name of the person at the center of the murder investigation, especially when talking to someone new. Taiga wonders if Jesse and Hokuto are intentionally avoiding the topic or if it’s just an unspoken agreement among the members of the archery club.</p><p>No matter. Taiga will have the information he needs in a matter of time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga can’t help but notice the stark contrast in how Hokuto and Jesse handle the stares and whispers. While Jesse seems unfazed by the attention, walking with a confident stride and an easy smile, Hokuto seems to be physically shrinking next to Jesse, as if he wants to disappear into the background.</p><p>They arrive at a different building and head inside a room labeled “Athletics Department.” Jesse slides the door open and heads inside, and Taiga tails after Hokuto inside. The faculty members present look at them but return to their regular activities.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Jesse says as he approaches the receptionist. “Is Coach Ikuta around?”</p><p>The receptionist checks her desktop and nods. “He’s in the pantry.” She stands up. “I’ll call him for you. Please wait for a moment.”</p><p>They’ve barely settled on their couch when Coach Toma Ikuta arrives. “Hey, you two,” he greets with a smile. “What do you guys need?”</p><p>“Um,” Hokuto speaks up, playing with the hem of his shirt. “This is Taiga Kyomoto. He said he’ll be the new assistant manager starting today?”</p><p>Toma’s face lightens in recognition. “Right, the President did tell me Mone needs some help,” he says, snapping his fingers. He holds out his hand. “I’m Toma Ikuta, coach of the archery club. It’s nice to meet you, Kyomoto.”</p><p>“Taiga’s fine.” Taiga grins as he shakes Toma’s hand. “I’m not an archery expert, but I’ll do my best to help.”</p><p>“You actually came at the right time,” Toma answers with a smile. “Mone needs all the support she can get.” His gaze flits to Hokuto and Jesse. “How about you boys go ahead and get ready to go to the range? I’ll just talk to Taiga for a bit.”</p><p>Hokuto and Jesse share a look before nodding and taking their leave.</p><p>Toma waits until the two of them have left before addressing Taiga again. “Let’s go talk somewhere private.”</p><p>As Taiga waits for Toma, he takes a moment to observe his surroundings. The meeting room is sparsely decorated, with no pictures or decorations on the plain white walls. The only furniture in the room is a long wooden table surrounded by several revolving chairs, indicating that it's a room primarily used for meetings. The whiteboard at the front of the room is blank, with only a few smudges of dry-erase marker left behind from a previous use.</p><p>Beyond the closed door, Taiga can hear the muffled sounds of activity from the faculty members in the adjacent room. He can hear the shuffling of papers, the clacking of computer keys, and snippets of conversations.</p><p>Toma finally enters and sets down a Styrofoam cup in front of him. “So, new kid?”</p><p>Taiga nods. “Matsumura and Jesse have been a big help so far,” he says. “I haven’t even started unpacking at our new place, so my first day is kinda overwhelming.”</p><p>“Good, good.” Toma takes a seat across him and sips his own drink. “Archery practice starts at two, but I guess now’s a good time for us to talk. Especially with what happened these days.” He looks over his shoulder. “Have you checked the news?”</p><p>Taiga feigns ignorance and shakes his head.</p><p>Toma sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “Well, the club has been heavily scrutinized these past few days,” he begins. “You see, one of the members of the archery club was killed a few days ago.”</p><p>“What?” Taiga asks. Sometimes he has to applaud himself for being a good actor. “What happened?”</p><p>“Nijiro …” Toma swallows. “He’s one of our best athletes. He recently won the Prefecturals. Proudest moment of my life.” He looks down at his cup of tea and sniffs. “But poor Mone. She was just supposed to do her daily housekeeping in the range when she found him lying on his back with an arrow on his neck. I understand why the President thought she could use some support, though I already told her she could take a break if she wants.”</p><p>“So … has anyone been arrested?”</p><p>Toma shakes his head. “We’re still under investigation. No one in the club went on hiding, so it’s either no one in the club is the killer or someone else is the culprit. Hokuto or Jesse might have told you that the archery range is closed.” When Taiga nods, he continues. “The police wants to preserve the evidence in the crime scene. Even I can’t access my office there.”</p><p>“How’s the team holding up?” Taiga asks.</p><p>“Everyone’s on their guard, which is natural. They don’t know if the club is being attacked or if one of them is the killer.” Toma’s smile is grim. “I’m just as scared as they are, but what can I do? I’m the coach. And we have Nationals to prepare for.”</p><p>Despite himself, Taiga feels sorry for the archery club. No one, except probably the killer, wanted this to happen. Even if this case is solved, the entire club would have to bear with the fact that they lost a clubmate.</p><p>“I’ll do whatever I can for the team,” Taiga declares.</p><p>Toma’s shoulders relax. “Thank you,” he whispers. “I’m sure it’s not going to be easy for you either, but Mone and I will do what we can.” He stands up and looks at his watch. “Well, it’s almost time for us to go. Shall we?”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The indoor archery range is a spacious and well-lit area with high ceilings and a polished wooden floor. Large windows on one side allow natural light to filter in, while fluorescent lights on the ceiling provide a bright and even illumination. The walls are lined with targets made of foam, each one marked with concentric rings to measure accuracy.</p><p>Despite the bustling activity of archers taking turns to shoot their arrows, the atmosphere is surprisingly tranquil. There is a sense of focus and discipline in the air, as archers line up their shots, take a deep breath, and release the arrow with a swift motion. Taiga finds this peacefulness contrasting with the tension that everyone probably feels with the ongoing murder investigation.</p><p>“Well, this is it.” Toma gestures toward the sight before him. “Our temporary station. Let’s go look for Mone, alright?”</p><p>Taiga feels the curious stares of the archers as he and Toma walk past. He manages a small smile and a nod in greeting before he and Toma disappear in a room.</p><p>He deduces it’s the supply room with the small space with shelves and racks that hold bows, arrows, quivers, targets, and other gear. On the workbench sat a girl in a ponytail who is sorting arrows on the table.</p><p>“Mone?” Toma calls, knocking on the door.</p><p>Mone turns at them then blinks in recognition. “Oh, Coach! Hello.” She then looks at Taiga curiously. “You must be the assistant manager.”</p><p>“Taiga Kyomoto.” Taiga holds out his hand. “Nice to meet you …”</p><p>“Mone Kamishiraishi. But Mone’s fine.” Mone seems to relax as she shakes his hand.</p><p>“Okay, then, you can call me Taiga.”</p><p>“I’m gonna introduce him to the team in a bit, but you can show him around after,” Toma mentions. He jabs his thumb to the direction of the range.</p><p>Taiga follows Mone to the range, where Toma claps his hands to catch everyone’s attention. “Okay, everyone, I need your attention, please!”</p><p>The archers put down their bows and borrows and whisper to each other as they form a circle around Toma, Taiga, and Mone. From his vantage point, Taiga sees Hokuto and Jesse standing at the back.</p><p>“Well, I know this is weird given current circumstances, but the President insisted that we get an assistant manager so there’s less pressure on Mone,” Toma explains. He nudges Taiga forward. “Everyone, meet Taiga Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga can feel everyone’s eyes on him, but he tries to maintain composure. “Hi,” he begins, giving a small wave. “I’m Taiga Kyomoto. Fine Arts major. Just moved here today. Nice to meet you all.”</p><p>He’s met with a myriad of gazes — some steely and unyielding, others curious and inquisitive. Despite the variety in the expressions, Taiga’s not taken aback by the reception he receives. The tense atmosphere in the club is understandable, with every member seemingly on edge.</p><p>“Well.” Toma puts his hands together in an attempt to diffuse the tension. “Nationals is in two months, so we shouldn’t slack off. Mone will walk Taiga through what happens in the club, so don’t disturb them unless necessary, okay?”</p><p>Taiga follows Mone to the supply room while Toma stays back to watch the archers in practice. “Taiga,” she speaks up. “Do you have experience in archery.”</p><p>“Not really.” Taiga scratches the back of his head. “Is it bad?”</p><p>Mone hums and shakes her head. “I didn’t know a thing about archery before I came here,” she admits with a chuckle. She turns on the lights again. “One of my friends used to be the manager of the club, and she had to move away. She showed me the ropes, and the rest is history. You’ll learn about the sport, eventually.”</p><p>Taiga knows there is still a lot to observe about the archery club, but he needs to do this investigation right, and that means he has to blend in properly. He focuses on Mone’s orientation, giving him a tour of the supply room and what needs to be taken in and out for the day. Mone also gives him a manual containing all club policies and procedures. There’s also a folder containing the member files, and Taiga mentally thanks her because this will prove valuable information.</p><p>“What else,” Mone says contemplatively as she taps her cheek. “Well, practice will end in thirty minutes. I guess you have time to observe and shadow me in the meantime. Any questions?”</p><p>Taiga takes it as his chance. “Coach Toma told me about … the murder.”</p><p>Mone’s eyes widen, her face growing pale. “Yeah,” she says, her voice small. “How much did he tell you?”</p><p>“That the victim was your star athlete. And … you found the body.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’d think watching murder mysteries would prepare you, but nothing beats the real thing.” Mone sighs and sits down on the bench. “It was around six in the morning? I was just supposed to do my daily housekeeping, then I saw Nijiro lying face down on the ground. I scared the janitor who was passing by, but we haven’t been the same since.”</p><p>“You think it was anyone from the club who did it?”</p><p>Mone looks at him, her eyes wide. “I don’t know,” she replies, lips turning down. “Everyone’s suspecting Hokuto because he was the last person seen with Nijiro. But it could be anyone. Nijiro’s a talented archer, but he’s not exactly the nicest person around.”</p><p>Taiga notices her hands balling into fists.</p><p>“Well.” Mone smiles. “I appreciate the President’s concern for me after I found the body, so I would really love it if we could work together and diffuse the tension among the club. Everyone’s innocent until proven guilty, right?”</p><p>He nods. He has a bit of what he needs at the moment. If he delves further, he might be branded as nosy and could arouse suspicion among the club members.</p><p>Suddenly, he hears noise from outside — the clanking of arrows on the ground and yelling. Taiga and Mone look at each other before rushing outside.</p><p>They find Toma holding back one of the archers. The archer’s face is red, and his chest is heaving. On the other side, Jesse seems to be shielding Hokuto, who seems to have shrunken, his gaze on the ground.</p><p>“Calm down, Kento, now is not the time for this,” Toma says through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Come on, Coach, we can’t have the suspect of a murder be around us!” Kento thrashes around until he frees himself. He doesn’t charge toward Jesse and Hokuto, though, but he jabs a finger at them. “For all we know, he has plans against us, too!”</p><p>“Well, Kento, until the police or the school administration tells us to keep Hokuto away from the archery range, we can’t.” Toma grabs him by the arm. “Make any more trouble, and I’m taking <em>you</em> off Nationals.”</p><p>Kento glares at Toma, then at Jesse and Hokuto, before picking his bow and striding away.</p><p>Mone sighs. “This was what I was afraid of,” she says as she moves forward to pick up the arrows.</p><p>“Okay, everyone, let’s go back to practice!” Toma orders.</p><p>Taiga can’t help but look at Hokuto’s direction. Jesse has his arms on Hokuto’s shoulders, whispering something, probably words of reassurance. Hokuto’s gaze remains on the ground, swallowing occasionally.</p><p>For some reason, Taiga understands. He remembers how it felt like whenever Yugo or Shintaro would drag him to play or hang out with their classmates. Taiga understands the long stares and the whispers that came his way, and he remembers all he wanted then was to go home and think that maybe being homeschooled was a good idea, after all.</p><p>It’s nothing compared to being suspected as a murder, of course, but the sight makes Taiga want to hope that Hokuto isn’t the killer. He takes a deep breath. And he’ll make sure he’ll do what he can to solve this case.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“And how is your first day of school?”</p><p>A box of donuts is waiting on his desk, and Taiga quickly sits down and grabs one of them. “I’m tired,” he mentions before taking a bite.</p><p>Yugo laughs as he takes a donut. “That’s understandable,” he replies. “You’ve been homeschooled all your life. But you’ll get used to it. Minus the investigation stuff.”</p><p>“Can I get clearance to investigate the crime scene tomorrow?” Taiga asks. “I don’t have class, and I’m not supposed to be in the club until the afternoon.”</p><p>“Gotcha.” Yugo takes out his phone and types something before setting it on the table. “Juri’s in the police station. We should get additional information soon. How was interacting with the prime suspect?”</p><p>Taiga thinks of Hokuto, and he shrugs. “The entire campus is practically suspecting him, and it’s getting to him,” he replies, finishing his donut. “It’s either it’s sending him into a spiral of depression, or he’s a really good actor.”</p><p>“Too early to tell, though.” Yugo stands up and observes the whiteboard containing everything in the case file. “The clues are straightforward, but we need a motive and conclusive evidence.”</p><p>Taiga stands up and heads next to Yugo. He didn’t have a chance to ask anyone from the club about why everyone thinks Hokuto killed Nijiro. And there’s something about Mone mentioning that Hokuto was last seen with Nijiro before he died …</p><p>And then he remembers.</p><p>“The coach and the assistant manager said different things about the body,” Taiga declares.</p><p>Yugo blinks. “Huh?”</p><p>“Coach Toma Ikuta said he saw Nijiro Murakami lying on his back, but …” He points to the photo of the body. “Nijiro is lying face-down, which is much more consistent with Mone’s statement.”</p><p>“Maybe he saw wrong?” Yugo tries.</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “Could be,” he says. “Lapse of memory. Could be nothing, but could also be something.”</p><p>“Guess that means we should look into the coach, too. I’ll ask Juri if he could ask the school administrators for his employee file.”</p><p>“I have the files of the club members, too.”</p><p>The door opens, and Juri steps inside. “We have autopsy findings and surveillance camera footage,” he declares.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo makes Juri eat first before they go through their findings. Luckily for them, Shintaro drops by with lunchboxes for dinner. While they eat, Taiga tells them everything he has gathered from his first day at university so far.</p><p>After that, Juri takes out his laptop. “Okay, so autopsy first. The medical examiner said that the cause of death is blood loss through the stab wound on his neck. The wound is deep, so it’s either he was struck in close range or someone actually used an arrow to stab him.”</p><p>“It could mean that the killer could be someone from the archery club or someone else.” Yugo shakes his head. “That broadens our suspect pool.”</p><p>“No signs of a scuffle, and nothing funny in the toxicology report.” Juri closes the photos from the autopsy before opening the video. “And here is the surveillance footage we got outside the archery range on the night of the murder.”</p><p>Taiga watches the grainy footage and takes note of the time. It was 8:30 PM when Nijiro entered the archery range. Juri speeds up the footage, and Taiga notices that Hokuto entered ten minutes later.</p><p>It was 8:50 PM when Hokuto left the archery range. “Hold on, pause,” Taiga says.</p><p>When Juri does so, Taiga notices that Hokuto is holding something. It’s a thick binder. Taiga makes a mental note of that. “I wonder what that is,” he muses.</p><p>“That’s something you need to get out of him, cuz,” Shintaro remarks.</p><p>Juri continues playing the video. “Nijiro never came out, though,” he adds. “So, if Hokuto Matsumura <em>is</em> the killer, he left him to bleed.”</p><p>“Nijiro could have rushed and called for help, though,” Shintaro points out. “No signs of him being restrained, right?”</p><p>Juri shakes his head.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hums. “I don’t think that stab wound is <em>that</em> deep for him to bleed to death so soon. Especially if the time of death is 11:50 PM,” he says. “Something else must have happened from 8:30 PM until Nijiro’s death.”</p><p>“I can check the footage from before the two went inside the archery range,” Juri volunteers. “Maybe someone could have gone inside and never gone out.”</p><p>“It’s an outdoor range, so maybe someone came in elsewhere, too,” Yugo offers.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll ask for surveillance footage from other angles, too.”</p><p>“I’ll do background check on everyone in Taiga’s files,” Shintaro volunteers.</p><p>“And as for me …” Taiga trails off as he hears his phone beep. He opens the notification and realizes that he had been added to a group chat.</p><p>The archery club’s group chat, to be specific.</p><p>There’s another message from Mone.</p><p><em>“Hi, Taiga! So sorry to have added you at this hour only. But this is where we also post important announcements to the archers. If you have any questions, just ask!</em>”</p><p>Taiga smiles and sends a thumbs-up emoji. Curiosity then gets to the best of him as he scrolls up the archery club’s group chat, hoping to access the past messages, but to his disappointment, he can’t. And the group chat is quiet about the murder, too. Probably some of the club members are talking outside this group chat.</p><p>“Hey, Juri,” he mentions.</p><p>Juri pauses from whispering something to Yugo. “Sup?”</p><p>“Is it possible to access past messages from a group chat?” he asks.</p><p>“That would mean I have to ask permission from the telecommunications company,” Juri replies.</p><p>Shintaro raises his hand. “I can ask the Chief.”</p><p>“Great.” Taiga grins as he scrolls through the past messages again and sees Hokuto’s reply. He thinks for a second before deciding to add him in his contacts. He then types up a quick reply.</p><p>
  <em>“Hey! I hope you don’t mind me adding you. Got worried after what happened at practice earlier.”</em>
</p><p>Taiga notices that the message was read, but there’s no reply. He sighs and locks his phone. He can’t force Hokuto to open up to him right away, but this is a good start.</p><p>Hopefully.</p>
