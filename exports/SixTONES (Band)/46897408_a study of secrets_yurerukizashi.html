      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga, a budding detective, is tasked with investigating a murder at a university. Going undercover means getting close to the prime suspect, but as Taiga gets to know the suspect on a deeper level, he begins to develop unexpected feelings. As the lines between professional and personal blur, Taiga must decide how far he's willing to go to solve the case. Will Taiga risk everything to pursue his feelings, or will he stay focused on the investigation, even if it means losing the suspect's trust?</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is a long time coming, and I hope my lifetime of consuming Nancy Drew, Detective Conan, and other mystery content has prepared me for this.</p><p>This fic is inspired by the Nancy Drew computer game <i>Secrets Can Kill</i>.
</p><p>This may contain plot holes haha please ignore them. My focus is mostly on the relationship development and less on the mystery-solving portion, but hopefully I can balance both.

    <h2 class="toc-heading">a study of secrets</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Taiga leans back in his chair, staring at the empty inbox on his computer screen. It had been a slow month at Detail One Detective Agency, and he can’t help but feel the weight of failure bearing down on him. As the co-owner and co-founder of the agency, Taiga knows that success is critical not just for his own sake but for that of everyone else’s.</p><p>He rubs his temples, trying to shake off the persistent headache that had plagued him for weeks. He can’t afford to lose focus, not now. But how can he convince potential clients that he’s a competent detective when there isn’t a single case to showcase?</p><p>Taiga’s thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the door. He straightens up and clears his throat before calling out, “Come in!”</p><p>The door opens, and in walks in Yugo, Taiga’s friend, co-detective, and co-founder of Detail One. “Hey,” he greets, plopping down on the chair opposite Taiga’s desk. “How’s it going?”</p><p>Taiga sighs. “Slow, as usual. I’m starting to worry we’re never going to get any clients.”</p><p>Yugo leans forward, his face serious. “Don’t worry about it, Taiga. We’ll get there. We just have to keep pushing.”</p><p>Just then, there’s another knock on the door. This time, it’s Juri, Detail One’s IT professional and Yugo’s college friend. He’s always tinkering with some gadget or another, and Taiga had never fully understood what he does. But Juri is essential to the agency, and Taiga is grateful to have him on board.</p><p>“Sup,” Juri says, taking a seat on the couch. “What’s the plan for today?”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head. “I don’t know. I was hoping to hear back from that client we talked to last week, but I haven’t heard anything yet.”</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow. “What client?”</p><p>“The one who needed us to find her missing cat,” Taiga says, rolling his eyes. “It’s not exactly the kind of case that’s going to make us famous, but it’s something.”</p><p>Juri snorts. “Well, I’m not exactly sure how we can use technology to find a cat, but I’m sure we’ll figure something out.”</p><p>They all chuckle at the absurdity of the situation, but Taiga can’t shake the feeling of disappointment. He knows that Detail One is capable of so much more, but without any clients, they’re stuck in neutral.</p><p>As they sit there, brainstorming ways to drum up business, Taiga’s phone rings. He picks it up and sees that it’s his father calling. He hesitates for a moment, knowing that his father disapproves of his career choice.</p><p>Taiga’s father is a prominent criminal lawyer, and he had always been overprotective of his family. He took his overprotectiveness up a notch when Taiga’s mother passed away when Taiga was only five. Since then, Taiga never experienced a normal childhood — he was homeschooled up to high school and took only online courses in college. His only friends are Yugo, his cousin Shintaro, and Juri by default.</p><p>His only refuge from the loneliness is reading mystery books, drowning in crime investigations online, and actually solving real cases thanks to Shintaro’s dad, who’s the head of the police department.</p><p>Taiga’s not going to lie — he’s thankful for his father for protecting him and keeping him comfortable. But he’s twenty-two now, a legit adult, and he’d like to have his independence now.</p><p>“Hi, Dad,” Taiga answers the call, his voice stiff.</p><p>“Taiga.” His father’s voice is equally formal. “I hope I’m not interrupting anything important.”</p><p>Taiga glances at Yugo and Juri, who are having their own conversation. Their shoulders are pressed together, and their faces are close, so it’s probably something intimate. “No, it’s fine,” he says, making a mental note to tease Yugo about it later. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>“I just want to remind you that Shintaro will be in town. He’s been assigned as a liaison to the police department, and I thought it would be a good opportunity for the two of you to catch up.”</p><p>Taiga feels a pang of annoyance. He always feels that his father uses Shintaro as a way to keep tabs on him, and he resents it. But he knows that arguing is pointless.</p><p>“Of course. I’ll make sure to set aside some time for him.”</p><p>“Good. And Taiga? I know that you’re struggling with your agency. If ever you decide that you want to pursue a more stable career, there’s still time to —”</p><p>“Dad, I appreciate your concern, but I’ve made my decision. I’m gonna make Detail One a success.”</p><p>There’s a pause on the other end of the line. “Very well. But remember, success isn’t just about making money. It’s about making a difference in people’s lives.”</p><p>Taiga bristles at the implication that he isn’t already doing that. “I know that, Dad. And I believe we can do both.”</p><p>“Very well. I’ll see you next week.”</p><p>With that, the line goes dead. Taiga sighs and puts his phone down, feeling more frustrated than ever. He knows that his father means well, but he can’t shake the feeling that he was being judged for his choices.</p><p>Yugo and Juri exchange sympathetic looks, but before anyone could say anything, there is a knock on the door. Taiga gets up to answer it, hoping that it would be the missing cat client, or better yet, a new client altogether.</p><p>But when he opens the door, he’s surprised to see his cousin Shintaro standing there, looking as welcoming as ever.</p><p>“Shin?” Taiga exclaims. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Shintaro grins that boyish smile that Taiga always associated him with. “I’m in town for a case, and I thought I’d stop by and see how you’re doing,” he says, giving Taiga a one-armed hug before stepping into the office.</p><p>“Hey, Shin,” Yugo greets with a smile as he finally separates from Juri. “Want coffee? Tea?”</p><p>“I’m good.” Shintaro waves a dismissive hand. “I hope I didn’t interrupt any work?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Taiga grimaces. “We have everything under control.” He feels his face flush with embarrassment. He hates feeling like he’s failing in front of his cousin. Shintaro knows Taiga wouldn’t like it if he reported this to his father, and he hates making Shintaro lie for him.</p><p>Shintaro looks around the office and clear his throat. “Actually, I might have something for you. For the agency.”</p><p>Taiga feels a surge of excitement. “We’ll take it! When can we start?”</p><p>Shintaro gives him a small smile. “I’ll get you the details tomorrow. The full case file is in the department. Good luck, cousin.”</p><p>As Shintaro leaves the office, Taiga feels a sense of relief wash over him. Maybe this is the break they need. Maybe they can finally prove themselves as competent detectives and turn things around for Detail One.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga, Yugo, Juri, and Shintaro make their way into the police station, Taiga can’t help but feel a wave of nostalgia wash over him. The station is a tall, imposing building made of gray stone that had clearly seen better days. The autumn afternoon sunlight casts long shadows on the walls, and a chill breeze blows through the air, causing the leaves to rustle and crunch underfoot.</p><p>As they walk through the doors, Taiga is hit with the familiar scent of antiseptic and old paper. The walls are lined with corkboards, filled with photos of wanted criminals and missing persons. Behind the reception desk, a stern-looking officer sits, typing away at a computer. Taiga’s eyes wander over to the glass-enclosed office where the Chief of Police sat. The office is spacious and tidy, with a large oak desk taking up most of the space. The Chief’s bookshelves are filled with leather-bound books, and a small collection of awards and trophies adorn the walls.</p><p>As they approach the office, the Chief looks up and smiles at them. “Ah, Taiga, good to see you again,” he says warmly, standing up from his desk. “It’s been a while since you’ve visited me here.”</p><p>Taiga returns the smile, feeling a sense of familiarity wash over him. “Yes, Sir, it has,” he says, trying to keep his voice steady. “It’s good to see you, too.”</p><p>The Chief gestures for them to take a seat in front of his desk, and they obliged. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable, with worn leather cushions that had seen better days. As they settle in, the Chief leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers. “Now, let's get down to business, shall we?” he says, his tone serious. “I’ve got a case for you that I think you’ll find quite interesting. Our office is swamped with some high-priority cases, so we thought you could take them on.”</p><p>Taiga nods, trying to keep himself from being too enthusiastic. He doesn’t want to look desperate.</p><p>The Chief slides a stack of folders to Shintaro’s direction. Shintaro then distributes the folders to Taiga, Yugo, and Juri. Taiga opens the folder and is greeted by photos of the crime scene. Particularly, at the center of the case file is the photo of a young man, probably close to his age or younger, sprawled on the grass, blank eyes staring at him. Taiga remembers the first time he encountered a photo of a corpse and how it made him nauseous. He’s happy to report that it’s no longer the case now.</p><p>“The victim is Nijiro Murakami, 20 years old, a member of the Kofu University’s Archery Club. They were in the news a couple of weeks ago. He won the gold medal for the Prefectural Championship. Found dead a couple of days ago at the university’s outdoor archery range.”</p><p>“Who discovered the body?” Yugo asks.</p><p>“Their manager. She went to the archery at 6 a.m. for some regular housekeeping and found the body. Poor girl.” The Chief shakes his head. “Estimated time of death is at 11:50 PM.”</p><p>“Any potential suspects?” Taiga asks.</p><p>“Lots of them. The prime suspect is his rival in the club. Apparently not happy with Murakami’s victory in Prefecturals. Also the last person to see him alive. Autopsy’s still ongoing, so I should send it to your office by tomorrow.”</p><p>There is a knock on the door. “Chief,” one of the police officers greet. “Meeting.”</p><p>The Chief grunts and stands up. “Well, as much as I’d love to stay longer and chat, I’m afraid I have to go,” he declares. “Shintaro here can be your liaison with the department, so if there’s anything you need from us, just tell him. Now.”</p><p>The four of them browse through the case file first before finally deciding to leave. Shintaro recommends this ramen restaurant nearby, and they return to the office with plastics of take-out.</p><p>As everyone else focuses on preparing their food, Taiga drags out the whiteboard and starts tacking photos and relevant pieces of information. It’s a cliché move, but if anything, it helps him get a bigger picture of everything that’s happening.</p><p>“The victim is Nijiro Murakami, 20 years old, and the star of the archery club of Kofu University,” Taiga mutters as he tacks the photo of the victim at the very center of the board. “Cause of death, blood loss due to stabbing. Murder weapon missing in the scene.”</p><p>He tacks a photo of the layout of the archery range. The range is set up in a large, open field and is surrounded by backstops to contain any stray arrows. There are six shooting stations, each marked with a synthetic target and a distance indicator. A good distance from the shooting stations is a shelter where the archers most likely find shade or wait for their turn.</p><p>“Taiga, you should eat,” Yugo calls from the lounge. It’s typically for clients to sit down, but it’s just the four of them, so Yugo had turned it into a makeshift group table.</p><p>“In a minute,” Taiga says as he flips to the photos of the suspects.</p><p>He freezes.</p><p>Taiga finds a photo of a man standing tall and proud as he looks far from what the photo is showing — he supposes this is a photo during the recent Prefecturals. The man’s hair is dark and wavy, his face strong with a prominent jawline. His dark eyes seem to hold a deep intensity. His expression is focused, no doubt in competition mode.</p><p>He looks at the name on the photo.</p><p>“Hokuto Matsumura. Prime suspect.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even during dinner, Taiga’s mind races with the possibilities. Obviously, there are still many questions surrounding the case. Like the location of the murder weapon. Everyone’s alibis. Even if the police already have a prime suspect, they can’t arrest them without concrete evidence.</p><p>And besides, the prime suspect is a college student. Circumstances aside, a wrongful accusation could mean a lifetime’s worth of humiliation and missed opportunities. Taiga wouldn’t want that for anyone.</p><p>His thoughts are interrupted when someone flicks him below his ear. “Ow!” he exclaims, a hand flying to the side of his face. He glares at Shintaro. “What was that for?”</p><p>Shintaro laughs. “Lighten up a bit, cuz. We still haven’t discussed the case, and you’re already thinking about it.”</p><p>“It doesn’t hurt to start working right away,” Taiga mumbles, slurping the last of his broth. An idea suddenly comes to mind. “I think I should go undercover.”</p><p>“What?” Yugo says. “Isn’t that … risky?”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “It’s normal to go undercover, isn’t it? I doubt any one of the suspects would trust a police officer right away.” He pats Shintaro on the knee. “No offense.”</p><p>“None taken …?”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s the perfect opportunity for me to get close with the club, narrow down potential suspects, and gather more clues,” Taiga continues, reaching for his glass of water. After taking a sip, he continues. “And besides, I could still pass off as a college student, right?”</p><p>Yugo narrows his eyes. “You were homeschooled all your life,” he points out. “Sure you can pull this off?”</p><p>“Chill, Yugo, I think it’s a great idea,” Juri laughs, patting Yugo on the shoulder. “You can do that while Yugo and I work behind the scenes. I could also help with setting you up with identification and shit for your student access.”</p><p>“Just let me know when you’re ready so I could clear it with the office,” Shintaro says. “You know, so you guys won’t get charged with fraud and all.”</p><p>Taiga smiles, feeling a glimmer of hope. This is it. Their first legit case for Detail One. This is going to be a challenging case, but he’s determined to solve it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga sits at his desk, eyes fixed on the screen of his laptop. He had been staring at it for hours, trying to come up with some theories in the case. He had always prided himself on his ability to solve even the most complex of cases, but beginning a case always leaves him stumped. It’s been barely a day since they accepted the case, and the pressure is beginning to get to him.</p><p>He sighs heavily and rubs his temples, trying to ease the headache that had been nagging at him for days now. He knows that he needs to talk to someone about how he’s feeling, but he doesn’t want to burden Yugo, Juri, and Shin with his problems. Yugo’s already juggling detective duties with admin work, and Juri is occupied with Shintaro with getting the necessary clearances for his undercover work.</p><p>“Hey,” Yugo greets, setting down a lunchbox on his desk. “You look like you could use a break. Wanna grab some lunch at the café?”</p><p>Taiga hesitates for a moment, but he nods. He knows he can’t avoid these feelings forever, and maybe some time off his laptop would do him good.</p><p>The small café across their office is small and inviting, with warm lighting and a pleasant aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air. The walls are painted in a soft shade of cream, complemented by wooden accents throughout the space. The tables and chairs are mismatched, adding to the charm of the café.</p><p>They order their food and sit down at a small café at the corner. Yugo looks at Taiga, studying him for a moment, before finally speaking up.</p><p>“Taiga, I know that this case has been tough on you. We all do. But you need to know that you’re not alone in this.”</p><p>Taiga sighs heavily. “I know,” he says. “I just don’t want this to screw up. I don’t want to disappoint everyone.”</p><p>Yugo nods. “This is a group effort, remember? You don’t have to bear the weight all on your own.”</p><p>Taiga’s still learning to depend on others. When his uncle would consult him for cases, he usually solves them on his own. He has to remind himself that an agency is composed of more than one person and that he could ask help from others when he can’t handle something on his own.</p><p>“I <em>am </em>still worried about you going undercover,” Yugo admits with a chuckle. “This is your first undercover mission ever.”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Taiga assures him. “And besides, me acting as the weird new kid homeschooled all his life? No one will suspect I’m actually a detective.”</p><p>Yugo sighs and shakes his head in resignation. “Just keep your phone open in case your ass needs bailing.”</p><p>“As you wish, <em>Mom</em>.”</p><p>They have their lunch, and Taiga feels a renewed sense of purpose. He knows that he still has a long way to go, but he also knows that he has the support of his friends, and that makes all the difference.</p><p>As he looks at his laptop screen an hour later, Taiga feels a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he can solve this case after all. And if he does, he knows that he’ll owe it all to the people who had stood by him through it all.</p>
