    <h2 class="toc-heading">Baby Fever</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Juri stared at Taiga in utter bewilderment, the question echoing in his ears like a siren's call. The room felt hotter, as if the very walls were closing in on him. He swallowed hard, his mind racing with confusion and a hint of excitement that he didn't dare acknowledge. "What... what do you mean, pretend?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. Taiga's eyes gleamed with mischief, his cheeks flushed with what Juri assumed was a mix of embarrassment and excitement. "Well," Taiga began, his voice a seductive purr, "I know we can't really have a baby together, but I thought maybe we could role-play. You know, I'd carry a pillow, and we'd go through the motions, the moods, the whole nine yards. It could be fun, right?" He took a tentative step closer to Juri, who could feel the heat radiating from his body. The air grew thick with anticipation, and Juri found himself torn between his ingrained skepticism and the undeniable allure of the unexplored territory Taiga was proposing.</p><p>Juri's eyes widened, his heart hammering in his chest as the reality of Taiga's proposal sank in. The thought of Taiga carrying a symbolic burgeoning life within him was both surreal and strangely arousing. His gaze drifted down to the swell of Taiga's hips and the soft curve of his stomach, now imagined to be rounded with a secret promise. "Okay," Juri murmured, his voice thick with desire, "but how do we... start?" Taiga closed the distance between them, his hands sliding up Juri's arms to rest on his shoulders. "First," he whispered, his breath warm and tantalizing against Juri's ear, "you need to fill me up. It's all part of the experience." With a gentle push, Taiga guided Juri towards the bed, his own excitement palpable in the air. Juri's body responded in kind, his arousal growing with every step, as he allowed himself to be led into the thrilling depths of this uncharted role-play.</p><p>Taiga's smirk grew into a full-blown grin as he began to peel away his layers of clothing, revealing the soft, pale flesh beneath. His movements were slow and deliberate, each article of clothing dropping to the floor like a sizzling ember. Juri's eyes were glued to the show, his breath hitching in his throat as Taiga's naked form was revealed in all its glory. Taiga then approached Juri with a grace that belied the urgency in his eyes. He dropped to his knees, the heat of his breath teasing the fabric of Juri's pants. With a devilish glint, Taiga leaned in, his mouth hovering over the zipper of Juri's fly. He used his teeth to gently tug at the metal tab, slowly revealing the treasure hidden within. The anticipation was almost unbearable as Juri felt Taiga's hot breath against his skin. The zipper finally gave way with a soft metallic whisper, and Taiga's mouth widened in a predatory smile. He nuzzled closer, pressing his cheek against Juri's now-bare stomach as he slid the fabric aside, allowing Juri's hardened length to spring free. Taiga looked up, his eyes full of lust and playful challenge, before he wrapped his lips around Juri's cock, pulling him into the warm, wet cavern of his mouth. Juri's hands found Taiga's hair, his fingers curling tightly as the older man began to bob his head rhythmically. The sensation was exquisite, and Juri could feel the beginnings of their role-play seep into his reality, blurring the lines between fantasy and desire. Taiga's enthusiasm was contagious, and as he sucked and licked, Juri could feel his reservations melt away like wax in a candle's flame. They were about to embark on an adventure of intimate proportions, and he was eager to see where it led them.</p><p>Taiga's eyes fluttered up to meet Juri's, a sultry gaze that left no room for doubt or hesitation. He pulled away from Juri's cock with a wet pop, a trail of saliva connecting them for a brief, tantalizing moment. "I want to ride you," Taiga purred, his voice dripping with desire. "I want to feel you deep inside me, filling me up until I can't take it anymore." He stood up, his body a testament to the passion coursing through him. "I want you to fuck me until I scream with pleasure, until you've claimed me completely," he continued, his voice a seductive whisper. Juri felt his own desires surge at Taiga's words, his cock throbbing with need. Taiga positioned above Juri, taking Juri’s cock in his hand, nudging the head of his erection against the welcoming heat of his body. "Fuck me," he breathed, "make me feel pregnant with your love." Juri's heart raced as he pushed into Taiga, the tight warmth enveloping him as if they were truly one. The role-play had begun in earnest, and Juri was all too eager to give Taiga the experience he craved, to delve into the depths of this fantasy together and explore the uncharted territories of their shared passion.</p><p>With a wild, animalistic cry, Taiga threw his head back, the cords in his neck straining as he braced himself on Juri's broad chest. His hips bucked and rolled in a frenzied dance, driving Juri's cock deep within him with each powerful thrust. "Oh, Juri!" he wailed, the sound echoing through the room, raw and desperate. "You're so big, so deep, so hot inside me!" His words were punctuated by his moans and gasps, his body undulating with the relentless rhythm he set. The slap of skin against skin filled the air as Taiga rode Juri with an unbridled enthusiasm that bordered on obsession. His inner walls clenched and released around Juri's cock, milking him for every drop of pleasure he had to give. The sound of their union grew louder and more primal with each passing moment, a symphony of passion that seemed to shake the very foundations of the room. Taiga's eyes rolled back in his head, his pupils dilated with lust as he threw himself into the fantasy, begging for Juri's release. "Cum inside me, Juri!" he screamed, his voice hoarse and needy. "I want to feel you fill me up, so deep, so hard!" His voice was a siren's song, pushing Juri closer and closer to the edge of his own control. The pleasure was overwhelming, a crescendo building with each plunge into Taiga's tight, welcoming heat. The room spun around them as their bodies collided in a maelstrom of ecstasy, the line between reality and role-play blurring into a single, blinding point of light that threatened to consume them both.</p><p>Taiga's screams grew louder, a crescendo of pleasure that seemed to shake the very walls of the room. "Fucking good!" he yelled, his voice raw and desperate. "Fuck me harder, Juri!" His hips bucked wildly, his body begging for more as he rode Juri's cock with reckless abandon. The bed rocked beneath them, the headboard banging against the wall in time with their fervent movements. Taiga's eyes rolled back, his pupils swallowed by a sea of ecstasy. "More, more!" he chanted, his voice a desperate plea. "Love your cock! Yes! So good!" Each word was a bullet of passion, piercing the air and driving Juri closer to the edge of his own release. He felt Taiga's inner walls contract around him, a sign that his lover was approaching his peak. The pleasure was almost too much to handle, a burning ember that threatened to engulf them both.</p><p>Juri's own passion took over, his animal instincts driving him to claim Taiga completely. He growled low in his throat, the sound guttural and possessive. "You're such a slut," he murmured, the words dripping with lust. "A beautiful, perfect slut." He thrust up into Taiga, his hips moving like a piston, each motion a declaration of his dominance. "I'm going to fill you up," he promised, his voice thick with desire, "to the brim with my cum. I'm going to impregnate you with my babies." Taiga's response was a feral moan, his body arching off the bed as if in offering. He was lost in the role, in the fantasy of their love, and Juri could feel the power of it, the sheer force of their connection. He knew that in this moment, Taiga was his in every way, and the thought only served to fuel the fire of his need. The world outside ceased to exist as they moved together, their bodies a tapestry of sweat and passion, woven by the threads of their shared desire. The only reality was the here and now, the two of them, and the all-consuming role-play that had them in its thrall.</p><p>Taiga dug his nails into Juri's shoulders, his eyes squeezed shut in rapture as Juri's cock hit that perfect spot over and over again. "Ah! Fuck yeah!" Taiga screamed, his voice hoarse with passion. "Right there, oh fuck, Juri, right there!" His nails left little half-moons on Juri's skin, but the pain only served to enhance the pleasure coursing through both of them. "So deep," Taiga panted, his body trembling. "You're so big inside me, it feels like you're going to split me in two!" His words were punctuated by the smack of their bodies coming together, the sound echoing through the room like a drumbeat of desire. Juri growled in response, his hips moving like a piston as he hammered into Taiga, his own release building to a fever pitch. "You're so tight, so perfect for my cock," he grunted, his teeth gritted. "You're going to take every last drop of my cum, aren't you?" Taiga could only nod, his eyes rolling back in his head as he felt himself approaching climax. "Yes, yes, yes," he chanted, his body taut with need. And then, with one final, earth-shattering thrust, Juri roared out his release, filling Taiga to the brim. Taiga's own orgasm followed, a white-hot explosion of pleasure that seemed to rip through his very soul. They collapsed together, their bodies slick with sweat and their hearts racing in unison, their shared screams of ecstasy still echoing in the air around them.</p><p>Taiga gave an exhausted but satisfied hum as he slumped against Juri’s chest to catch his breath. “Maybe of we do it again and again, it could be possible?” Juri couldn’t help but laugh in amusement at his boyfriend’s musing. “Just say you enjoyed this kink and want to do it again.” Juri teased, with Taiga giggling because his boyfriend caught up on it. There is gonna be a repeat of this, for sure.</p>
