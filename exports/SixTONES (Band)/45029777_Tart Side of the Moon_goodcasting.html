    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>If alcohol is a person, they would have long been in prison, or have gone to trial, as they had been blamed as the "culprit" for numerous human mishaps. And these two slightly drunk men were no excuse as they had a stare-off while their friends were passed-out from imbibing too much of what they could handle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You!" said Taiga, his finger pointed at Hokuto, "do you enjoy ignoring me?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't know what you're talking about," Hokuto replied, avoiding Taiga’s gaze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were clearly doing it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm not," Hokuto insisted. He attempted to get up, but Taiga pulled him back, and they both crashed on the floor with Taiga on top of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let me see if you can ignore this," Taiga whispered and before Hokuto could react, Taiga's lips crushed on his, his tongue coaxing his lips to part, but Hokuto still had enough sense and pushed him away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you out of your mind?!" He said through clenched teeth, wiping his lips as though poison was smeared on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga looked like he’d been doused with cold water, but instead of apologizing, he decided to reason out, “I-I drank too much, and you’re right, I must be out of my mind for kissing you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn't want to look insulted, but he was failing in hiding it. He knew he was a catch and being told that kissing him was a mistake was hard to take.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I must be out of my mind to want you even though I can’t even look into your eyes,” Taiga added which made Hokuto's almond eyes go wide. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d better go back to my room, oh, wait, this is my room." His eyes looked at the twin beds, both of which were occupied by Jesse and Kouchi, and the other was Shintaro. Juri was the only one wise enough to return to his room earlier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You should go back to your room," Taiga told Hokuto. "I'm too drunk to own up to any mistakes I might make." He got up and instantly felt woozy, but he held on and slowly went to the bathroom. He immediately washed his face with cold water, he was too reckless and stupid. How could he think of kissing Hokuto? Hokuto of all people! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He opened the door and saw Hokuto by the wall, his arms crossed, while his eyes stared languidly at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why are you still here?" He asked and for some absurd reason, he was afraid of crossing that line from the bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Proving that I'm not ignoring you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga shook his head. "Nah, you just ignored what I said that you should go back to your room."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shook his head and took a step closer to him. "You said something else before that…something about wanting me,” he whispered, which made Taiga go pink as he swallowed hard. He did remember saying that, but he now regretted it and he would pretend never to have said that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don't remember, now excuse me-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto barricaded his arm on the door. "No need to play coy, we're both drunk, let's blame it on the alcohol." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What are you saying?" Taiga asked, genuinely confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You want me…" he said as a statement, which Taiga didn't refute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I want you…" Hokuto continued, saying it in a voice that could literally induce someone to drop all their clothes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let's fuck."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto thought Taiga would jump on him when he said that, but Taiga waited until they got into his room. They kissed hurriedly as though there was a time limit, the alcohol in their bodies was their fuel, and they had to keep the fire burning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could feel himself getting hard just by listening to their moans; he could hear the hunger as their tongue mated. There was some degree of relief, too, because whether he admitted it or not, he’d been wanting this. This proximity. All those times he refused to get closer to Taiga, it was all because of this, he didn’t trust himself not to start having these feelings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their clothes were gone by the time they stumbled onto the bed, their breathing raspy while their eyes searched for a hint they wanted to back out, but as Taiga pulled him back for another fiery kiss, Hokuto was ready to give it all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you know why you should have sex with a Gemini?” He asked as he licked and bit Taiga’s ears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Taiga asked with a breathless sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re very skilled in using our lips.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga smiled softly, cupping his face and kissing him hard again. “I agree.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smirked. “I just don’t mean kissing…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga’s eyes widened and Hokuto knew he understood as he trailed kisses down his alabaster skin, tickling his nips, and spreading butterfly kisses on his belly button. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So yours is curved upward, huh?” He teased Taiga’s mushroom-like head with a few quick licks, watching his abdomen spasm, while he eyed him with anticipation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re hairy even here,” Hokuto murmured, gently sucking Taiga’s nuts, and gliding his tongue on the veins of his shaft, licking it repeatedly as though he was eating a popsicle, but instead of getting smaller, it kept on growing, and harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you like that?” He asked, Taiga looked down, his face red. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You really talked a lot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto chuckled. “Then, you’re really quiet even here? I guess I have to make you talk.” He wrapped his long fingers around Taiga’s hot rod, before slowly eating him whole. Hokuto moaned as he rubbed Taiga’s tip on the ridge of his mouth, and he knew Taiga liked it too, for he yelped in surprise while his fingers dug into the sheets. He decided to be more aggressive, bobbing his head, while his fingers also did the work. Edging Taiga but not allowing him to release, for there should only be one place where he should do that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t come yet,” Hokuto said, licking and sucking Taiga’s pre-cum. “Not yet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He returned to Taiga for a kiss, passing on that whitish fluid, until it was lost in the abyss. The room had gotten colder, but they were both sweating as though they were fighting a fever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll kneel for you,” Hokuto whispered, getting on all fours and he had to bite his lower lip as Taiga licked and sucked his peaches. He razed his teeth over his backside, and Hokuto had to stop himself from shouting for Taiga to bite harder. He felt his cheeks being spread, his fist clenched while he waited for the penetration, and he could only mutter, “fuck”, when Taiga’s hot breath blew on his arsehole. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait-” Hokuto said with a gasp, a tingle that spread down to his toes, his penis throbbing hard with each lick, but Taigas’ rimming made him feel shameful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Y-you don’t have to do this, i-it’s dirty,” he added, trying to pull away, but Taiga hugged his thighs tight and all he could do was cuss and moan as Taiga’s tongue tortured him. It was so good that it made him feel so bad. It might be taboo, but he couldn’t put a stop to it. It was heaven and hell until that bodygasm that also stoked him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How can you say it's dirty when I’ll be entering you?” Taiga said, spanking his butt, it stings, “take a deep breath.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm?” Hokuto arched his back as his entrance got breached, letting out a whimper as Taiga’s meat stick stretched his insides. Hokuto held a hand onto the bed frame and pushed back, he wanted all of Taiga’s dick to fill him. He wanted to feel fullness until it would be unbearable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re so tight,” Taiga sighed, trailing kisses over his spine and shoulder blades as his hips started rocking at a slow pace. They were hissing with each thrust, allowing their bodies to get used to what should be a familiar sensation. But it felt new, same ground but different heights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck me harder…now,” Hokuto begged as Taiga rammed his penis like a jackhammer. Their skin slapping sounded so erotic it was making him go harder. Every nerve of his seemed to tingle as Taiga pounded, and a new kind of thrill started spreading all over his body, while he got stretched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t stop,” Taiga whispered to his ear, “your butt is devouring my cock and I might go mad.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think we are already mad,” Hokuto said, moaning as Taiga shifted from kneeling to literally crouching over him, driving himself deeper. He whined with pleasure as Taiga increased his pace, the bed creaked, and Hokuto buried his face in the pillow to smother his cries. The end is near for their drunken sex affair; they may want it longer, but they were also craving to reach their crescendo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both came down hard, letting themselves be enveloped by a sweet spasm. Hokuto could still feel Taiga’s cock inside him, pulsating as he finished his release. Taiga hugged him from behind as they lay spooning, the rise and fall of their chest slowed, and Hokuto didn’t know how long they lay like that when Taiga asked him if he wanted another beer. </span>
