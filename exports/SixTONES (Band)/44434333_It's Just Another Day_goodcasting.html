  <em> <b>Prologue</b>   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Monday afternoon and Bondi Beach is almost empty. A couple of daring surfers were riding the huge waves despite the fairly cold weather, some tourist was having her picture taken while she fought with the wind as it kept on blowing her hair on her face, and on the footpath were two men watching the waves crash, an unopened beer can on their hand. </p><p> </p><p>“I hated my parents when we moved here,” said the man with curly blond hair. Although he looked a bit gaunt, one couldn’t deny his boy-next-door good looks. “They lied to me and told me we will be living by the beach, but we ended up in the Blue Mountains.” </p><p> </p><p>The man with straight black hair and distinctive Asian features chuckled. “Mine lied, too. My ol' man said he would just be here for some work, he had retired and we’re still here.” </p><p> </p><p>"Oldies love to tell us, kids, not to lie, but they all be lyin’ in our faces," the blond agreed.</p><p> </p><p>"Before we knew it, we became those oldies and we lie like a rug too." </p><p> </p><p>They looked at each other and laughed their heads off. There wasn’t even remotely funny with their exchange, but they laughed until there were tears in their eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me the truth, did you hate me when I decided on this?" The blond asked.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired man hesitated to answer, and when he did, he chose his words carefully. "I was upset. You're one of the strongest people that I know and you just…just chose to give up,” he said with a shrug. “But later on, I realized, you are probably the one who suffered the most in making that decision. It hurts and it sucks that all I can do is support you." </p><p> </p><p>Fresh tears fell from both of their eyes. Both of them quickly wipe those tears, but they just won't stop. </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, mate, sorry that you won't be able to join our honeymoon in Jeju."</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Baka, </em>I never intended to come along." </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Baka, </em>we already bought your ticket." </p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe this, it's been years and your pronunciation of it still sucks." </p><p> </p><p>They laughed again. A brief smile for every tear.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I used to call you <em> Hoe </em> because I couldn't pronounce your name properly without enunciating it slowly." </p><p> </p><p>The one called <em> Hoe </em>laughed his head off. "Remember when Mrs. Robinson scolded you for calling me Hoe? And back then, I have no idea what it fucking meant in English."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. But looking at you right now, you did turn to be one," the blond teased and their giggles were cut when an alarm rang.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired guy took out his phone to turn it off and looked apologetically at his friend. "I have a class in an hour."</p><p> </p><p>"Go," the blond said and turned toward the lifeguard shack. "Carl will be done with his shift and Ji-Woo is on her way.  </p><p> </p><p>The black-haired guy looked reluctant to leave but he just sighed. "Then, I'll see you later."</p><p> </p><p>The blond nodded and smiled. "See you later, Hoe!"</p><p> </p><p>"Later, <em> bruv </em>!" </p><p> </p><p>They gave each other a quick hug and said another round of goodbyes, and little did they know, it was going to be their last.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto listened to the pitter-patter of the rain while he gazed at the framed pictures on the wall; engagement photos of two of the most important people in his life, Brian and Ji-Woo. The photos were taken last winter, in happier times, when none of them knew that the wedding scheduled for next winter would be canceled. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry for making you go all the way here,” Ji-Woo said as she placed refreshments on the table, "as you can see, I’ve been busy packing.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded, glancing at the boxes around the apartment. “You could have asked me for help or-”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to do it on my own,” Ji-Woo said and handed him a croissant. “Or I guess I should say, packing our things is a very private moment for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto gave a curt nod. “I understand. So, you’re heading back to Melbourne?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup,” she said as she started wrapping plates with newspapers. “These are advance wedding presents actually, I should have never taken them out of the box,” she added, sighing. </p><p> </p><p>“What about your job?”</p><p> </p><p>“I resigned. I'm planning to go freelance for a while. How about you? How’s Uni?”</p><p> </p><p>“Busy with midterms.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Good luck to your students.  You plan to fail anyone?”</p><p> </p><p>“It depends,” he said, smiling mischievously.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah! Silly me, I forgot why I called you here, I’ll Airdrop something.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Hokuto asked and pulled out his phone. In mere seconds, he started receiving files. “What’s this?”</p><p> </p><p>“40 voice messages that Bry left for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto swallowed hard, the mere mention of Brian’s name could release waterworks he managed to lock up. </p><p> </p><p>“Voice messages?” He clarified with a smile. Trust his best friend, a sound engineer, to leave him voice messages. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I didn’t listen to any of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t mind even if you do. I’m sure you missed his voice.”</p><p> </p><p>Ji-Woo smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I do, terribly so,” she said with a sigh as her eyes traveled to the pictures on the wall. For a while, none of them speak, Hokuto forced himself to finish his croissant, and Ji-Woo resumed packing, while the weather outside became ferocious, adding bleakness to their already doleful mood.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Ji-Woo said after a while. “I think he left 40 messages, because of that belief that human souls can stay 40 days on earth before they go to heaven. This is the 9th day since his death, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you listen to his voice messages number 1 to 9.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll listen to it one of these days-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Ji-Woo snapped. “You will listen to it today, or tonight, but you will definitely have to do it before the day ends. You will never put off what you can do today. By tomorrow, you will listen to number 10 and so on until his 40th day.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm-”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I regret the most?” She cuts in, her face turning red. “I should have resigned from work the moment I learned about his cancer. I should have spent more time with him. I should have become that clingy fiancé. Because now that he’s gone, I realized that nothing else matters if he’s not with me…”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto walked to Ji-Woo’s side and hugged her as she cried. He started crying, too. The pain of regret rained on them in the shape of knives, giving them unimaginable pain that would probably haunt them forever. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Hoks…if you’re listening to this, that means I’ve gone to the other side. That means I’m now a ghost and I can see you flog yourself off. Go get yourself a girl, mate. When was the last time you got a gobby? HAHAHAHA. Seriously mate, smog must be low at the moment, I think I can see the Milky Way and your Big Dipper. Big Dipper is in the Milky Way, right? Or not? But whatever, look out from your window, and every time you see the Big Dipper, I’ve become part of that now….So cheesy I’m getting bloody goosebumps. I’m not good with this. You’re the one who’s always good with words, mine’s just half swearin, but once I’m gone, will we still be looking at the same sky? Can I still see the Big Dipper over there and I’ll tell all the other spirits that the Big Dipper is my best mate’s name? Hokuto. I never want to forget that."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Hokuto just finished one recording and he had to pause, he probably cried more now than back at the funeral. Listening to Brian’s voice, which sounded like he was trying not to break down as well was too painful. How could he survive 39 more voice clips? It was too overwhelming for him that he followed Brian’s advice and opened his apartment window. The rain just finished and he could only sigh at the distant lights from Darling Harbour; he'd gotten so used to city lights, treating them like his very own galaxy that he never bothered looking up at the sky. He did as what Brian instructed, but massive clouds obscured his view, it would probably rain again, and definitely not the time for him to search for his namesake’s star. He took a deep breath, braced himself, and played another file. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Hoks…I was serious when I said you would join us on our honeymoon. We always wanted to backpack up there isn’t it? But we got so busy, we never thought we could find jobs right after Uni! Jeju would be our first destination because Ji-Woo said it’s sort of a Korean tradition for honeymoon, then we’ll go to Busan to meet her nana,  then to Japan where you will tour us to your hometown, then to Beijing because of bloody Wang Yibo whom Ji-Woo goes cray about. Then, we’ll head over to bloody Kim Jong-Un. HAHAHAHA…I can’t believe I’m dying and the only country I’ve been to is Bali…which is a country, right? I can no longer travel, Hoks, but you still can, and I hope you try to see the world…before the world sees you off."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“In one of my favorite novels, The Timekeeper, it reminds us that time is the great equalizer. Everyone has 24 hrs. at their disposal. What will you do with your 24 hours?” Hokuto asked, sighing as his class’s attention is now on the clock above him, all of them waiting for the clock to strike at 2 pm. </p><p> </p><p>“Answer that question with a 300-words essay.” His class’s attention is now back on him, some simply groan, while others openly whinge that they still have to review for midterms and so. </p><p> </p><p>“That will be my parting assignment to all of you,” Hokuto added and silence fell in his class. He smiled softly and continued, “I already prepared your midterm exam, but a new professor will be giving it to you next week and he will be the one to grade it as well. Earlier, I talked about time being a great equalizer, but there’s an even greater equalizer, and that’s death. You and I will die. So maximize all the time you have, and don’t bet on your youth, because once the time is up, we can never get it back. Goodbye and good luck with your midterms.”</p><p> </p><p>The class started clapping as the bell rang, Hokuto waved them off and quickly stepped out of the room. Hokuto thought he would leave his job with a heavy heart, he loved teaching, and he really thought of it as his calling. But as he checked himself, he wasn’t that sad, or maybe because he had experienced a greater deal of sadness, and nothing had managed to top it off yet. </p><p> </p><p>His phone rang and he could only bite his lower lip seeing his older sister’s name. “Nee-sama” he answered.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you out of your mind? Did you really resign?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you tell mom and dad?” asked Hokuto immediately. Although their parents are financially independent, they are also the usual immigrant Asian parents who would beat his ass once they knew that he resigned from his work. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I’m not crazy, I told them you’re going to an exchange teaching something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! That’s a good alibi. I never thought of that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t flatter me, brother, what are you planning to do?” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed and paused from walking. The weather had gotten colder, leaves started to turn in shades of yellow and red, while others simply fell. </p><p> </p><p>“I just want to take a break,” he said with a sigh, his eyes in the sky.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you’re grieving, but don’t make permanent decisions because of this.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed again. “It may not look like it, but I’m doing this more for myself,” he said slowly. He was never the type to talk about his feelings to his family. He found it embarrassing, if not, he saw it as a weakness.  </p><p> </p><p>“I’m grieving, I acknowledge that, and I want to face this grief. I don’t want to keep on working and act like everything is okay, I want to give myself time; time for everything else I ignored before.” </p><p> </p><p>There was silence at the other line, Hokuto even thought he lost his sister. Until she spoke again, her voice close to breaking. “You will be back, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I am.” </p><p> </p><p>“Call or send me a message every day, or if you’re such a bludger, you can just send me your coordinates, GPS, or whatever to show that you’re still alive.” </p><p> </p><p>“I will,” Hokuto promised. “I’ll send you pictures every day.” </p><p> </p><p>“Take care of yourself out there.” </p><p> </p><p>“I will. Look out after mom and dad.” </p><p> </p><p>“You know I will. If you’re free, drop by lunch tomorrow, the kids want us to celebrate St. Paddy’s like everyone else, so I’m making corned beef and baked cabbage and you can have Guinness with your brother-in-law.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I’ll be there.”</p><p> </p><p>The phone call ended and Hokuto looked back at the sky. The next time he was looking at the same sky, he was on the plane to Jeju Island. </p><p>

  <span>Cobalt blue waters, volcanic rocks on white sand, and towering wind turbines from the distance are the picture Hokuto sent to his sister. Eleven hours of layover at Changi and he hasn’t had a wink, he had too much adrenaline earlier, but he could feel himself dozing off the moment he hits the sheets. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto Matsumura?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto turned and saw a tall and gorgeous man running toward him. He wore a jumper with a “Welcome to Jeju Island” printed on it and paired it with neon green jogger pants that made Hokuto reach for his sunglasses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesse Lewis, but you may call me Jesse,” he said, panting slightly as he offered his hand for a handshake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto Matsumura,” he replied as they shook hands.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto. Cool,” Jesse said and quickly picked up his luggage despite his protests. “Ah, this area is called Gimnyeong Beach, the driver dropped you quite far off from the village’s entrance, we have to walk for a bit so let me carry this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“B-but it's really heavy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse chuckled and flexed his biceps, which Hokuto couldn’t see underneath the jumper. Nonetheless, he could make out the thickness of his upper arms. “And that’s why I work out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto simply apologized and let Jesse carry his luggage. Soon, they left the beach and entered narrow streets lined with either black stone walls or concrete.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be seeing a lot of these rocks all over Jeju,” Jesse said. “Volcanic rocks are quite abundant here, basically, the entire place is raining with stones.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded, making a mental note to read the free guidebook he got from the airport. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There are 30 murals around here, you’ll be staying long enough so check them all out,” Jesse said as he pointed to one of the murals made of metals. Hokuto took a snap of it, and when he looked closely, he concluded that it must be the village seen from afar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aside from the beach, all these murals around the village were made to attract tourists,” Jesse added as they walked more, Jesse greeted almost everyone they met on the road by name, and Hokuto was tempted to ask if Jesse was a politician or something. They reached a spacious part of the village, and Hokuto noticed a circular enclosure made of those volcanic rocks with a mountain of dry hay inside it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s where they cook black pigs and share them with everyone. You should definitely experience it,” Jesse suggested and pointed to a large building to his right by the sea, “that’s the Harmony Hall, it’s like our very own tourism center, and you can go there to learn more about the village.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I see and I will.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walked a bit more, the sun rays were becoming harsh but the cold wind still made it tolerable. “The sea is quite calm, isn’t it?” Hokuto observed as they passed by a sea wall with wave breakers, and somehow, the tranquil made him miss the </span>
  <em>
    <span>plunging breakers</span>
  </em>
  <span> crashing on the shores of Bondi. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse nodded repeatedly. “It's calm during spring, you can expect some waves during summer or when there's a typhoon. But overall, pretty calm. And here we are!” Jesse said, making a grand gesture with his hand as they entered a gated compound. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Welcome to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Retreat and Create!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Jesse announced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gazed at his residence for the next three months, and he couldn’t help but be in awe. The 2-floor </span>
  <em>
    <span>hanok </span>
  </em>
  <span>was obviously new, but it radiated warmth with an old-style charm. A Japanese stone garden filled the courtyard, adding a feeling of Zen to the place, and a wooden porch swing hung on the corner patio. </span>

  <span>“Basically, this place was started as a retreat house for writers, but when it became sort of a fad to unplug from SNS, the owner decided to open it for everyone who wanted to disconnect, recharge, reflect, or basically anyone who wanted a safe and quiet space. The owner still runs a retreat exclusively for writers during winter though, because that’s the time when there are fewer tourists,” Jesse narrated as they went up to the second floor. “I received two boxes of your stuff three days ago, and I’ve put them in your room. If you’re planning to receive any more packages, please address them to the coffee house because most of the time, no one would receive them here. This is your room.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse opened the wooden doors widely to his spacious </span>
  <em>
    <span>ondol </span>
  </em>
  <span>room. His room looked exactly how it was advertised on the site, yellow heated flooring, windows adorned with intricately styled papercraft, a coffee table on the side, and a flat-screen TV hanging by the wall. “The futon and pillows are inside the closet, you have your own toilet and shower, and as for the Wi-Fi password, it’s J-e-s-$-3.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded. “Right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to take a rest, or do you want me to give you a quick tour of the place? House rules?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, I think I want to rest first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should!” Jesse said. “After all, you won’t get to meet the other tenants at this time. Most of them are late risers and the only person who wakes up early is working at the coffee house. Ah, you are our 5th tenant.” Jesse pulled out his phone and showed him a QR code. “Scan mine so we can contact each other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah!” Hokuto took out his phone and scanned Jesse’s QR code. “I think I need to install the app first.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you don’t have Kakao yet? You should install that, it also has Kakao Maps which has bus routes and bus times here in Jeju. And also add Papago, an excellent online translator.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I have to go somewhere. Rest well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto slid down on the floor as soon as he closed the door. The floor was warm enough that he could sleep without a futon, the room and the place were quiet, and he felt like he was the only person in the guesthouse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what do I do now?” He is tired and lost. He might have told his sister that he wanted to rest and travel. He talked big to his students about maximizing their time, but in reality, he had no idea what he wanted to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He decided to play one of Brian’s older Brian’s voice files and it wasn’t long before his best friend’s voice filled his room before he fell asleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hunger woke Hokuto, he glanced sleepily at his phone, and he immediately got up seeing it was 45 minutes past 9 in the evening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I slept for like half a day,” he murmured and blindly reached for the switch to turn on the light. He opened his window and quickly shut it as he could feel ice on the wind. He only experienced winter in Sydney and it should be spring now in Jeju, but what he felt from opening the window could probably give him frostbite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He ignored the hunger pangs and opened the box he shipped from home, thankful to Ji-Woo for giving him an insulated parka. He left his room not knowing where to go, the guest house looked mystical with warm lights around he just had to pause and take in everything he saw beyond the darkness of the night. The unmistakable smell of chili powder wafted toward him as he reached the courtyard, he saw a door slightly ajar, and when he took a peek, he assumed that this must be the common room. On his left side was a huge white L-shaped sofa facing an unlit fireplace, there was also a reading nook with a couple of bean bags and large cushions. In the middle and in front of him is a rustic-style picnic table, and on his right side is a glossy contemporary-styled kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His tummy grumbled and he didn’t think it was that loud, but the man by the stove turned to face him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are?” The man asked in an almost hypnotic way, or maybe it wasn’t his voice, but his face that left one mesmerized.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“-you must be the newest tenant?” He cuts in, a ladle by his hand that he kept on blowing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’re hungry, I made too much noodles, we could share.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was about to decline, but the man returned his attention to the pot of noodles and started cutting leeks into it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, is there anything I can help you with?” Hokuto asked as his stomach grumbled once more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can prepare the bowls,” he said with a glance back at him. “It’s on that shelf with a green sticker.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay.” Hokuto quickly moved and gathered what was needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Spoon and chopsticks on the first drawer below,” the man instructed and Hokuto found those too. He quickly set up the table as the man arrived with a steaming pot of noodles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is a new brand, I never tried it, but it’s quite popular because of the cheese powder,” he said as he filled Hokuto’s bowl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for this. T-this is quite loaded,” he said after noticing that aside from leeks, the instant noodles also have ham, sausage, egg, and cabbage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s normal around here,” the man said and started wolfing down his noodles after he said his grace. “Mmmm…it’s good!” He said, his eyes wide, and Hokuto thought they sparkled as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded and ate his share. He didn't know whether it was because he was just hungry, but the ramen was insanely good. One of the best he ever tasted. They merely nodded in agreement with one another, and the next few minutes were spent with nothing but the sound of slurps and sips, until the satisfying burps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I only bought one of these, now I need to buy a dozen,” the man said and Hokuto quickly nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s…superb!” Hokuto said as he rubbed his tummy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I’m sorry, but I need to get back to my room-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Leave the cleaning to me, it’s the least I could do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man smiled. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I should be the one thanking you,” Hokuto insisted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, by the way-” They both chuckled realizing they said the same thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You go first,” the man said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Err, I’m Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man extended his hand. “Nice to meet you, Hokuto. I’m Taiga.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto just finished washing the dishes when he heard two people arguing and the door to the common room opened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you — oh, Hokuto!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto gave a curt nod to Jesse. “Good evening.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man beside Jesse smiled. “You must be the newest tenant? Hi, I’m Yugo.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello. I’m Hokuto.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse raised the two plastic bags he was carrying. “Fancy midnight snacks? We have fish cakes, dried squid, and soju.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine. I-I’ve already eaten,” he said and the two looked embarrassed to be rejected that he quickly added, “but I don’t mind drinking a bit.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both smiled and said, “cool!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Glad you found the kitchen,” Jesse said after a while. In the end, Hokuto also ate some fish cakes because it was so good. He must be really hungry if he found everything this good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Someone was cooking ramen earlier and that’s how I found out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ramen? So you’ve just met Taiga,” Yugo said and refilled his shot glass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded and downed his glass. He had no idea how many shots he drank, but his body started warming up so he had to remove his parka. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Taiga is in room no. 4, it’s also on the second floor,” Jesse mumbled while he fought with the unpleasantly chewy dried squid, “first room after reaching upstairs. Kouchi here is in room no. 2, second room from the main entrance, mine’s room no.1 beside his.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was about to ask who Kouchi is, but Yugo must have read his mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My full name is Yugo Kouchi, and he’d rather call me Kouchi.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded and Jesse continued, “the room beside Taiga is Juri’s, he went to a festival in the other town so you’ll probably see him tomorrow. Then, you're in no. 6, and below Juri’s room is Shintaro’s.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you see someone reading a book on the swing, that’s Shintaro,” Yugo said. “He’s on a ‘no-speaking rule’, so better to ignore him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wanted to ask what was this “no speaking rule” but Jesse interjected, “Ah, the laundry and dryer room is beside Kouchi’s room. Laundry should only be done in the morning, if you want to hang your clothes to dry, leave them in the courtyard, and finally, as you can see, this is the common area. I have a strict ‘clean as you go’ policy, and if you’re going to bring in food, make sure to label it, and never steal others' food.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shook his head. “I won’t even think about it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cleaning your room is also your responsibility,” Jesse added. “You can bring in guests but they are not allowed to sleep over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t even have guests to bring.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse smiled widely, his face reddish, and Hokuto could tell that he is now drunk. “And those are the house rules.” He yawned and stretched. “I’m sleepy, good night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good night,” Hokuto said and he and Yugo watched Jesse go straight to the couch and lie down. “Is – is he sleeping there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Yugo nodded. “He’s the first person who breaks all the house rules, don’t worry about him. If you visit the coffee house tomorrow, your first coffee is free.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smiled, even though it was his first time meeting Yugo, he found him easy to talk to, and he had this radiating persona as though you could tell him anything.  “Thank you. Where is this coffee shop?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By the beach, near the first wind turbine, you will see from here. Thus, it’s called </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gentle Breeze Cafe.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll definitely go there tomorrow, uhm-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you want to go back to your room, go, I’ll clean up here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to help, but I still need to unpack.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No big deal, good night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good night, too. It’s nice meeting you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Likewise.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto headed upstairs, he could hear guitar strums coming from Taiga’s room, and as he returned to his room, he felt lighter compared to his mood when he arrived. Maybe food gave him a false sense of happiness, or maybe he was just hungry all along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s now 11:30 pm in Jeju according to the roaming clock of his phone, while Down Under, it’s now 1:30 past midnight. Hokuto didn’t think time zones were such a marvel as he played file no. 20; the 20th voice file, and 20 days since Brian’s death. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One voice message a day, I’m on the right track to 40 days,” he murmured, the clip playing in the background, while he thought of ways to make his room look like his own. He took out everything from the boxes and his suitcase until it occupied half of his room. He first arranged his books on the coffee table, all 10 books he brought last year that were all in pristine condition for he had never read them. He followed them with 3 folding picture frames, the 1st frame contained his family picture from when he graduated from Uni, his parents looked so unimpressed with him being a Summa Cum Laude, and the 2nd frame is a picture of his two nephews wearing </span>
  <em>
    <span>hakama </span>
  </em>
  <span>for Children's Day, and on the 3rd frame is a picture of him and Brian during their teenage years when they thought it was cool to be overly tanned, have one part of their eyebrow shave, and the worst of all, they had their tongues pierced. </span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Remember when we got our tongue pierced and it got infected so we have to take antibiotics? Why did we even think that was cool? HAHAHA. Once you have your own kids, even if they call you uncool, never ever allow them to get tongue piercings. Never, Hoks! </span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voice clip no. 20 has ended and Hokuto hasn't gotten far in arranging his stuff, he didn’t know why he even brought his high school yearbook with him, but it got him distracted while he cringed and laughed at their yearbook captions. They were all given 150 characters like in Twitter and of all the things he could think of, he really wrote, “you’re all gonna regret not dating me in high school”, even though they went to an all-boys school, and when Brian saw his caption, he just had to change his to “Hokuto, I’m sorry for rejecting your feelings.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could only heave a sigh once his laughter died down, he wasted almost 2 hours checking out his yearbook. It was fun to reminisce about their past, until the present cut through like a knife, making him remember that Brian is no longer part of his present and even his future.</span>
