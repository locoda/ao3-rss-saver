  <em> <b>Prologue</b>   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Monday afternoon and Bondi Beach is almost empty. A couple of daring surfers were riding the huge waves despite the fairly cold weather, some tourist was having her picture taken while she fought with the wind as it kept on blowing her hair on her face, and on the footpath were two men watching the waves crash, an unopened beer can on their hand. </p><p> </p><p>“I hated my parents when we moved here,” said the man with curly blond hair. Although he looked a bit gaunt, one couldn’t deny his boy-next-door good looks. “They lied to me and told me we will be living by the beach, but we ended up in the Blue Mountains.” </p><p> </p><p>The man with straight black hair and distinctive Asian features chuckled. “Mine lied, too. My ol' man said he would just be here for some work, he had retired and we’re still here.” </p><p> </p><p>"Oldies love to tell us, kids, not to lie, but they all be lyin’ in our faces," the blond agreed.</p><p> </p><p>"Before we knew it, we became those oldies and we lie like a rug too." </p><p> </p><p>They looked at each other and laughed their heads off. There wasn’t even remotely funny with their exchange, but they laughed until there were tears in their eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"Tell me the truth, did you hate me when I decided on this?" The blond asked.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired man hesitated to answer, and when he did, he chose his words carefully. "I was upset. You're one of the strongest people that I know and you just…just chose to give up,” he said with a shrug. “But later on, I realized, you are probably the one who suffered the most in making that decision. It hurts and it sucks that all I can do is support you." </p><p> </p><p>Fresh tears fell from both of their eyes. Both of them quickly wipe those tears, but they just won't stop. </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, mate, sorry that you won't be able to join our honeymoon in Jeju."</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Baka, </em>I never intended to come along." </p><p> </p><p>"<em>Baka, </em>we already bought your ticket." </p><p> </p><p>"I can't believe this, it's been years and your pronunciation of it still sucks." </p><p> </p><p>They laughed again. A brief smile for every tear.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I used to call you <em> Hoe </em> because I couldn't pronounce your name properly without enunciating it slowly." </p><p> </p><p>The one called <em> Hoe </em>laughed his head off. "Remember when Mrs. Robinson scolded you for calling me Hoe? And back then, I have no idea what it fucking meant in English."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. But looking at you right now, you did turn to be one," the blond teased and their giggles were cut when an alarm rang.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired guy took out his phone to turn it off and looked apologetically at his friend. "I have a class in an hour."</p><p> </p><p>"Go," the blond said and turned toward the lifeguard shack. "Carl will be done with his shift and Ji-Woo is on her way.  </p><p> </p><p>The black-haired guy looked reluctant to leave but he just sighed. "Then, I'll see you later."</p><p> </p><p>The blond nodded and smiled. "See you later, Hoe!"</p><p> </p><p>"Later, <em> bruv </em>!" </p><p> </p><p>They gave each other a quick hug and said another round of goodbyes, and little did they know, it was going to be their last.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto listened to the pitter-patter of the rain while he gazed at the framed pictures on the wall; engagement photos of two of the most important people in his life, Brian and Ji-Woo. The photos were taken last winter, in happier times, when none of them knew that the wedding scheduled for next winter would be canceled. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry for making you go all the way here,” Ji-Woo said as she placed refreshments on the table, "as you can see, I’ve been busy packing.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded, glancing at the boxes around the apartment. “You could have asked me for help or-”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to do it on my own,” Ji-Woo said and handed him a croissant. “Or I guess I should say, packing our things is a very private moment for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto gave a curt nod. “I understand. So, you’re heading back to Melbourne?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup,” she said as she started wrapping plates with newspapers. “These are advance wedding presents actually, I should have never taken them out of the box,” she added, sighing. </p><p> </p><p>“What about your job?”</p><p> </p><p>“I resigned. I'm planning to go freelance for a while. How about you? How’s Uni?”</p><p> </p><p>“Busy with midterms.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Good luck to your students.  You plan to fail anyone?”</p><p> </p><p>“It depends,” he said, smiling mischievously.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah! Silly me, I forgot why I called you here, I’ll Airdrop something.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Hokuto asked and pulled out his phone. In mere seconds, he started receiving files. “What’s this?”</p><p> </p><p>“40 voice messages that Bry left for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto swallowed hard, the mere mention of Brian’s name could release waterworks he managed to lock up. </p><p> </p><p>“Voice messages?” He clarified with a smile. Trust his best friend, a sound engineer, to leave him voice messages. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I didn’t listen to any of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t mind even if you do. I’m sure you missed his voice.”</p><p> </p><p>Ji-Woo smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “I do, terribly so,” she said with a sigh as her eyes traveled to the pictures on the wall. For a while, none of them speak, Hokuto forced himself to finish his croissant, and Ji-Woo resumed packing, while the weather outside became ferocious, adding bleakness to their already doleful mood.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyway,” Ji-Woo said after a while. “I think he left 40 messages, because of that belief that human souls can stay 40 days on earth before they go to heaven. This is the 9th day since his death, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you listen to his voice messages number 1 to 9.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll listen to it one of these days-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Ji-Woo snapped. “You will listen to it today, or tonight, but you will definitely have to do it before the day ends. You will never put off what you can do today. By tomorrow, you will listen to number 10 and so on until his 40th day.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm-”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I regret the most?” She cuts in, her face turning red. “I should have resigned from work the moment I learned about his cancer. I should have spent more time with him. I should have become that clingy fiancé. Because now that he’s gone, I realized that nothing else matters if he’s not with me…”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto walked to Ji-Woo’s side and hugged her as she cried. He started crying, too. The pain of regret rained on them in the shape of knives, giving them unimaginable pain that would probably haunt them forever. </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Hoks…if you’re listening to this, that means I’ve gone to the other side. That means I’m now a ghost and I can see you flog yourself off. Go get yourself a girl, mate. When was the last time you got a gobby? HAHAHAHA. Seriously mate, smog must be low at the moment, I think I can see the Milky Way and your Big Dipper. Big Dipper is in the Milky Way, right? Or not? But whatever, look out from your window, and every time you see the Big Dipper, I’ve become part of that now….So cheesy I’m getting bloody goosebumps. I’m not good with this. You’re the one who’s always good with words, mine’s just half swearin, but once I’m gone, will we still be looking at the same sky? Can I still see the Big Dipper over there and I’ll tell all the other spirits that the Big Dipper is my best mate’s name? Hokuto. I never want to forget that."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Hokuto just finished one recording and he had to pause, he probably cried more now than back at the funeral. Listening to Brian’s voice, which sounded like he was trying not to break down as well was too painful. How could he survive 39 more voice clips? It was too overwhelming for him that he followed Brian’s advice and opened his apartment window. The rain just finished and he could only sigh at the distant lights from Darling Harbour; he'd gotten so used to city lights, treating them like his very own galaxy that he never bothered looking up at the sky. He did as what Brian instructed, but massive clouds obscured his view, it would probably rain again, and definitely not the time for him to search for his namesake’s star. He took a deep breath, braced himself, and played another file. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Hoks…I was serious when I said you would join us on our honeymoon. We always wanted to backpack up there isn’t it? But we got so busy, we never thought we could find jobs right after Uni! Jeju would be our first destination because Ji-Woo said it’s sort of a Korean tradition for honeymoon, then we’ll go to Busan to meet her nana,  then to Japan where you will tour us to your hometown, then to Beijing because of bloody Wang Yibo whom Ji-Woo goes cray about. Then, we’ll head over to bloody Kim Jong-Un. HAHAHAHA…I can’t believe I’m dying and the only country I’ve been to is Bali…which is a country, right? I can no longer travel, Hoks, but you still can, and I hope you try to see the world…before the world sees you off."</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“In one of my favorite novels, The Timekeeper, it reminds us that time is the great equalizer. Everyone has 24 hrs. at their disposal. What will you do with your 24 hours?” Hokuto asked, sighing as his class’s attention is now on the clock above him, all of them waiting for the clock to strike at 2 pm. </p><p> </p><p>“Answer that question with a 300-words essay.” His class’s attention is now back on him, some simply groan, while others openly whinge that they still have to review for midterms and so. </p><p> </p><p>“That will be my parting assignment to all of you,” Hokuto added and silence fell in his class. He smiled softly and continued, “I already prepared your midterm exam, but a new professor will be giving it to you next week and he will be the one to grade it as well. Earlier, I talked about time being a great equalizer, but there’s an even greater equalizer, and that’s death. You and I will die. So maximize all the time you have, and don’t bet on your youth, because once the time is up, we can never get it back. Goodbye and good luck with your midterms.”</p><p> </p><p>The class started clapping as the bell rang, Hokuto waved them off and quickly stepped out of the room. Hokuto thought he would leave his job with a heavy heart, he loved teaching, and he really thought of it as his calling. But as he checked himself, he wasn’t that sad, or maybe because he had experienced a greater deal of sadness, and nothing had managed to top it off yet. </p><p> </p><p>His phone rang and he could only bite his lower lip seeing his older sister’s name. “Nee-sama” he answered.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you out of your mind? Did you really resign?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you tell mom and dad?” asked Hokuto immediately. Although their parents are financially independent, they are also the usual immigrant Asian parents who would beat his ass once they knew that he resigned from his work. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I’m not crazy, I told them you’re going to an exchange teaching something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! That’s a good alibi. I never thought of that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t flatter me, brother, what are you planning to do?” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed and paused from walking. The weather had gotten colder, leaves started to turn in shades of yellow and red, while others simply fell. </p><p> </p><p>“I just want to take a break,” he said with a sigh, his eyes in the sky.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you’re grieving, but don’t make permanent decisions because of this.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed again. “It may not look like it, but I’m doing this more for myself,” he said slowly. He was never the type to talk about his feelings to his family. He found it embarrassing, if not, he saw it as a weakness.  </p><p>“I’m grieving, I acknowledge that, and I want to face this grief. I don’t want to keep on working and act like everything is okay, I want to give myself time; time for everything else I ignored before.” </p><p> </p><p>There was silence at the other line, Hokuto even thought he lost his sister. Until she spoke again, her voice close to breaking. “You will be back, right?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, I am.” </p><p> </p><p>“Call or send me a message every day, or if you’re such a bludger, you can just send me your coordinates, GPS, or whatever to show that you’re still alive.” </p><p> </p><p>“I will,” Hokuto promised. “I’ll send you pictures every day.” </p><p> </p><p>“Take care of yourself out there.” </p><p> </p><p>“I will. Look out after mom and dad.” </p><p> </p><p>“You know I will. If you’re free, drop by lunch tomorrow, the kids want us to celebrate St. Paddy’s like everyone else, so I’m making corned beef and baked cabbage and you can have Guinness with your brother-in-law.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I’ll be there.”</p><p> </p><p>The phone call ended and Hokuto looked back at the sky. The next time he was looking at the same sky, he was on the plane to Jeju Island. </p><p>
