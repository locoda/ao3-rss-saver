    <h2 class="toc-heading">Happy Birthday Kyomo</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>‚ÄúJesse sent me a text, he was the first to greet me, then Kochi. The members are all busy you know~‚Äù This is what Taiga said to fans who watched his IG live when asked if members greeted him for his birthday.</p><p>‚ÄúAin‚Äôt I the first to greet you though?‚Äù Juri protested while his fingers are playing with Taiga‚Äôs long hair locks, the now 30-year old, humming calmly while his head is lying on Juri‚Äôs chest and playing on his phone. Taiga went straight to Juri‚Äôs apartment after his IG live since he was not able to spend his birthday with his boyfriend.</p><p>‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù Taiga chuckled softly, his eyes fluttering shut as Juri's touch grew more gentle, the hum of his voice vibrating through the younger man's chest. "Well, if you did, it must've slipped my mind," he teased, a hint of warmth in his tone. "But no, you're not the first. Jesse beat you to it. His message bas a timestamp. See?" He felt Juri's grip on his hair tighten slightly in mock annoyance when Taiga showed him the text, but the playfulness remained in the air, a comfortable banter settling between them as they lay there.</p><p>Juri smirked, his fingers moving to Taiga‚Äôs earlobe and rubbing it between his fingers gently. "But don‚Äôt you remember?" he said with a mischievous grin, "I greeted you in a very... special way. Right here, in this very bed." Taiga's cheeks flushed at the sudden vivid memory that flooded his mind. The vigorous sounds of their passionate encounter from the night before echoed in his thoughts as Juri's fingertips traced the outline of his ear. "I woke you up with a birthday surprise," Juri reminded him, his voice low and filled with amusement. Taiga couldn't help but let out a small laugh, the intimacy of their shared moment bringing a smile to his lips. "I suppose that does count," he conceded, his heart skipping a beat at the thought of Juri's passionate greeting.</p><p>"Well, if you're keeping score," Taiga retorted with a cheeky smile, his eyes still closed as he enjoyed the sensation of Juri's touch, "you might want to consider telling the fans about the... unique way you chose to wake me up." He paused, a smirk playing on his lips. "Would you like me to mention that my birthday gift was getting fucked into oblivion by my dear bandmate?" Juri's touch on Taiga‚Äôs ear continued, his chuckles reverberating through his chest. "Now that would be a story to tell, wouldn't it?" Taiga's voice was a mix of teasing and challenge, the atmosphere in the room charged with the electricity of their shared secret. As idols, they could not exactly tell the whole world they‚Äôre dating. Although there are quite a few times they could not keep their hands to themselves on camera and fans have probably already assumed they are in fact dating. He felt Juri's body tense up with excitement. This made Taiga smirk as he discarded his phone and flipped so he‚Äôs now meetinf Juri‚Äôs gaze a she propped his arm and chin over juri‚Äôs chest, their faces closer now. The younger man's hand moved to caress Taiga‚Äôs cheek as he leaned in even closer, their faces now mere inches apart. "Maybe I'll save that little detail for when we're all having drinks together on live," Juri murmured, his gaze locked onto Taiga's, a glint of desire in his eyes. Taiga's breath hitched at the thought, his heart racing in anticipation of the potential reactions from their fans and friends. Despite the nature of their banter, the intimacy of their words remained strictly between them, a testament to the unspoken bond that had grown over the years. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry the candle on your cake earlier was a bit small. Well, if you‚Äôd like a bigger one, I do have something to offer.‚Äù Juri smirked, the tent on his pants inviting Taiga. He‚Äôd been hard since they‚Äôve recollected the intimate night they had before.</p><p>Taiga had a mischievous grin playing on his lips as he looked up at Juri. "Oh yeah?," he said, his eyes sparkling with amusement. He shifted his body so that his head was now level with Juri's crotch, the bulge in the younger man's pants already making itself known. Taiga leaned in, his warm breath ghosting over the fabric. "But if I go lower, you have to promise to keep the details a secret," he whispered playfully, his gaze never leaving Juri's as he nuzzled the hot tent on Juri‚Äôs pants. Juri's eyes darkened with lust, his hand tangling in Taiga's hair as he gently guided his head closer. "I can keep a secret," Juri rasped, his voice thick with desire. Taiga's smile widened, and with a playful wink, he took the hint, his lips pressing against the material of Juri's pants in a soft kiss before he started to unbuckle his belt, eager to unveil the treat that awaited him.</p><p>Juri's smirk grew wider as he watched Taiga's eyes light up with excitement. "Go ahead, blow out your candle," he said, his voice a seductive purr as he lifted his hips slightly, allowing Taiga better access to the growing bulge in his pants. Taiga's cheeks burned with both embarrassment and arousal as he took in the sight before him. He knew exactly what Juri was suggesting and couldn't resist the temptation. With a quick nod, he leaned in, his eyes locked on Juri's as he pulled the boxers. The tip of Juri's cock peeked out, already hard and eager for attention. Taiga's breath hitched as he took it in, the heat of the moment making him feel lightheaded. He wrapped his lips around the head of Juri's cock, giving it a gentle suck as if it were indeed a candle that needed to be blown out. Juri's eyes rolled back in his head, a low moan escaping his lips as Taiga's mouth began to work its magic. Taiga took the challenge seriously, his tongue swirling and his mouth moving with a rhythm that had Juri's hips bucking against him. The room was filled with the sweet sound of wet suction and the occasional gasp of pleasure, the only soundtrack to this intimate, private celebration of Taiga's birthday.</p><p>Juri's moans grew louder, his voice a mix of pleasure and praise as Taiga's lips and tongue worked their magic. "Fuck, Kyomo," he breathed out, his hips moving in sync with the rhythm Taiga had set, his fingers running and gripping on Taiga‚Äôs wonderful long hair. "You're so good at this," he complimented, his voice thick with lust. Taiga's eyes glinted with mirth, even as he bobbed his head faster, taking more of Juri's length into his mouth. He pulled back just enough to murmur, "Mmhmm," before diving back in. Juri's grip on Taiga's hair tightened, his voice strained as he spoke. "And I've got some icing saved for you, too," he said, his eyes glinting with mischief. "Do you want it on your face?" Taiga's eyes widened at the suggestion, a thrill of excitement coursing through him. He nodded eagerly, the thought of Juri's cum as a birthday treat making him even more eager to please. Juri's grin grew even wider, his breathing hitching as Taiga's mouth continued to glide over his shaft.</p><p>Juri's hand tightened in Taiga's hair, his hips jerking upwards as Taiga's mouth worked tirelessly on his cock. "Fuck, your mouth looks so beautiful on me," Juri groaned, his eyes half-lidded with pleasure. He watched as Taiga's cheeks hollowed and his throat bobbed, the sight of his boyfriend pleasuring him sending waves of ecstasy through his body. "You're such a good little birthday boy," he whispered, the compliment, though sounds innocent, only served to fuel Taiga's passion. Taiga's eyes fluttered shut, his own cock straining against the fabric of his pants as he took Juri's length deeper into his throat. The feeling of power that Juri's words gave him was intoxicating, making him want to push the limits of what they could do together. He swirled his tongue around the head, savoring the taste of pre-cum, before pulling back to catch his breath, only to be met with Juri's hungry gaze. "Keep going," Juri urged, his voice strained with need. "Make me cum, Kyomo. Show me how much you want that icing on your face." Taiga's eyes snapped open, his resolve set. He took Juri's cock back into his mouth, his hands gripping the base as he increased his pace, eager to taste the sweet release that was building within him. The air grew thick with tension as Juri's breathing grew ragged, his body tensing as he approached climax. Taiga could feel the younger man's thighs quivering under his palms, his own arousal reaching fever pitch as he listened to Juri's moans of pleasure. He knew that this was a moment that would be etched into their shared history, a secret that would only strengthen the bond between them.</p><p>Juri's grip on Taiga's hair grew even tighter as he neared his peak, his hips bucking uncontrollably. "Kyomo, Kyomo," he chanted, his voice hoarse with pleasure. "Get off, I'm gonna cum," he warned, his voice strained and desperate. Taiga obeyed, pulling back, his face still close and watching with eager anticipation as Juri's cock pulsed in front of him, pre-cum already decorating his face like the promised icing. With a final, guttural moan, Juri's release spurted out, painting Taiga's cheeks and mouth in a hot, sticky mess of white. Taiga's eyes sparkled with delight, his tongue darting out to catch a rogue droplet that had landed on his bottom lip. He licked it clean, savoring the taste, and then spoke in a breathy voice, "I want more," egging Juri on to continue the sensual assault on his face. The younger man's hand didn't waver, continuing to stroke himself through his orgasm, making sure every drop was accounted for as he painted Taiga's features with his cum. Taiga has his tongue out, ready to take in any of the thick cum in his mouth. The intimate scene was a celebration of their closeness, a testament to the depth of their relationship that transcended the boundaries of societal norms.</p><p>Juri's chest heaved with satisfaction as he watched Taiga's tongue dart out to catch the rogue droplets of cum on his face, his eyes never leaving Juri's as he licked his fingers clean. The room was heavy with the scent of sex and desire, their bond stronger than ever. Taiga's gaze was filled with a mix of lust and adoration, his eyes never leaving Juri's as he savored the taste of their shared pleasure. Juri's cock twitched in his hand, not quite finished with the celebration. He sat up pulling Taiga on him, capturing Taiga's mouth in a passionate kiss, their tongues entwining as they shared the salty remnants of Juri's orgasm. The kiss grew more intense, their bodies pressing closer together as if trying to become one. Taiga's hand found its way to Juri's still-hard cock, stroking it gently as they kissed, eager to return the favor. Juri broke away, a smug grin on his face as he watched Taiga's pupils dilate with want. "You're insatiable," he murmured, his voice a mix of amazement and affection. Taiga chuckled, his cheeks still flushed from the recent attention. "Only for you," he replied, his eyes gleaming with mischief as he pushed Juri back onto the bed, ready to continue the festivities.</p><p>With a playful wink, Taiga began to peel off his clothes, his body a clean canvas of milky smooth skin, with plumpness just on the right places that glistened in the soft light of the room. He reached over to the bedside table and pulled out a bottle of lube, the sound of the cap being twisted off echoing through the room. Turning around so his back is facing Juri, he bent over slightly, presenting his firm, round ass to the younger man. He coated his fingers in the slick substance before sliding them down his crack, the coolness of the lube a stark contrast to the warmth of his body. Looking over his shoulder, Taiga raised an eyebrow and spoke in a sultry voice, "Think you can fit some icing in here too?" His voice was filled with a hint of challenge, the mischief in his eyes unmistakable as he waited for Juri's reaction. Juri's eyes widened, his cock twitching at the sight before him. He nodded eagerly, the smirk on his face growing into a full-blown grin. "Fuck yeah," he murmured, his voice thick with desire as he watched Taiga prepare himself, the image of his boyfriend‚Äôs tight hole glistening with lube making his stomach clench with excitement. Taiga chuckled, his cheeks flushing slightly at Juri's enthusiasm. He knew that this wasn‚Äôt a new level of intimacy for them, but the thrill of exploring it together again was too tempting to resist. He applied more lube, taking his time to spread it evenly before slipping a finger inside himself, the sensation making him gasp softly. Juri's eyes never left him, his own hand moving to stroke his cock back to life as he watched Taiga's body react to his own touch. The room was filled with the sound of their breathing, the anticipation palpable as they pushed the boundaries of their relationship even further. Taiga leaned forward onto the bed, his ass in the air as he beckoned Juri closer, ready to see just how much of Juri‚Äôs ‚Äòicing‚Äô he could handle.</p><p>With a seductive smile, Taiga looked at Juri, his eyes dark with desire as he leaned his upper body onto the bed, spreading his legs invitingly. "What are you waiting for?" he purred, reaching back to spread his cheeks apart, revealing his slicked-up hole. "Come on, fill me up with that sweet icing," he begged, his voice dripping with need. Juri's eyes widened, his cock standing at full attention as he took in the erotic sight before him. Without another word, he positioned himself at Taiga's entrance, his tip teasing the tight ring of muscle. Taiga's breath hitched in anticipation as Juri pushed inside, the sensation of fullness making him moan with pleasure. The older man's eyes never left Juri's despite the difficult position, the connection between them burning with passion as the younger man began to thrust in and out. Each stroke was met with a wanton gasp from Taiga, his body arching to meet Juri's eager movements. "That's it," Taiga murmured, his voice breathless. "Fuck me like it's my birthday all over again." Juri's movements grew more erratic, his breath coming in pants as he stared down at their joined bodies. "I'm going to make you feel so good," Juri promised, his voice strained as he pushed deeper, eager to give Taiga everything he craved. Taiga's eyes rolled back in his head, his moans growing louder as he felt the familiar build-up of pleasure, the feeling of Juri inside him mixing with the sticky warmth of his cum on his skin. He knew this was a moment they'd both remember forever, a secret shared between them that would only make their bond stronger.</p><p>Taiga's moans grew louder, filling the room with the sweet symphony of their passion as Juri's hips slapped against his ass, each powerful thrust sending shockwaves of pleasure through his body. "Harder, Juri, harder‚Ä¶ Ngh!" Taiga begged, his voice a ragged growl as he pushed back to meet each of Juri's movements. The sound of skin meeting skin echoed through the air, punctuating their harsh breaths and the slick sounds of their bodies moving together. Juri's eyes were wild with desire, his grip on Taiga's hips tightening as he pounded into him with an unbridled fervor that left them both panting and desperate for more. Taiga's hands clawed at the bedsheets, his knuckles white with the effort of holding on as Juri's cock hit all the right spots, driving him closer and closer to the edge of ecstasy.</p><p>"Don't stop, Juri," Taiga gasped, his voice hoarse with need as he pushed back onto the younger man's cock, his body begging for more. "Give it to me good, harder..! Ngh right there, oh fuck, yes, yes!" The words tumbled out of his mouth in a stream of dirty praise, his body undulating with each punishing thrust. Juri's eyes narrowed, his teeth clenched with the effort of maintaining control as he slammed into Taiga with an intensity that spoke of his own desperation to please his lover. Taiga's cheeks were flushed, his eyes screwed shut in pleasure as he chanted, "Don't stop, don't stop," his voice a mix of desperation and bliss. The words "fuck harder" were a mantra on his lips, urging Juri to push him further, to claim him completely in this celebration of their love. Juri's hips pistoned faster, his cock driving deep into Taiga's willing body, the sound of their passion growing louder with each passing second. The room was alive with the electricity of their desire, the air thick with the promise of their release as they raced towards climax, their hearts beating as one, their bodies speaking a language that only they understood.</p><p>Taiga's body tightened around Juri's cock as he pushed back with a fervent need, his moan turning into a full-throated scream when Juri's shaft hit the spot that sent him spiraling into pure ecstasy. "Right there! Keep fucking me there Juri.." he panted, his voice trembling with desire. He reached back to grab Juri's hand, guiding it to his chest. "Touch me, Juri, please," he begged, his voice thick with passion. Juri's eyes never left Taiga's, his own arousal reaching new heights as he watched the raw pleasure on his boyfriend‚Äôs face. He pinched Taiga's nipple, twisting it gently as he continued to drive into him, feeling the older man's body respond to his touch with a shiver of pleasure. Taiga's hips bucked back, his body begging for more as Juri's hand moved to wrap around his cock, stroking him in time with his thrusts. "Harder, faster," Taiga chanted, his voice breaking as tears of pleasure rolled down his cheeks. "I'm so close, don't stop," he pleaded, his body on the brink of an explosive orgasm. Juri's own need grew more urgent, his strokes becoming more erratic as he felt Taiga's tight channel clench around him, desperate for release. Taiga's eyes squeezed shut, his teeth gritted as he took everything Juri had to give, his body shaking with the intensity of his climb towards climax.</p><p>Taiga's screams of "Yes, yes! More, Juri!" filled the room, his body writhing under the onslaught of pleasure as Juri's hand tightened around his nipple, pinching it mercilessly. The sting of pain melded with the exquisite sensation of Juri's cock stretching him open, sending him soaring higher with each powerful thrust. Juri's voice was a guttural growl in his ear, his breath hot and ragged as he whispered, "You‚Äôre so sexy, Kyomo. So tight, so perfect for me." Taiga could feel the pressure building within him, the coil of pleasure winding tighter and tighter with each movement. His back arched, pushing his chest towards Juri's hand when Juri lifted him so his back is against Juri‚Äôs chest, begging for more of that sweet torment. Juri's grip grew tighter, his strokes more erratic as he lost himself in the beauty of their union, whispering dirty words of praise that only served to push Taiga closer to the edge. The room was a blur of sensation, a whirlwind of passion that threatened to consume them both as they chased their shared climax, the air thick with the scent of sweat and desire. Taiga's voice grew hoarse from screaming, his body a tapestry of pleasure and pain as he felt himself begin to shatter, his orgasm building like a storm within him. He knew that when it finally broke, it would be earth-shattering, a culmination of a night that had already been filled with more passion and love than he had ever thought possible. And as Juri's thrusts grew even more frenzied, as the younger man's hand worked his cock in time with the rhythm of their fucking, Taiga knew that this was just the beginning of their passionate night.</p><p>Taiga‚Äôs head rolled back onto Juri's shoulder as the latter's hips pounded into him with an intensity that stole his breath away. "So hard, so deep," Taiga panted, his voice a symphony of pleasure and need. "Your cock feels so big, so good inside me," he moaned, his body trembling with each powerful thrust. "I love it, Juri, love how you fill me up, how you claim me like this." His words were a desperate plea for more, for Juri to never stop, to never leave him wanting. "I want your icing deep inside me," Taiga begged, his voice a raw whisper that sent a shiver down Juri's spine. "Cum in me, Juri, fill me up," Taiga urged, his body tightening around Juri's shaft as if trying to draw out his climax. The air was thick with the scent of sex and desire, their breaths mingling as they danced closer and closer to the edge of euphoria. Juri's grip on Taiga's hips tightened, his own body straining to give his lover what he craved, the sound of their flesh slapping together a testament to the unbridled passion that burned between them. "You're mine, Kyomo," Juri growled, his voice a mix of love and possession as he hammered into Taiga, the promise of his release building with every thrust. Taiga could feel the pressure building within him, his body a live wire of sensation as he clung to Juri, their bodies moving in perfect sync. The promise of Juri's cum inside him was like a siren's song, beckoning him closer to the precipice of pleasure. "Yes, yes," Taiga hissed, his eyes squeezed shut in ecstasy. "Make me yours," he whispered, his voice a breathless invocation as Juri's cock continued its relentless assault on his body. The room was their sanctuary, their playground, a place where their love knew no bounds and their desires were the only law.</p><p>With a final, guttural cry, Taiga felt his orgasm crash over him, his cock spurting hot jets of cum that painted the sheets beneath them. The intensity of his climax sent waves of pleasure coursing through his body, making his muscles clench around Juri's cock, which was still buried deep inside him. The feel of Taiga‚Äôs tight channel pulsing around him was too much for Juri to bear, and with a roar of his own, he followed suit, his cock releasing a torrent of cum that filled Taiga to the brim. The two men collapsed onto the bed in a sweaty, sticky heap, their bodies trembling with the aftershocks of their shared release. They remained there for a moment, panting and gasping for air, their hearts racing in unison. As the haze of passion began to clear, Juri leaned in to kiss Taiga, their lips coming together in a soft, tender embrace that was a stark contrast to the ferocity of their lovemaking. The kiss was sticky with cum, a sweet reminder of the intimacy they had just shared. They pulled apart, chuckling softly at the mess they had created, their eyes sparkling with the joy of their secret celebration. "Happy birthday, Kyomo," Juri murmured, his voice filled with love and satisfaction as they lay there, entwined in each other's arms. Taiga‚Äôs laughter was breathless and genuine, the warmth of Juri's affection filling him up in a way that no fan greeting or birthday present ever could. "Thank you, Juri," he whispered, his eyes shining. "This was the best present I could ever ask for."</p>
