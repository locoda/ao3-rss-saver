    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>“Once there were two lovers, whose love is considered a sin, thus, they were banished to this forest. They were never to mingle with the common folk, until one day, a beautiful sorceress in disguise arrived in the forest. She was on the verge of death and the lovers nursed her back to health. Little did they know, the sorceress had fallen for one of them and she intended to have him. When the sorceress was strong again, she showed her real identity to the lovers and told them that she would give them a chance to correct their most grievous mistake. But there’s a catch, once their mistake is corrected, their memories of their lover will be erased, and they shall never meet again. Surprisingly, one-half of the lovers took her offer, and his wish was so unprecedented-”</p><p> </p><p>“Kouchi, where are the crackers?” </p><p> </p><p>“-even the sorceress couldn’t believe it that he would-”</p><p> </p><p>“Kouchi, where are the crackers?” </p><p> </p><p>“Can the paper driver shut up?” Shintaro roared at Taiga, who was sitting in the back seat. “I’m telling daddy a story.” </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think daddy is interested though, and your story is full of inconsistencies. Lovers banished to the forest? Why? Can they just move to the next town? Also, a sorceress on the verge of death? That means she’s not very good with magic if she can’t make a spell for food or medicine. Oh, another thing, correcting a mistake? Seriously? That’s such a lame reward.” </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro rolled his eyes in annoyance. “You obviously don’t know anything about the legend of this place.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you made it up, or it’s one of those Korean dramas you watch,” Taiga countered. </p><p> </p><p>“Certainly not. Although I agree that the plot sounds very K-drama-ish, that’s not the point-” </p><p> </p><p>“Kids.” Kouchi, the driver and “daddy” to Shintaro and Taiga, finally spoke. “Can you guys keep your mouth shut even for a minute?” His tone might be mild, but the two passengers can detect simmering anger. However, it wouldn’t stop Taiga's sassiness. </p><p> </p><p>“You should have stopped Shintaro earlier,” Taiga quipped. </p><p> </p><p>Kouchi immediately hit the brakes, which propelled all of them forward if it weren’t for the seat belt. </p><p> </p><p>“You guys can’t really shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the one who talked!” Shintaro said. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, out of the car, both of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Daddy!” They both complained.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not your fucking dad!” He glared toward Taiga. “We’re fucking born in the same year, and you-” he roared to Shintaro, “this camping trip was your idea, but not only did I have to drive, but I was also the one who prepared all the fucking equipment!”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga and Shintaro were too shocked to react, after all, “daddy” rarely gets mad toward them. </p><p> </p><p>“You both have your phones, which I’m sure both have GPS, so you may start walking to the campsite.” </p><p> </p><p>“Eh?” </p><p> </p><p>“Eh?” Kouchi repeated sarcastically. “Get out of my car now or we’re all going back to Tokyo.” </p><p> </p><p>“We can’t!” Shintaro said with his eyes wide, “you know that I’m trying to avoid someone.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not avoiding anyone but it’s sweltering hot in Tokyo right now, and my AC got sent for repairs for dying.” </p><p> </p><p>“See? Since both of you don’t want to go back to Tokyo, start walking to the campsite now.”</p><p> </p><p>“We promised to be completely silent,” Taiga begged. “You won’t even know we’re here.” </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro nodded repeatedly. “Yes, please, Kouchi.”</p><p> </p><p>Kouchi shook his head, completely undeterred. “Nada. Out. Now.” </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“I still think we should have stayed by the roadside, which is concrete, and we can even hitch-hike,” Taiga complained as the mossy-veiled trail and steep slope forest they were traveling as a shortcut grew denser. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure this is a shortcut?” He asked as he looked up, the sky was blue and cloudless. </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro turned back to him, his thick eyebrows forming a v-shape. “The GPS says so,” he said, tapping his phone, “and as long as we have a signal, it only means that we’re still within civilization. Why? Are you getting scared?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga scoffed. “Please, I’m going to eat a snake if I see one.” </p><p> </p><p>“We’re already halfway there,” Shintaro said, checking his phone again, “we can even slow down a bit so we’re sure that Kouchi has put up the tent by the time we arrive.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga scowled at first, but he ended up smiling at Shintaro’s idea. “Good idea. I hope he starts cooking the pizza as well.” </p><p> </p><p>They resumed walking, not hurrying, but not slowing their pace either. Taiga didn’t like camping, but he is an avid hiker because of his <em> goshuin </em> hobby, and with “forest bathing”, he felt like his lungs had been cleaned from all the dust and smog of the city. Moreover, even though they’d been walking for quite some time, he didn’t think he even had a bead of sweat. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah!” Shintaro hollered, which surprised him. “Look!” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked on and saw a reflective road sign that read, “200m to the camping site”. </p><p> </p><p>“See? The GPS is correct.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded in awe. “I’m impressed as well.” </p><p> </p><p>“Let’s dash to daddy!” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga was about to reply when Shintaro really made a run, he was so flabbergasted that if it wasn’t for the coos of the crows, he wouldn’t start running as well. </p><p> </p><p>“Shintaro! Slow down!” He shouted as he tried to speed up, but he knew it would be impossible since he was never a fast runner. </p><p> </p><p>“Shintaro! Wait-” He yelped as he almost flew and rolled a few feet away. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck that hurts,” he muttered as the forest floor became shrouded with mist. He tried to stand but his left ankle screamed in agony. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit! Shintaro!” He yelled as he looked around a forest with almost zero visibility. “Why is it suddenly misty? Are these mist or clouds? God, I hope it won’t rain or something,” he murmured as he opened his phone and saw that he had no signal.</p><p> </p><p>“Eh? I’m sure I have one earlier.” He looked up and saw that the earlier blue sky had turned gray. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit! It might really rain. Shintaro! Kouchi!” He called out once more while he waved his phone around for a signal when he heard the rustle of dried leaves. </p><p> </p><p>“Shintaro, is that you? I think I sprained my ankle.” </p><p> </p><p>The rustling grew nearer and faster. Taiga thinks that Shintaro was probably running, and he could also make out a light growing brighter beneath the mist. </p><p> </p><p>He turned on the flashlight of his phone and shouted, “I’m over here!” </p><p> </p><p>Leaves and twigs cracked with each footstep until Taiga could make out a shadow.</p><p> </p><p>“Shin-”</p><p> </p><p>“Young Master, where were you?” </p><p> </p><p>A figure stepped out from the mist and Taiga found himself more mesmerized than terrified. The man looked down at him, gently steering the old-fashioned arabic lamp that hangs on a stick near his face, and Taiga could finally make out the man’s features. He has a well-chiseled face, which looks soft with him, almost puppy-ish, instead of sharp, and his straight black hair was shiny and looked soft to the touch. He was tall and lean and the white linen suit he was wearing made him look like a deity who came down to shower the mortals with their beauty.  </p><p> </p><p>If he was dazzled by the man in front of him, Taiga could tell that the man was not only surprised to see him, he wasn’t at all thrilled. </p><p> </p><p>“Errr…are you from the campsite?” He asked. He doubted the man’s outfit was something one would wear camping, and he wondered if he and Shintaro might have gone to private property. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, you got lost from the campsite?” He asked in a tone suggesting that this wasn’t the first time someone got lost from the site. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga slowly shook his head. “I’ve never been to the campsite, I’m on my way there,” he clarified. </p><p> </p><p>He sighed as though he was about to do something against his will. “Stand, I’ll guide you back to the campsite.” </p><p> </p><p>“Uhm, I won’t be sitting here if I could stand,” he said, pointing his phone’s flashlight to his injured ankle, which was now swollen. “That looks bad,” he added, a bit frightened. </p><p> </p><p>The man sighed once more. </p><p> </p><p>“Uhm, you don’t need to help me, can I just borrow your phone? Mine doesn't have any signal. Or perhaps, do you have a radio or something?” </p><p> </p><p>“There’s no signal around here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh? But my friend has one earlier-” </p><p> </p><p>The man stretched an arm toward him. “I’ll help you to stand on your foot, then I’ll carry you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Eh…I’m heavy,” Taiga muttered, he felt shy all of a sudden. </p><p> </p><p>“I can manage, let’s go before I change my mind.” </p><p> </p><p>He was still hesitant, but as soon as their hands touched, the man pulled him up to stand on his right foot, before guiding him for a piggyback ride. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re right. You’re heavy,” he complained, grunting as he adjusted Taiga’s weight on him. “Take the lamp with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took the lamp, feeling his face hot as a familiar smell wafted toward him. “Mmmm, you smell of lavender.” </p><p> </p><p>“You smell of wood,” the man replied. </p><p> </p><p>“As you should! We’re in the forest! I doubt there’s a lavender field here, but is there one nearby?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why do you need to know?” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, I always dream of waking up in a field of lavender, and I’ve been to a lot of lavender fields, but no one comes close to the one in my dreams.” </p><p> </p><p>“Because it’s just a dream,” the man said with sarcasm.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” he mumbled, he didn’t have the energy to contradict a man who was suffering his weight. “It is all but a dream. By the way, were you looking for someone? I think I heard you say, <em> young master </em>?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I am looking for someone.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Once we’re near the campsite, you can just drop me off and I’ll crawl or roll my way there, the kid might be scared in this forest.” </p><p> </p><p>“Kid? What makes you think the young master is a kid?” </p><p> </p><p>“He’s not?” </p><p> </p><p>“Well…he wished he was young.”</p><p> </p><p>The man walked more, the mist started clearing, and Taiga didn’t think he was gone that long as darkness cloaked the forest. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where? Oh! How did this happen?” Taiga asked, confused to see the same sign he and Shintaro saw earlier. He recalled running and tripping on something, but he didn’t think he rolled back. </p><p> </p><p>“Is your name…Taiga?” The man asked, speaking his name in a soft whisper. </p><p> </p><p>“How did you know?” </p><p> </p><p>“I can hear them calling for you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Taiga tried to concentrate, but he couldn’t hear anything, not even the sound of the wind. “Your huge ears can hear that far?” </p><p> </p><p>The man simply smiled and helped him down to lean on a tree. He looked in the direction where he and Shintaro ran earlier. </p><p> </p><p>“They are coming soon. I must leave as well, I can already hear the young master calling for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga scowled as he couldn’t hear anything else. “You can really hear that well? Is that a superpower? Are you…a superhero?” He asked with extreme interest. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just…I’m no one,” he said and Taiga could feel the harrow in his tone. “Goodbye, Taiga.” </p><p> </p><p>“Wait! You know my name, I should also know yours.” </p><p> </p><p>The man looked up, Taiga looked up as well and saw the sky draped with stars. </p><p> </p><p>“You can see my name up there.” </p><p> </p><p>“Up there? What do you mean-” He shone his phone’s flashlight around the darkness. How could the man disappear in a flash? He took a deep breath, the floral and woodsy smell of lavender still lingered nearby. </p><p> </p><p>“Where are you?” He asked when he heard Shintaro and Kouchi’s frantic voices calling for him. He cleared his throat and bellowed, “I’m here!” </p><p> </p><p>Soon, he heard barking, more crackling sounds, and breaking twigs as the spots of lights grew nearer to him. </p><p> </p><p>“Taiga!” Kouchi and Shintaro both shouted.  </p><p> </p><p>“Where were you? We’ve circled this place around three times!” Kouchi said and before Taiga could answer, Kouchi noticed his ankle. “You’re injured!”</p><p> </p><p>Uniformed rescuers immediately helped him and transferred him to a spinal board. Taiga couldn’t say a word as they all marched back toward the campsite and he could only sigh as the smell of lavender grew fainter and fainter. </p><p>
