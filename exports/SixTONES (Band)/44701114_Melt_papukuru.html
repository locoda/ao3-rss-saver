    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>It was hot.</p><p>This year was just as hot as the last.</p><p>No.</p><p>Hokuto took that back.</p><p>It was much hotter than last year.</p><p>He could blame it on global warming or on his expensive AC or even that his apartment faced the sun at peak temperatures.</p><p>But the main reason was his boyfriend that was sprawled out on his bed, wearing thin to little amounts of clothing.</p><p>"Ahhh… it's so hot…" Taiga sighed as he dug his fingers through his long blonde hair, pushing the strands from his forehead. "Remind me again why you don't turn on the AC?"</p><p>Hokuto scratched down notes on his paper as he sat at his desk, doing his best to ignore the heat and his boyfriend's overly exposed body. "The energy prices are going up and my job doesn't pay enough to let me keep it on… Also, if you came here just to complain, then why don't you head home?"</p><p>"... Do you want me to go home?"</p><p>"No-!" Hokuto swung around in his chair to look at Taiga as Taiga propped himself up on his elbows to meet his eyes.</p><p>A lump instantly grew in his throat.</p><p>He had to fight to keep his eyes from wandering over the sleeveless top that exposed the sides and chest of Taiga's porcelain skin, leaving little to the imagination, as well as the high ride shorts that left his long smooth legs on display.</p><p>He turned back to his work.</p><p>"No. I'm sorry… Of course I like having you here. I just don't want you to suffer through the heat just to be here with me." Hokuto said, swallowing hard and tightening his grip on his pen to bring back his focus.</p><p>Taiga smiled to himself as he laid back down.</p><p>"Why are you doing your summer school work now, anyways? You have plenty of time until the summer ends."</p><p>"I like to get it done early… It lets me enjoy all of my summer instead of having to waste the last few days cramming in all the work at once like Juri."</p><p>"Mnn… I see… I should have done that." Taiga chuckled.</p><p>Taiga had graduated in the spring. He was able to pick up work rather quickly, doing freelance composition pieces for companies that commissioned him, but for the most part, it just meant that Taiga had the free time to spend with Hokuto.</p><p>And lay on his bed while he worked.</p><p>The fan was humming in the background, doing its best to cool the bodies in the room, but as it turned slowly from side to side, it only brought temporary relief each time it turned to them. Hokuto wiped the traces of sweat from his forehead before turning the page of his notes to continue his work.</p><p>“... Hokuto?” Taiga called for him.</p><p>“Mhm?...”</p><p>“Can you get me a cup of ice?”</p><p>“Taiga… I’m trying to get some work done… Can’t you get it yourself?”</p><p>“... Please?...”</p><p>Hokuto sighed.</p><p>He guessed a small break wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>He stood up from his seat and went the kitchen, enjoying the momentary chill of the freezer as he filled a glass cup the brim with only ice cubes before sluggishly returning to his room where Taiga remained laid out on his bed.</p><p>When Hokuto tapped the cup to Taiga's neck, the other flinched as the cold glass sent a shiver down his spine.</p><p>“Here you go.”</p><p>Hokuto looked down at Taiga, his tank top barely hiding the pink buds in his chest as he smiled up at him, giving him a thank you before taking the cup from his hand.</p><p>Hokuto had to tear his eyes away from his boyfriend's body, intending to return to his work, but cool damp fingers wrapped around his wrist, pulling him back.</p><p>“Hokuto. Come here.”</p><p>When he turned back, Taiga was beckoning him closer with a wave of his finger to which Hokuto complied, leaning over him just as Taiga asked.</p><p>Even like this, Hokuto found his breath and heart being stolen by Taiga. The sun glistened off his skin while his blonde hair still glowed even when streaked with perspiration, showing the dark roots under the light color.</p><p>Hokuto didn't need to see his exposed legs or his waist to desire him. Taiga's beauty by itself was enough.</p><p>He lost himself in the curling of Taiga's lips, not noticing how Taiga's fingers fished for a cube in his cup to touch it against his lips. Even then, Hokuto didn't break his gaze as the ice chilled his lips and slowly wet them as it began to melt before the way Taiga parted his lips compelled him to do the same, allowing Taiga to slip the ice past his teeth and into his mouth.</p><p>The ice was cold against his tongue as Hokuto accepted it, his blood rushing as he watched the way Taiga's tongue flick temptingly over his lips, his eyes following the droplets from the ice roll down his fingers as they lingered on Hokuto's bottom lip, traveling down his wrist and along his arm.</p><p>And when Taiga licked up the drop from his skin with a playful smile, Hokuto's heart was set on fire as Taiga gripped his shirt to pull him down.</p><p>He didn't need persuasion to follow Taiga's lead onto his bed. He set Taiga's head between his elbows as he leaned in for Taiga to lick at his lips, asking for them to part as Hokuto held the ice behind his teeth, letting the cool water drip from his bottom lip.</p><p>Hokuto could feel how Taiga's fingers spread the beads of sweat that began to form on the back of his neck as Taiga ran his tongue over his lip, collecting the droplets to drink from him as it cooled his mouth as it made its way down his throat.</p><p>Hokuto wanted to be upset, knowing that Taiga was purposely distracting him from his work.</p><p>But it was so hot.</p><p>In both ways.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fuck studying.</p><p>Hokuto gave into his desires, letting himself do as he wanted to hours ago, sliding his hand under the strap of Taiga's shirt, palming and gliding over his chest to push the fabric off his shoulder as Taiga gave a pleased hum before opening his mouth in response to Hokuto's kiss.</p><p>The ice melted between their tongues as Hokuto released it from his teeth, feeling Taiga's chilled breath against his lips as he sighed happily into their kiss before Hokuto pulled away, seeing how the ice that was once in his own now gliding and swirling around Taiga's tongue, clattering against his teeth before he crunched down on what was left.</p><p>Hokuto wanted so badly to drink what was left from his lips.</p><p>"Taiga… I'm going to die of heat stroke if you keep doing this…"</p><p>Taiga laughed as he tugged at the back of Hokuto's shirt, pulling the dampening fabric off his body and tossing it on the floor.</p><p>He took another cube from the glass after setting it beside the bed and held it up to Hokuto's lips where he held Taiga's wrist to place the ice in his mouth himself. Taiga smiled as he let his fingers slide inside to press them against Hokuto's tongue and trace them over his canines that had bit into his skin many times before.</p><p>"That's why we have the ice."</p><p>Hokuto was nearly dizzied by his building lust.</p><p>God.</p><p>Taiga was worse than any heat.</p><p>Hokuto pinned the thin wrist above Taiga's head, the other shuddering in excitement from the sudden force as Hokuto leaned back down to feed the cold ice into Taiga's mouth.</p><p>Hokuto spread Taiga's legs with his knees, Taiga shifting them willingly as he dragged his foot up along Hokuto's calf with their shared breath turned white against the ice between their lips. Taiga's skin was soft and smooth as Hokuto dragged his hands up under his thighs, slipping his fingers under the much too short shorts Taiga wore and pushing them up on his hips to curve his grip around his ass</p><p>The chuckle in Taiga's throat melted into a moan as he felt Hokuto's fingers slide between rear cheeks and massage over his entrance. It twitched as Hokuto pushed at the relaxed muscle with the pad of his finger, remembering just how much he had stretched it open the night before.</p><p>Taiga caught Hokuto's face with his free hand as soft smooth sighs left his lips, the ice now gone from their heated breaths to leave them only with their kiss. The chill still lingered on their tongues as they filled themselves with each other without disruptions until Taiga gasped, breaking from the kiss when Hokuto began to push his finger in.</p><p>"Wait… Hokuto… " he breathed against Hokuto's lips as Hokuto resisted the tempting heat.</p><p>"I want to use my mouth."</p><p>Taiga was breathtakingly beautiful in every way.</p><p>Even when he rolled him over to sit on chest, only showing him the curve of his back as he straddled Hokuto's chest. His skin glistened in the setting colors of the sun with his top slipping from his shoulder and his shorts still riding high on his legs.</p><p>Hokuto could never get over Taiga's shape. Everything about it was captivating. It was better than any curve on a woman's body, no matter how voluptuous or petite.</p><p>Simply the fact that it belonged to Taiga was enough to turn him on.</p><p>Hokuto's blood rushed when he heard the unbuckling of his belt and the sound of his zipper being undone. Even as the thin fingers slid down his hips to push down the fabric that constrained his throbbing cock, he almost had to bite back a deep groan in his throat until he let out a sharp breath when the pressure was released, his member springing free.</p><p>"Wow. You're already this hard?" He heard Taiga say in front of him.</p><p>He set his hands on Taiga's hips as he watched Taiga's shoulder blades roll in his back as he leaned down.</p><p>"You're the one who made it this way..."</p><p>Hokuto's head was too busy swimming in anticipation to notice Taiga slip his fingers into his glass again.</p><p>He set his head back in his pillow, closing his eyes and biting at the inside of his lip as Taiga took him into his hand, but the groan that was forced from his chest got cut as a freezing touch was pressed against his member, sending a shock through his body.</p><p>"T-Taiga-"</p><p>Hokuto let out another groan as Taiga glided the ice down his shaft, enamored with just how quickly it melted against the heated skin. He smiled, enjoying the feeling of Hokuto's chest heave from underneath him as he rolled the ice over the tip and watched the water drip down his throbbing heat.</p><p>As if simply drinking from a fountain, Taiga tucked his blonde strands behind his ear before he laid his chest down onto Hokuto, lowering his head to kiss the base of his cock and lick up the droplets that the ice had left behind.</p><p>Hokuto rolled his head back, breathing hard through his nose as his fingers dug into Taiga's bundled shorts.</p><p>The chill of the ice mixed with the heat from Taiga's lips nearly made Hokuto go crazy. The ice cooled his skin, making it almost numb from his freezing touch before Taiga's hot tongue trailed after it, searing over it.</p><p>He swore his vision nearly blurred when Taiga took him into his mouth with the ice still on his tongue.</p><p>Hokuto bit back another moan as he hissed through his teeth, his body still burning despite the ice with Taiga's heat soaking into his skin as he laid on top of him and diligently serviced him.</p><p>He was burning up as he felt Taiga rolling himself against his chest, desiring pressure himself as he slid Hokuto to the back of his throat.</p><p>Hokuto breathed hard as he palmed Taiga's ass and took a cube from the cup.</p><p>He couldn't let Taiga have all the fun.</p><p>Taiga's body jolted when the ice slid between his cheeks, the water dripping down and soaking into his underwear that Hokuto had tugged to the side with his thumb. He moaned over Hokuto's member as it moved down, pressing against his hole.</p><p>"H-Hokuto… Easy-'' Taiga panted as he kissed the base of Hokuto's cock, letting it press against his cheek as he worshiped it.</p><p>Hokuto listened, smoothly rocking it over Taiga's sore entrance as Taiga hummed against Hokuto's shaft, licking and pumping the thick member in an even rhythm.</p><p>Hokuto couldn't look away.</p><p>His eyes stayed trained on the ice as he massaged it over the puckered hole, watching how it pushed against the abused muscle as the clear ice gave a fractured view of its pink color. The ice dripped as it was rocked against it, Taiga rolling his hips every time it nearly eased inside.</p><p>Hokuto wanted to be inside him so badly.</p><p>The view only reminded him of how much they had done it the night before when he had Taiga shuddering under him as he took him, loving the way Taiga called his name and kissed him as he came.</p><p>But now he had a full view of how Taiga's body had accepted him, adjusting to his size to take him inside him. How ready it was to take him again.</p><p>He resisted the urge to buck his hips as Taiga took him into his mouth and when he reached the back of Taiga's throat, he nearly lost his mind.</p><p>He pushed his thumb against the cube, making it stretch the muscle further and drawing a moan from Taiga's throat from the sensation, his voice vibrating against Hokuto's cock.</p><p>Hokuto could feel himself nearing his peak.</p><p>"Taiga- I'm-"</p><p>He should have known that saying anything encouraged Taiga.</p><p>It always did.</p><p>He rolled his head back as Taiga increased his pace, swallowing him each time.</p><p>His mind went blank as he came.</p><p>Hokuto's fingers pushed hard, making Taiga's body flex and curve as he groaned against him, his mouth filling with the hot fluid. Taiga swallowed as much as he could before drawing back, the rest of it spilling against his lips.</p><p>The ice melted in Hokuto's grip as his head was filled with a haze, still feeling Taiga's tongue along his twitching length, licking and cleaning every last drop as he came down from his high.</p><p>In his brief moment of clarity, Hokuto realized how his body was slick with sweat and his hair was damp from the heat as Taiga moved off of him, but as soon as he saw Taiga push his bottoms and underwear off his hips to be left abandoned on the floor, his mind was dragged back.</p><p>And when Taiga climbed back over him to straddle his waist, rubbing his entrance along his shaft, Hokuto was almost completely reinvigorated.</p><p>"We're not done yet," Taiga breathed as plucked another cube from the cup to drag down Hokuto's broad chest.</p><p>Taiga's blonde hair was messy and streaked with his sweat as strands slipped and fell over his lust filled gaze. As he settled the ice against Hokuto's belly button, the strap of his top hung off his shoulder, the thin fabric clinging to his glimmering skin as water pooled in the ripples of Hokuto's muscles.</p><p>"I haven't cum yet."</p><p>Hokuto was nearly aching with how badly he wanted to be buried inside him, but the way that Taiga took pleasure from his body made him feel drunk. His head felt heavy each time Taiga rut himself against him, his hot entrance gliding against his hardening length. He slowly lost his mind as his hips bucked by themselves when Taiga moaned his name, his hands gripping hard against Taiga's thighs as they flexed and righted under his hold.</p><p>"Hokuto… kiss."</p><p>Hokuto opened his glazed eyes as Taiga leaned over him, asking for his lips which Hokuto didn't hesitate to give. He kissed him before Taiga parted his lips, impatiently waiting for Hokuto to taste him. Hokuto pulled him down by his shirt, stretching and exposing Taiga's skin as he licked and swirled his tongue against Taiga's.</p><p>As they kissed, Hokuto felt the ice Taiga trailed over his stomach move down and when Taiga gripped their cocks together with the ice cube pressed along them, Hokuto's fingers dug into Taiga's thighs as he gasped.</p><p>Usually, Hokuto liked to help him, wrapping his hand around Taiga's to aid the rhythm, but this time Hokuto could tell that this was different.</p><p>Taiga was seeking release from Hokuto's body for himself. Hokuto was just the tool. His pleasure was just a byproduct of Taiga's needs, but it was not the goal.</p><p>Right now, it was all about him.</p><p>Taiga groaned as his hand quicked, his body curving and shuddering as he grew closer to his peak. Hokuto muted Taiga's sounds with his lips as he pressed his jaw hard into his, each moan rumbling in Taiga's throat.</p><p>Another stroke and another buck of his hips and Taiga came. He gasped sharply as he broke the kiss, burying his face into Hokuto's neck as his body jerked and spilled over Hokuto's stomach. Taiga gripped himself hard as the last pulses of his release throbbed through his body and the ice melted away, filling himself with the scent of Hokuto's sweat before dropping his weight onto Hokuto's chest.</p><p>It was burning hot.</p><p>Both of them were slick with sweat as their temperatures rose together. The small fan gave no relief with their bodies pressed together, their skin heated by each other's touch and raising pulse.</p><p>"Taiga…" Hokuto nearly panted into Taiga's damp hair, with his head boiling in the heat as his hands moved up Taiga's legs to his rear.</p><p>He pressed his fingers into the puckered hole that tightened around him as Taiga let out an airy gasp against his neck.</p><p>"Can I put it in?..."</p><p>Taiga pushed back, sitting himself back onto Hokuto's hips as Hokuto's hands slipped away from his ass to once again settle on his hips.</p><p>Just the sight of Hokuto gleaming in what was left of the sunlight with his abs covered with his release, eyes begging for him to let him inside made Taiga hard again.</p><p>Taiga bit his lip as he sat up on his knees to remove Hokuto from the rest of his clothes.</p><p>"Do you have to ask?"</p><p>Taiga threw aside the bottoms before reaching into Hokuto's drawer to push away the packs of condoms to grab the well used bottle of lube. Hokuto swallowed hard as he watched Taiga pour the fluid over his fingers before it was followed by the filthy sounds of Taiga using his fingers to coat himself well with the slick liquid, now knowing that Taiga wanted him raw.</p><p>The thought of feeling Taiga bare made his head spin just enough to not notice Taiga grab the once ice filled up to pour its contents over his length and hips.</p><p>Hokuto flinched and clenched his jaw as the chilled water spilled over him, cooling his skin before soaking into his sheets. The cold feeling only lasted for a moment before Taiga set himself over him, holding Hokuto's tip at his hole and slowly lowering himself down onto him.</p><p>Hokuto threw his head back as he choked back the moan that tried to tear out of his throat.</p><p>Taiga was searing hot.</p><p>After his length had been tortured and teased by the water and ice, Taiga's insides burned against him.</p><p>It felt like he was melting.</p><p>And it felt so <em>fucking</em> good.</p><p>If Taiga hadn't had his hips pinned down with his hands, Hokuto would have rammed the rest of himself deep inside Taiga, but he submitted to his will as Taiga slowly took all of him, his body once again accepting the length that had abused it over and over before.</p><p>Taiga gasped out a shaky breath as Hokuto's whole length reached deep inside him. He gave himself a moment for the pain to fade before he started to rock his hips, easing Hokuto in and out.</p><p>Typically Taiga liked it rough, teasing and edging Hokuto to go harder to make him moan as Hokuto pounded into him before he came screaming into the bed.</p><p>But all Taiga wanted right now was to feel him to lose himself in Hokuto's heat.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as he continued to roll his hips, unable to keep himself from snapping them every so often to bury Hokuto just that much deeper to hear his partner groan from under him as he squeezed around him. He moaned through his nose when Hokuto took his waist to grind himself deeper with each rock of his hips as he slowly succumbed to the pleasure. His body melted into the ecstasy as he breathed out a soft whimper each time Hokuto pushed back inside him.</p><p>"Taiga… you feel amazing…"</p><p>Taiga was an absolute vision as he worked himself on Hokuto's cock. His hair hung over his face as he steadied himself with his hands on Hokuto's torso. His body beautifully rolled before ending with the rocking of his hips, moving Hokuto in and out of him each time. Hokuto moved his hands with his hips as he watched the sweat roll down Taiga's body, trailing down his neck and over his collarbone to curve around the pink buds on his chest.</p><p>And when Taiga's eyes opened to meet his, Hokuto's body lit on fire.</p><p>His eyes were blurred with lust and wanting and Hokuto's were no doubt the same. Taiga's mind was filled with only him and for him to give him pleasure as he stilled his hips to feel Hokuto throb deep inside him.</p><p>Hokuto watched his eyes as he slid his hand up Taiga's body and under his shirt, his fingers following the lines of sweat before pushing his thumb over his nipple that quickly hardened under his touch. He saw how Taiga's eyes lost focus as his body lurched and tightened around his cock before jerking his hips again to push Hokuto deeper inside.</p><p>"H-Hokuto…"</p><p>Taiga's voice shook as his name left his lips, the moan that followed peaking when Hokuto pinched the buds on his chest.</p><p>"It- aahh… feels so …. nngh- haahhh…"</p><p>When Hokuto pressed his thumb against Taiga's lips, he graciously accepted it, sucking and rolled it in his mouth amongst his airy moans. Taiga's tongue was hot and wet, swirling around the digit and letting it push down on his tongue with the lingering taste of sweat. All the while Taiga continued to work his hips.</p><p>The vibrations on his thumb from Taiga's voice only turned on Hokuto more.</p><p>Taiga groaned as Hokuto dragged his wet thumb down Taiga's chin and along his throat.</p><p>"Hoku-to-… m-more-"</p><p>Taiga began picking up his hips to drop himself hard onto Hokuto's length, making Hokuto curse as he gripped into Taiga's rear to encourage his quickened pace.</p><p>Taiga's breath was paced with his movements, exhaling sharply every time Hokuto pushed deep inside him and gasping every time he lifted his hips, pulling Hokuto's length slowly out of himself, mixing with the soft moans and whimpers that escaped from his lips.</p><p>Even as the sun began to dip under the horizon, it was still blazing hot. Hokuto could feel his sweat fall from his hairline as he watched Taiga fuck himself with his cock. Taiga was no exception either. Sweat layered his pale skin as continued to lift and drop himself onto Hokuto's length with a wet slapping of skin.</p><p>The sweat rolled down his temple, traveling along his chin and throat before being caught along his collar bone, completely hypnotizing Hokuto as he watched it leave shining trails on Taiga's skin.</p><p>No matter how many times they did it, Hokuto never grew tired of Taiga's body. Every time, it made Hokuto hunger for him more the next and every time it felt like heaven.</p><p>Not to mention that Taiga was good at sex.</p><p>He was so fucking good at sex…</p><p>"Taiga…"</p><p>Taiga didn't stop his hips as he opened his hazed eyes and wet his dry lips with his tongue when Hokuto growled his name.</p><p>He smiled when Hokuto sat up, pulling Taiga into his lap as Taiga immediately threw his arms around his neck, grinding his hips into his.</p><p>"What is it?" Taiga panted into Hokuto's ear with a pleased sigh as Hokuto sank Taiga's hips down on his length. "Did you get tired of watching?"</p><p>Taiga chuckled as Hokuto licked up his neck before nipping at his jaw and sucking on the skin under his ear.</p><p>"I will never get tired of watching you."</p><p>Hokuto could taste the salt on his skin as he licked up the trails of sweat on his neck, burying his nose in his damp hair.</p><p>Taiga's scent was overwhelming. Hokuto had always loved the smell of his skin, but with the heat his scent became strong enough for Hokuto to feel as if he could get drunk on it.</p><p>He continued to attack Taiga's skin with his lips and teeth as Taiga's sweet smell filled his senses, leaving dark bruises before moving and starting another.</p><p>Taiga let out a heated breath, burying his fingers in Hokuto's hair and letting him drink from his skin. His hips rocked slowly, mixing the pleasure of being stretched with the wonderful feeling of Hokuto hungrily claiming his skin.</p><p>"Hokuto…" Taiga breathed into Hokuto's hair.</p><p>"Kiss me."</p><p>It didn't take more than a moment for Hokuto to pull back and take Taiga's lips.</p><p>Taiga smiled as he opened his mouth, letting Hokuto lick at the roof of his mouth while he dragged his fingers back into Hokuto's hair, laying it back with the streaks of his sweat. They clutched to the back of Hokuto's neck as Hokuto began to move Taiga's hips up and down his length.</p><p>Taiga moved with Hokuto's grip, rutting his hips as he gasped into Hokuto's lips, closing his eyes and giving himself to the pleasure.</p><p>Their skin was slick as the sun beat down on them from the open window. Their sweat blended as Taiga kept their bodies together, clinging around Hokuto's neck, throwing his chin over his shoulder and dragging his hands over the beads of sweat on Hokuto's back. He moaned in his throat, leaning his cheek along Hokuto's shoulder as his hips continued their rhythm.</p><p>Hokuto bit into the curve of Taiga's shoulder, receiving a whimper, digging his fangs into his sweet skin.</p><p>The temperature was sweltering with Taiga's heated body stuck close and wrapped around him. His head was on fire and deep haze, sweat rolling from his temple as his body gave into the heat.</p><p>His fingers gripped Taiga's rear, filling his hands with the soft flesh, making Taiga flinch before smiling and nipping at the shell of Hokuto's ear.</p><p>"Feel good?..." Taiga breathed.</p><p>"... So good..."</p><p>Hokuto pushed Taiga down, a tempting smile on Taiga's lips as his back felt flat on the sheets at the end of Hokuto's small bed. He played with the stray strand of hair that fell over Hokuto's glazed eyes as he hooked Taiga's knees over his arms, taking one to his shoulder and lips. Taiga tucked the sweat stained strand behind Hokuto's ear as he turned his head to kiss and mark the pale skin around Taiga's knee and calf.</p><p>Taiga swallowed hard in anticipation as Hokuto stared him down from the corner of his eyes, dragging his tongue up Taiga's leg before nipping at bone in his ankle. He spoke into his skin, his hot breath sending a wave of heat through Taiga's body.</p><p>"So fucking good…"</p><p>Taiga felt his heart set ablaze as he bit into the inside of his cheek and dug his nails into Hokuto's thigh.</p><p>Taiga always took exactly what he wanted, never feeling the need for Hokuto to advance intimacy with him first. But he was always excited for the moment Hokuto's switch was flipped. When Hokuto was the one eager to take.</p><p>Taiga's head flung back, hanging over the end of the bed as a moan rang from his throat as Hokuto snapped himself deep inside him, his body sparking with pleasure.</p><p>"Hoku–to-!"</p><p>Hokuto held onto Taiga's thighs, holding him steady as he pounded into him, forcing Taiga's moans of pleasure to spill from his lips with each thrust. He took and took, ramming, grinding himself deep inside his lover's body.</p><p>It was so fucking hot.</p><p>Their bodies were both glazed with sweat as their muscles flexed and released with their sex, but neither could stop as their heads boiled, wanting nothing more than the other's heat.</p><p>"Hard–er!" Taiga groaned, his words hitching through them. "M-more-aah-! Hnnh-!! Haah-!!"</p><p>Taiga yelped as Hokuto suddenly pulled him down the bed. He chuckled and threw his arms around Hokuto's neck as Hokuto licked and sucked on his skin, collecting Taiga in his arms to hold him down as he thrusted hard and deep inside, making Taiga's laughter roll into panting moans.</p><p>It felt like he was losing his mind. Taiga's body was scorching as Hokuto wrapped himself around him, the heat of his tensing muscles seeping into him as his hot cock pounded into him, lighting his insides ablaze. He clawed his fingers into Hokuto's back, his head drowning in the heat as the sweat collected under his nails, moaning with his breath hitching with every thrust.</p><p>"M-mo-re!!"</p><p>"R-right th-ere!!"</p><p>Taiga buried his face into Hokuto's dampened hair, gasping into his skin and groaning as he was drowned in his heat and his scent, each thrust building on the blaze in his stomach.</p><p>From the way Taiga clung tight to him and how he bit back his moans as they heightened in his throat, Hokuto could tell Taiga was near his peak. He had watched it enough times when Taiga had his way with him whether it was when he was on his lap or thrusting himself down onto him on hands and knees.</p><p>Either way, it always tindered the fire in Hokuto's heart, wanting nothing more than to bring Taiga to his release.</p><p>He could feel Taiga tighten around him when he whispered into his ear before adding more dark bruises to the collection on the column of Taiga's neck.</p><p>"Come."</p><p>"Come for me-"</p><p>With the way Hokuto pinned down his hips to slam every last inch of himself inside him, it wasn't hard for Taiga to comply.</p><p>Just the sound of Hokuto's deep voice in his ear fueled the flame in his stomach as Taiga gave himself to the pleasure, his mind melting from Hokuto's heat penetrating deep inside him.</p><p>"H-Hokuto–!!"</p><p>Hokuto lived for the moments when Taiga's cool composure melted away to leave only a man to sought release, and when Taiga's fingers dug deep into his hair to pull him to his lips, panting deep drawn out moans into his mouth, he knew he was there.</p><p>Just a bit more and Taiga would come undone, but Hokuto wanted it to last just a moment longer.</p><p>"Taiga…"</p><p>He panted his name into his lips as stars formed in the corners of Taiga's eyes from Hokuto snapping his hips hard into him at a slow even pace.</p><p>"Taiga-!"</p><p>"Hokuto!!"</p><p>Taiga's body rolled with Hokuto's as he hit deep inside him again, their sweat sliding between their hips and skin as Hokuto began to pump Taiga's length with his thrusts.</p><p>Taiga was drowning in pleasure as his body lit up from inside and out, his nails clawing into Hokuto's scalp and neck as he drank the saliva from Hokuto's tongue against his.</p><p>His body was already shuddering before his climax between each thrust as Hokuto rounded his thumb over his aching and weeping tip.</p><p>Finally, a hard hit against that spot inside him made his back curl and flex as he lips tore away from Hokuto's, a gasp strangled in his throat as fire flashed through his body.</p><p>Hokuto sank his teeth into Taiga's neck as his tightening muscles nearly made him go dizzy.</p><p>Another. And another. And another, Taiga's moan dragging and hitching with each until he choked as came, his hips rolling involuntarily as he writhed and spilled over his chest.</p><p>He was only given a half second to bathe in his climax before Hokuto quickened his thrusts again, making Taiga's body jolt and convulse from its heightened sensitivity as Hokuto sought his own release.</p><p>"H-Hok-kut–o!!"</p><p>Hokuto pulled back, eyes hazy with lust as his mouth nearly watered from the mess below him, tugging at Taiga's hips before pinning them down onto his cock as he came.</p><p>Taiga bit down on his bottom lip, toes curling as he felt Hokuto pump himself deep inside him, the hot fluid lighting his stomach on fire, each pulse pouring more until he was overflowing.</p><p>The semen leaked past Hokuto's cock until he pulled out, letting it seap and flow down from Taiga's abused entrance before staining the sweat soaked bed below him.</p><p>Both of their chests heaved as Hokuto laid beside his boyfriend, his high fading as he slowly realized just how hot it was.</p><p>God. It was hot.</p><p>During sex, he paid no mind to the blanket of perspiration that layered over his skin, but as clarity came to him, he noticed just how sticky it felt in the humid summer air.</p><p>Maybe he would take a cold shower.</p><p>He breathed.</p><p>"Taiga…"</p><p>"Wait- Taiga–"</p><p>Hokuto was about to check on his other beside him, but even before he opened his eyes, Taiga was climbing over him, straddling his hips once again.</p><p>The tank top over Taiga's body was nearly transparent as it was soaked through, somehow draped perfectly over Taiga's pretty pink cock as Hokuto's release rolled down his thighs.</p><p>Taiga chuckled when he felt Hokuto's length twitch under his palm when he laid his hand over the skin that became just a bit too easily hard with blood again.</p><p>"I'm not done with you."</p><p>Hokuto swallowed hard as Taiga placed the tip of his boyfriend's cock at his slick and stretched hole.</p><p>"More."</p><h6></h6><p>Hokuto felt like he was going crazy.</p><p>Even long after the sun had set, it was unbelievably hot.</p><p>Taiga leaned himself against the window sill, his forehead bumping against the glass door they had to shut to keep his neighbors from complaining about their persistent sex.</p><p>Hokuto tugged at the abused top over Taiga's shoulders, the fabric balled in his fist as he kept Taiga's body in place as he kept an easy smooth pace that was fitting for their multiple rounds.</p><p>Taiga's smooth back was now completely covered in hickeys, bites and bruises that trailed along his hips, along the curve of his ass and between his thighs.</p><p>They had almost done it until midnight, but somehow neither of them had had quite enough.</p><p>"Hokuto– I'm almost–"</p><p>Taiga moaned and sighed against the wooden sill as he reached back looking for Hokuto's hand.</p><p>Hokuto took it, threading his fingers between his as he leaned over him, wrapping his other arm around Taiga's chest to flick and rub over his nipple that was surrounded with darkening bruises.</p><p>Taiga gasped, his knees nearly giving out from under him as he came again, but not before pushing his hips back into Hokuto to ensure that he came inside him.</p><p>Hokuto bucked into Taiga as he steadied himself against the sill, filling back up what had spilled out over Hokuto's cock pushing back into him.</p><p>Taiga collapsed first, laying out on the mess of a bed before Hokuto rolled him over and wrapped him tightly in his arms.</p><p>"Hokuto-..." Taiga panted into Hokuto's ear, his energy drained as he hugged Hokuto's shoulders.</p><p>"It's hot…"</p><p>"Please turn on the AC…"</p><p>Hokuto could only hum as he reached out blindly over to his bedside table, his nails tapping against the long emptied glass before finally feeling the edge of the remote.</p><p>The moment the cool air poured from the unit above, Hokuto felt like he was a whole different person as clarity came with the fading heat.</p><p>He propped himself on his elbows, Taiga still under him as he kissed the messy blonde hair of the other.</p><p>"Are you okay?..." he breathed softly, Taiga lazily hooking his hands behind his neck.</p><p>"Do you think I'm okay?" Taiga chuckled, curling the ends of Hokuto's hair around his finger.</p><p>"My boyfriend just fucked me for hours, what do you think?"</p><p>Even after hours of endless passion, somehow Hokuto still found himself falling victim to Taiga's charm as Taiga smiled and cupped his cheek.</p><p>He nuzzled into his neck, Taiga chuckling as Hokuto pressed light loving kisses into the bruised and bitten skin, adoring how each was made by him.</p><p>Taiga nudged at his chin, asking for Hokuto's lips to which he complied, each kiss sweet and gentle, smiling as their bodies finally cooled from the sweltering humid heat.</p><p>"Mmn… Hokuto?" Taiga whispered into their kiss.</p><p>"Mhm?" Hokuto replied as Taiga pressed his lips on the edge of his chin.</p><p>"Can you bring me to the bath?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Hokuto accepted the pecks Taiga gave as thanks before sitting back and stepping off the bed.</p><p>Taiga held his arms up like a child waiting for a carry before Hokuto scooped him into his arms to bring both of them into his small apartment shower.</p><p>Taiga tucked a loose strand of hair behind Hokuto's ear as the bathroom door came open.</p><p>"Were you still planning on studying?"</p><p>Hokuto let out the low chuckle that made Taiga's heart skip each time.</p><p>"There's no way in hell I'm studying anymore."</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga let out a relaxed sigh when the cool conditioned air washed over him as he opened the door to Jesse's apartment, alerting Shintaro of his arrival.</p><p>"Kyomo! You're late!"</p><p>"Sorry sorry," Taiga smiled as he toed off his sandals. "I forgot I was leaving from Hokuto's house."</p><p>"Your boy toy is always your excuse," Shintaro sighed as Taiga entered the living room, still basking in the tempered air after climbing up the stairs in the evening heat to the unit.</p><p>"He's my excuse because he's the reason every time."</p><p>"Taiga! What do you want to drink?" Jesse asked from the kitchen, leaning over to speak through the doorway as he finished setting the soumen on a tray. "Beer? Chu-hi?"</p><p>"Beer sounds great, thank you!"</p><p>Taiga took the bottle of beer Jesse held out through the door and handed it to Shintaro to open as Jesse soon followed, placing their dinner on the small low table.</p><p>"I'm surprised you have your AC on full blast," Taiga said, unzipping his hoodie as he sat down on the cushion on the floor.</p><p>Jesse shrugged a little as he handed out chopsticks after waiting for Shintaro to finish popping the cap off of Taiga's bottle. "I sweat easily. So I keep it cool in here, even if I have to skip some meals."</p><p>"Well, the summers are getting hotter and hotter," Shintaro mumbled as he sipped from his can that was already half empty. "But can I say something?"</p><p>"Hmm?" Taiga hummed as he took his chopsticks.</p><p>"Aren't you being just a little too bold??"</p><p>Taiga blinked at the finger Shintaro pointed at him.</p><p>He played ignorant, but without even asking, Taiga already knew exactly what Shintaro meant.</p><p>"Oh. This?"</p><p>Jesse had to look down into his bowl as Taiga pulled at the collar of his oversized shirt to save his cheeks from coloring pink.</p><p>The deep colored love bites had only darkened over time as Taiga shamelessly wore them like accessories on his skin. They were all over his neck, collar and shoulders from where Hokuto ran his tongue over his skin, drinking and tasting their sex.</p><p>Taiga just laughed, readjusting his shirt which was fruitlessly unable to cover the trails of marks up his neck.</p><p>"Oh come on, it's not that bad."</p><p>"Sometimes I just want to enjoy the heat."</p>
