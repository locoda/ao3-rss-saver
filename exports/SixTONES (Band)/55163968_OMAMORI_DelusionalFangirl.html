</p><p>Tsuyu is just beginning. Is a new beginning for him too. The first time he went out in ages. Although, everything in his room is nostalgic now. Ten years have passed, without taking a walk without all the garments. He looked in the mirror and saw his face without his makeup, and his new short hair.</p><p>He thought maybe visiting the mountain jinja to ask for an Omamori from Benzaiten for a lucky new era in his life.</p><p>Walking across the kagemajaya through the empty corridors to the front harimise.</p><p>It's done, Otosan would do a deal to merge his tea house. The guy that will be in charge is a good manager, and a good entertainer, even though he felt sad for not being enough to take care of it.</p><p>He walked several kilometers from the Yoyaku until get into the Jinja; he is well known for the monks there. He would say the principal priest has a little mercy for him and let him stay.</p><p>Walking back by sumida river trying to collect the goshuin, he saw the Ajisai in full bloom with the beautiful blue decorating the path.</p><p>He took the advice of the priest, and this time he'll ask a special Omamori of Ebisu for the good luck of the merge. The rain started pouring again, and made it more difficult to walk in zori with his silk hakama.</p><p>At least it felt at peace, praying and meditating in the forest made him exhale his worries and let them out.</p><p>He got both, one red omamori for arts fortune and a purple one for business fortune. And the main priest at Benzaiten shrine gave him a special pink one: for love.</p><p>In the middle of the rain, returning without an umbrella or Sugegasa to protect his head, he tried to hurry home. Of course, typical of his smug gait, he lost his balance and wobbled as he walked trying to grab hold of the tree branches along the way to prevent a big fall.</p><p>He sighed, his palms were red but at least he didn't fall off. Trying to re-arrange his hakama and kimono, saw his sleeves were empty and the omamori fell off.</p><p>He tried to collect them: but he couldn't see the pink one.It was special, the priest made it thinking of him, he can't leave it abandoned.</p><p>Looking everywhere, desperate at last luckily he saw it at a river ravine. He took off his zori and only in his white silk tabi tried to walk down to the river for his precious omamori.</p><p>But, everything was in vain, he slid off because of the muddy floor.</p><p>Centimeters before the catastrophe he felt a grip on his sleeve and then in his arm.</p><p>Silly him, he still tried to reach the lucky charm from being washed away by the rush of the river</p><p>"I must save it! I'm too close" he said without looking back.<br/>
Instead of letting it go, the grip got stronger and made it easier to kneel and reach his amulet from the muddy riverside.</p><p>"Got it" exclaimed joyfully. And thus he was pulled back to a safe place.</p><p>Now, he faces his savior for the first time, a boy almost his age.</p><p>"Shukun sama, I'm sorry for your robes" the boy bowed deeply.</p><p>He looked his dougi was a little loose, and his hakama ending a bit muddy. But, the most interesting thing was the boy calling him "lord". He quickly thought and rather than correct the boy, he rode the current.</p><p>"It's nothing wrong. If it weren't for you I could have fallen to the river, may I ask your name mr. savior?</p><p>"Tanaka" said bowing.</p><p>He didn't understand what he meant.</p><p>"We are the fisher clan of Edo, the biggest and kindest" said the boy with a bit of pride in his tone.</p><p>"I see. Tanaka. It Would be very difficult to call you if the clan is so big. Tell me your name"</p><p>"Yah" the boy messed up his hair "Just don't laugh, my name is Juri. I don't know what they were thinking of naming me that way. I suppose they wanted to be original"</p><p>"Do you know how kanji Juri is written?"</p><p>"Sorry Lord, I don't know. I don't know to write"</p><p>"Doesn't matter. You save me. I think it should be something calm like this forest, kanji represent your soul, right?"</p><p>Juri saw the palm of his hand reddish.</p><p>"My Lord, let me cure that. My mom have become an specialist of injuries with fishing nets"</p><p>He can't keep quiet and do nothing and keep this boy ignorant, in a lie.</p><p>"I'm not a Lord. I'm aâ€¦ I think it is better you call me by my name. My name is Taiga. Nice to meet you"</p><p>Both bowed at the same time.</p><p>"The clan is resting in an izakaya by the river. Of course you can eat the best fish here only provided by Tanaka"</p><p>Taiga laughed. A bit inside him feels calm, refreshing, not talking about the same things all the time. Work has eaten most of his life and now facing a new beginning, he feels like by fortune can interact so freely. He has nothing to lose, so he gives it a try.</p><p>Juri is interesting. So self confident, proud of his work. Something Taiga desperately looks like a new ikigai.</p><p>Juri is a talking machine. All the way to the tavern he went talking about how hideous this climate is for fishing.</p><p>"Shukun sama" various men raised from the floor and bowed deeply.</p><p>"I prefer Taiga"</p><p>Juri saw him a bit troubled and eased the situation.</p><p>"Mom, can you help? He has his hands scattered"</p><p>A chubby lady came from the back of the frontline mens. She took his hands and looked at his palms.</p><p>"Nothing that bad. I have something. His hands are so fragile, so soft! this isn't luckily a big injury".</p><p>Of course, Taiga hands are not fisherman's hands.</p><p>The ointment was fresh with a little lemon perfume. He felt the relief quickly not only in his skin but in his soul. Those who called themselves friends of his were too far or too busy to cheer him up. Although he only knows the clan for a couple of minutes he felt them as relatives, even more like home warmth he ever desired.<br/>
Tsuyu as always is unpredictable. The rain got worse, so Juri and his father, the head of the Tanaka Clan insisted on staying at least until the rain was enough to come back home.</p><p>Juri and his brothers sat at a table and made a place for Taiga.</p><p>"Are you from Edo?" Juri asked, sharing a cup of Sake.</p><p>"Yes, I born here actually"</p><p>"Oh" all the members in the same table exclaimed. But the last statement made all tanaka's thought it was right, he was a noble man.</p><p>Juri saw a slightly uncomfortable face from his guest. And showed one of his virtues: being a calm friend.</p><p>"Neither of us were born here. It depends of the fishing season"</p><p>One of them on his left punched Juri on his arm "what are you talking about? we both were born at the same house". All of them laughed at the brothers playing as the boke and tsukkomi.</p><p>Is something in just watching them chat that makes it unique: the family. Of course the older brother has honorifics and at the same time plays with the minor of them and gets scolded too. Taiga just smiled just to see them.</p><p>"Taiga, are you here? You're not saying a single word!" Juri exclaimed, padding his shoulder.</p><p>"I'm just enjoying the moment, it's so funny hearing you" Taiga scratched his head " I don't know what topic to talk about".</p><p>"How about matsuri?" Said the older Naru.</p><p>"Oh man! I missed last year's dochu!" Subaru the youngest interrupted before Taiga had the opportunity to talk. He earned a good slap on his nape from Juri, "Baka be polite with my guest"</p><p>"I like matsuri, especially fireworks. But I don't have anyone to go with this year"</p><p>"So it's decided now you can join the Tanaka's Clan" Hyoga said, with the same pride of the clan as Juri talked before.</p><p>"Do you think a noble will go out with a fisherman? We are already thankful is right here chatting with us" Koki retorted.</p><p>All of these made the chat uncomfortable again, a place he wants to escape.</p><p>"Let them be a bunch of idiots. They're lonely too. And you Naru, should take your kids to the matsuri" Juri leaned on Taiga's shoulder "Do you believe this guy got really drunk and left the kids with Tanaka uncles?" Said between laughs.</p><p>"Aoi Sama will be there this year too"</p><p>The youngest is still excited about the oiran parade.</p><p>"She is very talented and tender" , Taiga said out of nowhere.</p><p>"Do you really know Taiyu?" Koki raised an eyebrow</p><p>"Jun tan brings botchan without even told us, we had to use something better than this rags"</p><p>"I'm the best" Juri said laughing to his brother and made the whole table laugh with him. Taiga was fascinated how Juri can handle these situations, how his laugh is contagious, in short his whole personality. Not fake and cold tatemae but a good and kindhearted smile.<br/>
The whole evening was impressive jokes, laughs, impersonations, Taiga couldn't recall how much time they spent sitting at the table.</p><p>He also let himself be. With a little help of the sake let out his mixture of innocent and pervy jokes. He thought he might sound lame, but Tanaka's laugh loudly.</p><p>"Hey Juri, he can't be here forever. Let him back with his wife. Unlike you, he must be missed at home"<br/>
Taiga again got tense.<br/>
"Looser, stop telling everyone I'm not married yet '' Juri yelled and laughed.<br/>
Taiga doesn't know how to answer this. So he politely bowed.<br/>
"Thanks Tanaka house for having me here. I'm just leaving. With your permission" and bowed directly to the head of the clan, Juri's father.<br/>
He quickly walked and put his zori stepping outside the bar.<br/>
He wasn't hurt exactly, just everything came to an end. He has to get back and keep going with his life. Even more, he is grateful to the gods he had the opportunity to breathe a nice fresh air and made his heart flutter for a bit.</p><p>Juri, instead, feels disappointed.<br/>
"Stupids!What did you say to him to make him angry?"<br/>
And he tried to stand. A bit difficult with all the sake he has drunk.<br/>
Still, he tried to follow Taiga by the road.<br/>
Casually he found him a couple of meters from there heading the forest's path.</p><p>"I'm sorry for my brothers. I have no intentions to hurt you in anyway" he told Taiga as he was walking from behind.</p><p>Taiga turned to look at him with a smile, and Juri tried to bow deeply.<br/>
Taiga's hands stopped him. And reassured<br/>
"I had a great time with you and your family. But is fair that you have to rest"</p><p>"What about you my lord? Can I help you to take you home" said Juri pulling a kasa from his back.</p><p>"Oh no, it's better you stay here. I'll take the river path is faster and I know it well"</p><p>"Lord: Is it about your family? You live in the forest like that?" Pointing to the exquisite silk of Taiga's kimono.</p><p>"Stop it! I've already told you I'm not a lord"</p><p>Juri eyes got bigger and his jaws dropped</p><p>"A yokai!" Juri fell in seiza and put his head near the soil between his hands.<br/>
"Please, don't hurt my family. Take me to the forest if you want so, but they have families to take care of"</p><p>Taiga kneeled down in front of Juri.<br/>
"I'm 100% human. I swear it.<br/>
And the path along the river is safe and quick back home"</p><p>Juri looking directly to Taiga eyes asked<br/>
"If you are human, you dress too much like a daimyo relative. But also you said to me you aren't a lord. You steal a kimono from death or something?"</p><p>Finally, Juri stumped the elephant in the room.<br/>
"Is more complicated"<br/>
Juri stared at him in disbelief, raising an eyebrow.<br/>
"You indeed are a thiefâ€¦ a ronin or worst a killer"<br/>
"Please do not be afraid," Taiga said, putting his hands on top of Juri's shoulders.<br/>
"I'm a Kagema".</p>
