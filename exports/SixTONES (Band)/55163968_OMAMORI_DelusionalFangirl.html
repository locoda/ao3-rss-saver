</p><p>Tsuyu is just beginning. Is a new beginning for him too. The first time he went out in ages. Although, everything in his room is nostalgic now. Ten years have passed, without taking a walk without all the garments. He looked in the mirror and saw his face without his makeup, and his new short hair.</p><p>He thought maybe visiting the mountain jinja to ask for an Omamori from Benzaiten for a lucky new era in his life.</p><p>Walking across the kagemajaya through the empty corridors to the front harimise.</p><p>It's done, Otosan would do a deal to merge his tea house. The guy that will be in charge is a good manager, and a good entertainer, even though he felt sad for not being enough to take care of it.</p><p>He walked several kilometers from the Yoyaku until get into the Jinja; he is well known for the monks there. He would say the principal priest has a little mercy for him and let him stay.</p><p>Walking back by sumida river trying to collect the goshuin, he saw the Ajisai in full bloom with the beautiful blue decorating the path.</p><p>He took the advice of the priest, and this time he'll ask a special Omamori of Ebisu for the good luck of the merge. The rain started pouring again, and made it more difficult to walk in zori with his silk hakama.</p><p>At least it felt at peace, praying and meditating in the forest made him exhale his worries and let them out.</p><p>He got both, one red omamori for arts fortune and a purple one for business fortune. And the main priest at Benzaiten shrine gave him a special pink one: for love.</p><p>In the middle of the rain, returning without an umbrella or Sugegasa to protect his head, he tried to hurry home. Of course, typical of his smug gait, he lost his balance and wobbled as he walked trying to grab hold of the tree branches along the way to prevent a big fall.</p><p>He sighed, his palms were red but at least he didn't fall off. Trying to re-arrange his hakama and kimono, saw his sleeves were empty and the omamori fell off.</p><p>He tried to collect them: but he couldn't see the pink one.It was special, the priest made it thinking of him, he can't leave it abandoned.</p><p>Looking everywhere, desperate at last luckily he saw it at a river ravine. He took off his zori and only in his white silk tabi tried to walk down to the river for his precious omamori.</p><p>But, everything was in vain, he slid off because of the muddy floor.</p><p>Centimeters before the catastrophe he felt a grip on his sleeve and then in his arm.</p><p>Silly him, he still tried to reach the lucky charm from being washed away by the rush of the river</p><p>"I must save it! I'm too close" he said without looking back.<br/>
Instead of letting it go, the grip got stronger and made it easier to kneel and reach his amulet from the muddy riverside.</p><p>"Got it" exclaimed joyfully. And thus he was pulled back to a safe place.</p><p>Now, he faces his savior for the first time, a boy almost his age.</p><p>"Shukun sama, I'm sorry for your robes" the boy bowed deeply.</p><p>He looked his dougi was a little loose, and his hakama ending a bit muddy. But, the most interesting thing was the boy calling him "lord". He quickly thought and rather than correct the boy, he rode the current.</p><p>"It's nothing wrong. If it weren't for you I could have fallen to the river, may I ask your name mr. savior?</p><p>"Tanaka" said bowing.</p><p>He didn't understand what he meant.</p><p>"We are the fisher clan of Edo, the biggest and kindest" said the boy with a bit of pride in his tone.</p><p>"I see. Tanaka. It Would be very difficult to call you if the clan is so big. Tell me your name"</p><p>"Yah" the boy messed up his hair "Just don't laugh, my name is Juri. I don't know what they were thinking of naming me that way. I suppose they wanted to be original"</p><p>"Do you know how kanji Juri is written?"</p><p>"Sorry Lord, I don't know. I don't know to write"</p><p>"Doesn't matter. You save me. I think it should be something calm like this forest, kanji represent your soul, right?"</p><p>Juri saw the palm of his hand reddish.</p><p>"My Lord, let me cure that. My mom have become an specialist of injuries with fishing nets"</p><p>He can't keep quiet and do nothing and keep this boy ignorant, in a lie.</p><p>"I'm not a Lord. I'm a… I think it is better you call me by my name. My name is Taiga. Nice to meet you"</p><p>Both bowed at the same time.</p><p>"The clan is resting in an izakaya by the river. Of course you can eat the best fish here only provided by Tanaka"</p><p>Taiga laughed. A bit inside him feels calm, refreshing, not talking about the same things all the time. Work has eaten most of his life and now facing a new beginning, he feels like by fortune can interact so freely. He has nothing to lose, so he gives it a try.</p><p>Juri is interesting. So self confident, proud of his work. Something Taiga desperately looks like a new ikigai.</p><p>Juri is a talking machine. All the way to the tavern he went talking about how hideous this climate is for fishing.</p><p>"Shukun sama" various men raised from the floor and bowed deeply.</p><p>"I prefer Taiga"</p><p>Juri saw him a bit troubled and eased the situation.</p><p>"Mom, can you help? He has his hands scattered"</p><p>A chubby lady came from the back of the frontline mens. She took his hands and looked at his palms.</p><p>"Nothing that bad. I have something. His hands are so fragile, so soft! this isn't luckily a big injury".</p><p>Of course, Taiga hands are not fisherman's hands.</p><p>The ointment was fresh with a little lemon perfume. He felt the relief quickly not only in his skin but in his soul. Those who called themselves friends of his were too far or too busy to cheer him up. Although he only knows the clan for a couple of minutes he felt them as relatives, even more like home warmth he ever desired.<br/>
Tsuyu as always is unpredictable. The rain got worse, so Juri and his father, the head of the Tanaka Clan insisted on staying at least until the rain was enough to come back home.</p><p>Juri and his brothers sat at a table and made a place for Taiga.</p><p>"Are you from Edo?" Juri asked, sharing a cup of Sake.</p><p>"Yes, I born here actually"</p><p>"Oh" all the members in the same table exclaimed. But the last statement made all tanaka's thought it was right, he was a noble man.</p><p>Juri saw a slightly uncomfortable face from his guest. And showed one of his virtues: being a calm friend.</p><p>"Neither of us were born here. It depends of the fishing season"</p><p>One of them on his left punched Juri on his arm "what are you talking about? we both were born at the same house". All of them laughed at the brothers playing as the boke and tsukkomi.</p><p>Is something in just watching them chat that makes it unique: the family. Of course the older brother has honorifics and at the same time plays with the minor of them and gets scolded too. Taiga just smiled just to see them.</p><p>"Taiga, are you here? You're not saying a single word!" Juri exclaimed, padding his shoulder.</p><p>"I'm just enjoying the moment, it's so funny hearing you" Taiga scratched his head " I don't know what topic to talk about".</p><p>"How about matsuri?" Said the older Naru.</p><p>"Oh man! I missed last year's dochu!" Subaru the youngest interrupted before Taiga had the opportunity to talk. He earned a good slap on his nape from Juri, "Baka be polite with my guest"</p><p>"I like matsuri, especially fireworks. But I don't have anyone to go with this year"</p><p>"So it's decided now you can join the Tanaka's Clan" Hyoga said, with the same pride of the clan as Juri talked before.</p><p>"Do you think a noble will go out with a fisherman? We are already thankful is right here chatting with us" Koki retorted.</p><p>All of these made the chat uncomfortable again, a place he wants to escape.</p><p>"Let them be a bunch of idiots. They're lonely too. And you Naru, should take your kids to the matsuri" Juri leaned on Taiga's shoulder "Do you believe this guy got really drunk and left the kids with Tanaka uncles?" Said between laughs.</p><p>"Aoi Sama will be there this year too"</p><p>The youngest is still excited about the oiran parade.</p><p>"She is very talented and tender" , Taiga said out of nowhere.</p><p>"Do you really know Taiyu?" Koki raised an eyebrow</p><p>"Jun tan brings botchan without even told us, we had to use something better than this rags"</p><p>"I'm the best" Juri said laughing to his brother and made the whole table laugh with him. Taiga was fascinated how Juri can handle these situations, how his laugh is contagious, in short his whole personality. Not fake and cold tatemae but a good and kindhearted smile.<br/>
The whole evening was impressive jokes, laughs, impersonations, Taiga couldn't recall how much time they spent sitting at the table.</p><p>He also let himself be. With a little help of the sake let out his mixture of innocent and pervy jokes. He thought he might sound lame, but Tanaka's laugh loudly.</p><p>"Hey Juri, he can't be here forever. Let him back with his wife. Unlike you, he must be missed at home"<br/>
Taiga again got tense.<br/>
"Looser, stop telling everyone I'm not married yet '' Juri yelled and laughed.<br/>
Taiga doesn't know how to answer this. So he politely bowed.<br/>
"Thanks Tanaka house for having me here. I'm just leaving. With your permission" and bowed directly to the head of the clan, Juri's father.<br/>
He quickly walked and put his zori stepping outside the bar.<br/>
He wasn't hurt exactly, just everything came to an end. He has to get back and keep going with his life. Even more, he is grateful to the gods he had the opportunity to breathe a nice fresh air and made his heart flutter for a bit.</p><p>Juri, instead, feels disappointed.<br/>
"Stupids!What did you say to him to make him angry?"<br/>
And he tried to stand. A bit difficult with all the sake he has drunk.<br/>
Still, he tried to follow Taiga by the road.<br/>
Casually he found him a couple of meters from there heading the forest's path.</p><p>"I'm sorry for my brothers. I have no intentions to hurt you in anyway" he told Taiga as he was walking from behind.</p><p>Taiga turned to look at him with a smile, and Juri tried to bow deeply.<br/>
Taiga's hands stopped him. And reassured<br/>
"I had a great time with you and your family. But is fair that you have to rest"</p><p>"What about you my lord? Can I help you to take you home" said Juri pulling a kasa from his back.</p><p>"Oh no, it's better you stay here. I'll take the river path is faster and I know it well"</p><p>"Lord: Is it about your family? You live in the forest like that?" Pointing to the exquisite silk of Taiga's kimono.</p><p>"Stop it! I've already told you I'm not a lord"</p><p>Juri eyes got bigger and his jaws dropped</p><p>"A yokai!" Juri fell in seiza and put his head near the soil between his hands.<br/>
"Please, don't hurt my family. Take me to the forest if you want so, but they have families to take care of"</p><p>Taiga kneeled down in front of Juri.<br/>
"I'm 100% human. I swear it.<br/>
And the path along the river is safe and quick back home"</p><p>Juri looking directly to Taiga eyes asked<br/>
"If you are human, you dress too much like a daimyo relative. But also you said to me you aren't a lord. You steal a kimono from death or something?"</p><p>Finally, Juri stumped the elephant in the room.<br/>
"Is more complicated"<br/>
Juri stared at him in disbelief, raising an eyebrow.<br/>
"You indeed are a thief… a ronin or worst a killer"<br/>
"Please do not be afraid," Taiga said, putting his hands on top of Juri's shoulders.<br/>
"I'm a Kagema".</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>"I'm a  Kagema".</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"A what?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga realized quickly that not every class knew about his existence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Just forget about it. It was a superb time, but excuse me". Taiga bowed, raised from his position and started walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri is very stubborn and can't let things like that happen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Perhaps I'm only a fisherman. But I also served in the army, if you explain I can understand" said Juri, grabbing the silk kimono of this strange man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri decided to make him understand that he is not gonna let whatever human takes him for fool just for his poor boy appearance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You saw the Oiran parade?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri nodded at Taiga's question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"There are other people there, the young maiko, geiko, komuro…" seeing juri nodding, Taiga kept going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I was there too, last year. Not as spectator but as a part of it"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri was confused, but tried to maybe find Taiga's face between his memories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were mens holding the umbrella for the Oiran, or those who helped her walk in those big geta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Seeing the face of Juri, Taiga tried to be clearer, knowing that maybe the truth would not be welcomed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I was dress with a big ornaments, and my hair was long with long bangs"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri backed his head and only said "oh"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was that: the fearest impresion Taiga could have. He instantly looked at his feet feeling a bit down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So you exist in this town? That amazing"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked into Juri's eyes with disbelief without saying a single word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Boy, I was in the army. At young corps" Juri said with a cocky smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't catch the meaning behind it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"The only reason that a poor boy like me didn't got hurt at war, is because I was the favorite of the commander"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri laughed hard, and patched Taiga's shoulder. Still, he couldn't understand it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You are the rich's Danshou, aren't you?, well, at the front commander can't get your precious services, and selects different boys to help him with that"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was dumbfoled, he thought that juri was an innocent fisherman but never thought he had a master. He never thought that outside of his comrades would find someone who understands him about the sex business.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"C'mon ease! Hey rich boy, commander wasn't that bad. I hadn't ornaments or recognition but at least because I satisfied him I didn't get hurt" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just smiled. They have a tacit understanding now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He also has a really nice education and lifestyle because he was good at bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Let's walk, I need to down the sake… and you need an umbrella"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga smiled again. This looked like someone was playing with his destiny. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded and started walking towards the river path to reach his home before the sunset.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Now we're friends, you must have stories to talk about. How about the richest customer you ever had"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What you want: the samurai or the daimyo's daughter"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Juri thought:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Surprise me!, just told me everything you want until we head downtown edo"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You might be surprised, but my first appearance was as a onnagata. I really was loved back then, so I thought it maybe not that bad"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked shy. He never told his history to anybody. His work was about entertaining and satisfying the client, not that really his client was interested in his persona.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I only saw onnagata once. I thought they were girls!, but commander wasn't that stupid to let boys come close to any girl" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri said between laughs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Was the first time that actually the young corps were fighting and leading the battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, as reward, Commander took us to a kabuki theater to watch young ladies perform"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something clicked in Taiga</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Do you remember the name of the teather?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Do it has names?, is the one near here which was burned to ashes"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga now remembers clearly. He stopped and bowed in front of juri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Kyoko, is my pleasure"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri widened his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No chance!, you were one of them?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not only one, the main. They said I was outstanding voice natural like a girl"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed Taiga's arm to protect him again with his kasa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Peach kimonos! Yeah! I remember everything… even the one tall who actually give the impression of being a male"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Daisuke kun, he was my friend back then. The whole week we were in rehearsals to test with audience if we really can play onnagata"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Destiny? Taiga thought. From all the people of the world he has to meet Juri again. That night was decisive in his career, between all his teammates the head of the Kabuki clan had chosen him as leader. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even more, he has such vivid memories of that day, that he is sure if he tries he can find the face of Juri between the attendances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You were fabulous! Until a stupid senpai just crushed the feelings of all of us telling about it: those aren't girls"</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga smiled. Juri was like a medicine. Everything was so calming and so soothing. Doesn't matter if he laughs wholeheartedly or tells stories mimicking, even if he is noisy: he makes the best noise ever.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Juri has his own memories about them and how they figure out about the onnagata nature. He doesn't hesitate to tell Taiga about it, making him just get carried out carefree in his part of the story.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> "So you have only men?" Said out of blue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Our clients are men and women, sometimes both even. The main thing is to satisfy the client. Whatever task: talking, gaming, drinking, and …"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Taiga never faced in words what it means to be a kagema. He just never explained to anybody. The kabuki, his Otosan, his friends were all in the same business. The women he knows are clients or others working like him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Prostitution" Juri interrupted his thoughts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Nothing bad at it, someones who can pay for it, have the best faces or bodies or whatever he likes"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Juri was indeed more mature than Taiga thought at the beginning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Juri closed the umbrella after seeing  there's no more rain pouring on top of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Who kisses better, men or women?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Is a tie. It depends, men and women kiss differently"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"But you have to have a favorite"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As a matter of fact, Taiga doesn't have a favorite customer. He works with the same compromise with everyone, he doesn't have a personal feeling involved in that sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Is a secret. I can't divulge anything" he lies. He doesn't have one to pick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Besides, I'm retired. Remember?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So what about an advice"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked into Juri's face confused, and Juri quickly got the point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"About kissing"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga laughed sheepishly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You were the favorite of your commander!. I think I'm the one who can get an advice" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri for the first time is the one who blocks the path and stops walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'll pay you!, just help me with that"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga doesn't know how to get out of this uncomfort place, instead of getting free he ends up messing it up more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Maybe you are just good. Natural. I don't know… "</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"But you are a pro, nobody better than you for this kind of advice"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed both Taiga arms firmly and came close until his nose was almost touching Taiga's cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga faced him looking into his eyes with his heart running like in a death danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"What about it? That close?" Juri murmured, then laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga surely looked petrified. He feared he might show some emotional response to it. He shouldn't, he was a top ranked male prostitute, he must not feel something at a kiss. But his body betrayed him, he blushed and his voice got hoarse in a minute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I think, (coughed) you have natural talent"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They keep walking in silence for a couple of meters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You quitted or were fired?" Juri again initiates the conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I reached the age of twenty last december. I'm no longer… clients won't ask for me because I'm old" Taiga sighed with the last phrase.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Whoa! I thought you were younger. You are only a year older than me!" Juri got back with the noisy self that made Taiga's heart flutter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"We are young! If you want you can start over. Whatever you want. Fishing is tough, but the best thing is to travel with the seasons. What about you? What do you want to do?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was never asked about what he wanted to do. His work was fulfilling others' desires. Even though he enjoyed being praised on stage or when he performed, Taiga never asked himself if he really wanted that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri elbowed him, expecting an answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Maybe I'll start fishing. Do you think I'm suitable for the work?" With the silly answer Taiga tried to keep up with Juri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sure, Rich Boy! Your hands would get red as hell in the first hour" Juri laughed his lungs off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not more than 4 hours straight playing shamisen for a client. He was so old, he only wanted to hear nice music before sleep" Taiga rolled his eyes in his last phrase.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"My hands… I had bandages for a week. I couldn't even feel it for the rest of the day. But, was the price to pay in the beginning, I was 14 I think. And he was a old, a very old General, after that everyone thought I was compromised with the work"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again, Taiga is Taiga after all, and in the most silly chat he turned on serious work life -meditation talk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I know, I'm boring" Taiga said after a couple of seconds only hearing the sound of his zori and Juri's waraji on the soil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No boring. Is quite surpriseful a person who works giving pleasure with such a deep thinking"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taig looked at juri raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No pun intended about deep thinking"  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It 's ok. People around me always say to me, I overthink. So, I'm boring. Do you think it's true?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You think because you are not a shitake. Life is a balance. My family thinks the opposite, that I don't think or never feel nervous or at ease because I never tell them. But I do. I think when I throw my nets at the sea, when I don't know what to do I prepare the nets for the next day and my head gets clear again"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From different jobs, from different backgrounds and even without speaking too much they get to understand each other like they know for a lastliving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So different, for saying the least, but their heartbeat is on the same tune.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Hey, ease a bit!" Juri throws a punch on Taiga's left shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Mind your hands, I know how to defend myself. I'm not a little girl, mister army boy"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Gotta offended, rich boy?" Juri laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Show me what you are capable to, unless we are speaking of chamber arts I don't think you know so much"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For some reason he can't explain, Taiga enters Juri's game with ease. He likes to get teased by Juri, he never liked before from anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So he does the demonstration of what he had learnt during his kabuki training years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Quickly, took the umbrella from juri's hands and folded it to form it like a weapon. After that, he stood in the first kata, to jump with one arm punching the right side of the face and the other one stabbing with the umbrella the left side of Juri's waist. Finishing the movement with a high scream.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri was petrified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Surprising… I mean, thanks it's only a kasa and not a katana otherwise I'll be dead for sure. Where did you learn that? It's nothing to do with playing instruments"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Kabuki"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I always liked to try the way they look … aragoto, that is called?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Now, that I'm free, I can teach you"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The phrase he just said instinctively lit up a fire inside him. A passion renewed for his new path in his life after retirement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"That would be awesome! From fisher to stage… that's a dream!" Indeed Juri always has dreamed of being something more than a fisher, be like a great warrior, people admiring him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed Taiga's arms and pulled on a hug, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm glad that I found you, even more, I feel like you are part of my family already," Juri said in Taiga's ears. He was hollowed in his destiny as a fisherman, a tiny spark of hope is all he needed to believe again in his future.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't even try to hide his reddish cheeks. Instead, immediately, dropped the kasa in his left hand and rushed both of his arms on a tight hug on Juri's waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm the one who is saved by your presence in my life. At the river or now, always you" Taiga expressed himself sobbing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Certainly, he found another soul to be confident about many uncertainties of his life that now have another meaning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They parted the hug, just for staring into the deep sea of each other's eyes. Tsuyu. The rain again, pouring furiously directly on top of their heads interrupted the most intimate magic moment in which Taiga and Juri connected their souls in one look.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri let Taiga go, kneel and grab the kasa. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Better to take care, we are close to Edo"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just hummed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now it feels awkward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga is unsure about what Juri would do once they reach Edo. At the end of the river path is a nice soribashi that they have to cross, after that some small village starts to grow, and a few meters later his tea house.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There's not much time to think, once they start seeing the city, they have to walk down and walk across the bridge and they will reach Edo. Juri only said he would help him to walk to the city without getting wet during the downpour, something inside his chest says he can't let him go so easily, without saying anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Still drunk? Or could you get another round of shochu?" Taiga said playfully almost with arrogance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Too much water on my face, too much walking on my feet, I'm sober now" looking directly into Taiga face</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Nah, better I pass for another round"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Definitely a mood killer, another failed tactic. He doesn't have many other opportunities, he knows the river path. The current is connected to sumida river following the entire Edo city. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He puts his hands inside of his sleeves and he remembers his lucky charms. Everything had begun because of them, he had to take the chance and not chicken out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Juri, Do you believe in luck? Do you think that maybe there is something out there for us?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sometimes yes, you just have to throw your nets and wait to see what that brings" Juri said so calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga eyed the bright red bridge just a few meters in front of them, and decided to take action without hesitation knowing he hasn't anything to lose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Juri…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After saying the other one's name, he grabbed Juri's nape, blocked his way with his own body and kissed him fiercely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rain was equally bad as before, but Taiga decided this was his last chance and had to make it worth it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri instead, never expected this. He has been told several times that beautiful creatures which only live in the woods and to love them is the perdition of the human. How can this be possible? He tried to kiss him playfully two times before, and got rejected very coldly and politely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now he can appreciate how Taiga's lips are made of silk. Warm, silky and enough pressure to feel it and not hurt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted more. His body reacted following his heart, he dropped his useless umbrella to get a hand in Taiga's neck and another on his waist, attracting his body closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The good things last short. Taiga parted the kiss letting go of Juri's neck slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga bitted his lower lip and looked down at his feet for a second feeling his cheeks burning and his own breath choking in his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a naive, almost a pure virgin kiss. For Juri it can't be true that in front of him the reddish face biting his lip because they just kissed, is a famous male prostitute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grins, is fated. He pulls Taiga from the waist and tugs his hairs for a deeper kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, Juri intended to demonstrate him not who is a pro, but he is the one who truly deserves Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His tongue slides cautiously into Taiga's open mouth. He sucks deeply, mapping every corner of the mouth until his precious lips. Juri isn't egoist, he tilts his head enough to make it easy for Taiga to reach him equally. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the middle of the perfect heated kiss, Taiga started laughing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sorry"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri looked dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You promised me to reach Edo without getting wet…" Taiga didn't manage to end the phrase and started laughing again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In fact, it was a mess. Both were drenched, not a single part of them dried. Their hair was the worst and the umbrella was broken lying on the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri laughed too with all his might, seeing both trying to be romantic in the middle of the storm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With entwined fingers they walked across the soribashi. At the end, they exchanged a sweet smile knowing they have reached Edo. Even though they know this is not the end, it is a tacit understanding they have to leave the affection to some private place. The forest has been very private for them, this is time to face many other eyes.</span>

<p>That doesn't mean that the fun ends there at the soribashi. They started to run like childs into the littles homes' eaves shielding from the horrible copious rain falling on them, if they couldn't get wet enough yet.</p><p>Some old persons caught them laughing and running like two childs down the rain and gave them disapproving looks, even shushed them.</p><p>Between taberns, finally, a great house with a big yard and big mural surround them presented to them.</p><p> </p><p>"Be my guest of honor, welcome to my world" Taiga said, opening a big decorated wooden door.</p><p>After opening that door, there was an oasis. It looks like a garden of one of the Imperial palaces, so neat and gorgeous.</p><p>To enter one of the outside galleries Taiga stepped out of his zori and kneeled down to face it towards the entrance. Juri tried to do the same, but he had trouble with his shoes. When he tried to follow Taiga outside the Izakaya, his waraji slowed him down. Seeing this problem, Taiga sat in seiza in front of him.</p><p>"Let me take care of this, you are my guest after all" he smiled kindly.</p><p>Taiga undo the shoe laces that were until Juri's knees and tangled with the tabi's fasteners.</p><p>Meanwhile Juri was absorbed seeing the peaceful expression drawn in Taiga face</p><p>How can he be that happy? He sees himself not deserving of that special treatment. His shoes made of straw were not very new, his tabi were in fact Hyoga's, his tatsuke was ordinary indigo blue, and his kosode was tugged like every fisherman into his obi.</p><p>Taiga once he finished with the shoes looked at his guest with a big smile.</p><p>"Why do you do all of this?" Juri asked</p><p>Taiga frowned</p><p>"I'm just a poor fisherman, and I don't think that you gift your services to anybody"</p><p>Taiga pulled out of his sleeve his special lucky charm: the pink one.</p><p>"The main priest of the inari I visited today gave this, thinking of me. I was there to pray for luck on business, and he gave this special one: to pray for love. I couldn't abandon it and let the river wash it… then you found me"</p><p>Juri couldn't resist any more and gave him a sweet kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga grabbed Juri's hand and between little laughs conducted him through the corridors of the majestic tea house. Until they reached the entrance of a special place made of wood and rocks. Taiga opened the door saying,</p><p>"This is a special ofuro for guests, where our servants or apprentices can help to bathe them and change. Since we are alone today let me help you"</p><p>"Nah, I don't think so" juri refused</p><p>"Juri, I've seen thousands of men, you don't have anything I didn't already see"</p><p>"You forgot I'm not your client. Is awkward, even my commander knows a little more about romance"</p><p>Taiga laughs, internally knowing that Juri is right, so many years of splitting sex from feelings that he doesn't remember how they felt all together.</p><p>"Let's do it on your own terms mister Tanaka, after all you are my guest and should be treated as kings"</p><p>"I'm gonna bathe because it is freezing and I get your not-so-subtle message that I stink. While, you will do all your preps"</p><p>Taiga showed his excitement with a jump and a "Yosh".</p><p>"But… you won't put on any wig or any makeup, or anything horrible. Just something simple, be you in a beautiful kimono… not 12 layers of it… keep it simple"</p><p>Taiga nodded and for showing agreement gave a peck in Juri's lips.</p><p>After that, he gave fewer indications to find the correct room. </p><p>Taiga also took a bath very quickly. He smeared a special lotion to his skin which always was praised by special clients. Then selected his red and gold kimono, he never used it like that, it was only for ceremonial purposes .He put it in front of a mirror on top of his white nagajuban. He kept his promise and only brushed his hair. With nothing else to polish, he went  to the room they would share. </p><p> </p><p>Juri took off all his wet clothes. It was a mess, between his muddy and wet clothes and the nerve wracking situation. Never in his life having sex would be so complicated. The water in the tanks was lukewarm and helped him to relax a bit. There was at least space for 3 other people, so luxurious and comfortable.</p><p>He tried to blank his mind of this nonsense. In a good way, he never thought he might meet someone at lunch and sleep with him at noon.</p><p>He tried his best to appear before him like one deserves him. He can't erase the calluses of his hands and feets, but can at least try to clean his body and hair.</p><p>There were numerous types of bottles, but Taiga only pointed to one, and he used that one to reduce the odor.</p><p>He toweled himself, grabbed one nagajuban from the pile and put it on. He doesn't go to the next room to get the top kimono, because he thought he might be late, and because they would take the clothes off anyways.</p><p> </p><p>Clients mostly paid for the companion and the kagema would fit if they additionally performed other activities such as dances or music. The rooms were organized by the Otosan by the quality of the client and the services they would get. Taiga was the main one of the tea house, once reaching the age of 20 there's "expiration date".</p><p>His mind was wandering all around while he was waiting for Juri in seiza. He is his first non client, non colleague, non work related- he was a virgin in terms of feelings. The unknown path is frightening, is love feeling that way? Or just pure body attraction?. He cracked his knuckles, grabbing his loved omamori. Even the most intrusive thoughts came across, "Maybe I'm waiting in vain. And Juri ran away from this madness".</p><p>Suddenly, the fusuma opened. Juri was nervous as hell, and with all his strength pulled the corridor door aside. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. I got lost. I think this is the third one I visit”</p><p>After saying it, he got muted by the scene in his eyes. Here he was, like a courtesan of the emperor with his head on the tatami to welcome him in submission, like a great Lord. </p><p>Even though that was per se very impressive, the whole scene became a dream when Taiga lifted his head.</p><p>“Okaerinasaimase, goshujinsama. Taiga Gozaraimasu, yoroshiku onegaishimasu”</p><p> </p><p>His face was luminous, his hair, his kimono, everything in his appearance makes you realize why he was the most requested. Taiga beauty was on another level.</p><p>The room was massive, and Juri tried to focus on everything else instead of his own insecurities. Hence, he distracted his heartbeat just asking for everything in the room. </p><p>He walked a couple of steps from the entrance to the opposite direction and opened the shogi.</p><p>“Why? I mean, there’s another room. Are other people with us?” Juri asked with certain apprehension.</p><p>“Is for the clients” Taiga smiled a bit and ceremoniously stood up. </p><p>“Sometimes, when clients are women… some women prefer to see, not to be part, so the client select two kagemas to, you know perform some acts and entertain her”</p><p>Juri closed the doors silently with more nervousness than before.</p><p>Taiga knew his world was unaware for most of the people. He has been hidden in the shadows for 10 years of training, and now has to change to another set of life.</p><p>“When we first meet the other party, we share tea. And then can request what they become to get”</p><p>Taiga invited Juri with his hand demeanor to the tokonoma where the sadou was arranged.</p><p>Juri saw around all the manners of this type of encounter: tea place, music instruments, shodo, flowers and the magnificent view to the private garden. But something was missing there. </p><p>“I don’t need any of this. Because the only thing I want is you”  Juri approached quickly and caressed the right cheek of Taiga feeling the warmth of the skin against his. </p><p>That was exactly what Taiga needed. Feel like “someone”, not like “something”. He simply felt a burning sensation inside, something, a need to take Juri closer. With all the rush of emotions, he softly kissed him.</p><p>Juri gave a lopsided smile to Taiga after such a tender kiss. Although, working all day at sea fishing can make your nose lose some sensitivity, Juri loved the new flowers perfume blooming at each season. Helding close to Taiga he felt a nice floral perfume on him, just like a blooming spring. His heart flutters just being in front of him, seeing such natural beauty with such a lovely soul in one person.</p><p>He caresses Taiga's face once more like he was touching the most refined porcelain, he follows the trace of his jaw to end in his neck. He couldn't bear it anymore, and passionately kissed him.</p><p>Nobody has treated him in that way, it was like each other can communicate without even speaking.  Taiga felt this time. Since Juri appeared, kissing wasn’t just performing, it was something else more deep, a need from the bottom of his chest to never let go Juri.</p><p>He let Juri dominate the kiss, he needed this kind of contact, let him explore and set the pace with his tongue. </p><p>Juri was there only for Taiga, and for most rare it could sound he wanted to make it count. He wanted to love him like no one else has, to cure that little sad look he had when he found him at the muddy river. He kept his hands exploring the neck, then the cleavage and wanted more.</p><p>Juri kept kissing the long pale neck of taiga and even ventured to reach every part of visible skin. Taiga made a cute noise between little laughs, when Juri kissed his earlobes.  </p><p>“So prude, for being a pro, isn’t it?”</p><p>“What happened with your kimono? I prepared one for you” Taiga shifted the subject to hide his own embarrassment of being turned on by just a touch. </p><p>“The only thing in my mind now, is just take out all that fabric off you, so already did it with mine” </p><p>In fact, his kimono was tied up in a way to let everything flow without any troubles for the client, and still semi dressed. Seems that Juri had another idea, and Taiga wanted to try Juri’s way.</p><p>While Juri was focussed just kissing him and letting his hands explore, Taiga showed the way to him to untie his obi at the front of his kimono.</p><p>Taiga walked to the sophisticated futon holding hands with his partner. And let Juri slide the kimono from his shoulders at the side of the futon. Now, only the thin layer of white silk separates the two hot bodies. He was there not knowing how to act, always the client told everything necessary at the tea or beforehand to the Otosan. Not even the hierarchy rule help him, he has no clue, he must surrender to Juri’s pace. </p><p>“What? Do you regret something?” Juri noticed he was quieter than before, and even his hands didn't hug him like in the forest.</p><p>“No,That is what I want but I just… I don’t know how”</p><p>Juri laughed, indeed he thought that for being a fisherman he lost many of the greatest things of life, but he couldn’t help it for felt a bit of pity for Taiga who didn’t experience lust, desire or anything alike with being in love with another person. </p><p>“Just Follow me, I’ll make you mine”</p><p>His hands focused on caressing him through the nagajuban, trying to make Taiga feel the need to discard the only clothes in his body.</p><p>Taiga tried to read Juri, so he mimicked the same technique on him, adding a trail of kisses to his long and slender neck.</p><p>The connection between them was undeniable, they started grinding their hips to each other without any word exchange.</p><p>Taiga took another decision to know what role Juri wanted to play: he undoed Juri's nagajuban, exposing the nakedness of his front body.</p><p> The fisherman's body was sculpted by the hours of hard work. Although he might be seen at first sight as a very fragile and low weight young man, the exhausting work  left a superbs abs and toned muscles.</p><p>He started with feather touches at Juri's genitals with his own while fiercely kissing him. To his surprise, Juri didn't back down, even more so he grabbed Taiga hand to cope his dick while he moved his hips.</p><p>Juri took a step forward and reached for Taiga's butt to knead it. That sign was all that the experienced kagema needed to know how to pleasure him.</p><p>Juri hugged him while kneeling on the futon. The skin of Taiga looked so pristine, white, smooth, and even smelled so good and elegant that Juri couldn't cope with the desire to print his own mark on it. Sat facing each other, Juri directly attacked Taiga's neck, sucking, licking and kissing him mercilessly. To his surprise, the kagema finally makes a pleasure sound tilting his head to offer his neck to him.</p><p>Taiga was truly interested in Juri. Some pride inside him wanted to show him that he still the best, after his 20, is better than ever. He has the experience and the body to make him climb to heaven. He grabbed Juri's hair and caressed his scalp, until he pulled him out of his neck, to start playing with him.</p><p>He didn't apply force kissing him, but the opposite, he teases him, slowly building a rute in his neck towards his earlobes. A fisherman, so handsome with such a luscious body, his ears were tiny, filled with sensations as he could find sucking it.</p><p>He kept coming forward, Taiga went down from Juri's neck to his clavicles, kissing and caressing every inch of skin in his path.</p><p>He slipped the nagajuban off Juri's shoulders. His skin was tanned and his body slender and worked out, only the view made Taiga to bite his lower lip.</p><p>He smiled playfully before showing his abilities to Juri. Slowly pushed Juri back from his shoulder to make him lay flat on his back on the futon.</p><p>He caressed his abdomen to reach his button belly and teased him, started trailing a path kissing his linea alba until he met with the first pubic hair. He looked directly into his eyes before licking his lips to direct his attention to the main dish.</p><p>He grabbed Juri's member and looked him directly in the eyes and engulfed it slowly.</p><p>Then started playing with the tip, kissing and licking it, without breaking eye contact. </p><p>He knows what has the best results, how to make it quickly or make him hard painfully slowly. He always said he has a devilish personality, and he wanted to edge Juri to make it feel unforgettable.</p><p>Even if what he most wanted at the time was seeing the cute angelical face giving him a head, the waves of pleasure made him close his eyes from time to time. He was defeated, he couldn't kept quiet and moaned, his hips was shaking without his control directly fucking Taiga's mouth.</p><p>Juri had fallen directly in his charms. When Juri opened his eyes, he had prepared a show for him to view, teasing his dick' tip and opened his mouth at the end to show a trail of saliva between his mouth and juri's member. It was exactly as hard as he wanted, he must continue with his foreplay to edge him and make him last as he knows.</p><p>Taiga did a trace of kisses though all the abdomen to claim his mouth. Juri was more than welcoming, he sucked Taiga lips to the extent to make him feel his lips numb. He also grabbed tightly his waist to approach him, making him flat, resting his weight on his elbows on the futon, touching each other's abdomen. Juri almost tears the white piece of silk off Taiga's shoulders to keep worshiping his body. It was immediately, like a reflex, while Juri kissed and sucked Taiga's neck their bodies moved in search of more friction, skin to skin, in the most sexy manners.</p><p>It was difficult not to make excessive noise for him, even if he tried his best Taiga's moans were audible enough to turn on even more Juri. Juri let go of his waist and by the ends of the nanjuban, which was still fastened on Taiga's waist, started caressing and kneading his muscles, and buttocks.</p><p>Taiga sat up on Juri's hips and smiled.</p><p>"I think you are ready, don't you?" Said playfully. He smeared a special oil on his hands in a vase near the edge of the futon. He put a lot of it on Juri's dick.</p><p>"I do, who on earth can't be hard with such a splendid view?"</p><p>"Well, let's play then"</p><p>"And you? I don't want to hurt you" juri was concerned.</p><p>"I'm a pro, remember? Already did what it needs, let me show you"</p><p>He grabbed Juri's cock from the base and slowly inserted it in his own hole.</p><p>Juri moaned at the warm feeling expanding from his dick to his entire body.</p><p>After every centimeter was inside, Taiga grabbed Juri's hands and intertwined his fingers to start moving. The pace was increasing, always with his eyes fixed on the fisherman' ones.</p><p>He started slowly, making circles with his own hips. Taiga arched his back and pulled out his butt to make his body wave, building the pace. Juri surrendered to the pleasure of the experienced riding technique of the Kagema. Even though it was more than good as he was feeling, he couldn't bear to keep his hands still without enjoying the precious skin of Taiga. He loosened up Taiga hands so he could explore a bit of the skin behind the white undergarment that seems Taiga didn't want to let go. He began with his chubby thighs and continued with caressing his butt. The view was marvelous, the silk bathrobe off his shoulders until his elbows, his waist marked by the fastened and the white silk covering everything else.</p><p>Juri ripped out the last piece of cloth while Taiga kept moving. His restless hands again attacked Taiga's legs and buttocks. Everything went smoothly until Juri grabbed Taiga's member and gave him a few strokes. </p><p>"What happened?" Juri was worried when Taiga stopped moving and even put both hands in front like covering his dick.</p><p>"We are not allowed, we're not touched like this" Taiga refused to be touched in a form he isn't used to.</p><p>Juri sat crossing his legs without pulling out, hugging him tightly.</p><p>"You are retired, Taiga isn't a pleasure object. Just, give your own freedom to start feelling"</p><p>Taiga nodded understanding that he was a different person now, he must face the new era in his life.</p><p>Juri started kissing him, making noises every time he sucked those precious lips. He grabbed Taiga's waist with one hand Taiga's waist, and with the free hand again stroked his cock.</p><p>It was a craziness to break all the rules he grew up with, at the same time a relieving experience not to follow a strict routine or procedure just to have sex.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes and sighed, then focused to just think of Juri. He got goosebumps, his skin got on fire on every part in which Juri has contact. His cheeks get flushed when his ears open to Juri's noises. Finally, he put both arms on Juri's shoulders and got even more closer, without even thinking about it, a loud moan escaped from him. Although the surprise of his own voice kept reasoning in his ears, he kept vocalizing every sensation without the shame feeling he had had before.</p><p>Juri wanted to keep hearing that voice, so he focused on letting him have a nice remembrance: a nice hickey on his neck. He moved to Taiga's neck, kissing and sucking every part of it. When he reached his Adam apple, Taiga moaned louder and the vibration of his voice was conducted directly to Juri's tongue.</p><p>It was good, but not enough. Taiga moved his hips in circles again, to build a pace riding him. He didn't think, his body moved by instinct searching for his own pleasure.</p><p>He used to think that would be an egoist, but the more he bounced on Juri's dick for his own selfish pleasure, the more moans escaped from his partner. Juri was perfect for him, he felt a compatibility right in the beginning and he aroused naturally by only feeling his hands on his body.</p><p>Juri noticed how hard his kagema was, and focused on making him bounce deep and fast, so he didn't want to just lay there enjoying like a client. He leaned back holding on one arm to be able to thrust upwards while holding tightly with the other hand on Taiga's waist. </p><p>The thing wasn't performing or just fulfilling a task, hence they lost the sense of time fucking his brain out. Juri was aware of Taiga precum being smeared on his belly and he neither can last more like this. </p><p>"I want to see your face riding me once more" and he reclined back on the futon.</p><p>"Juri" was the only thing Taiga could say, like there weren't any other words in his vocabulary.</p><p>As a pro, Taiga rode him, moving his body like his life depended on. All those years in the industry, and he knew he was close, but he didn't want to ruin everything. He earnestly tried to hold on without slowing down his pace.</p><p>"Taiga, I'm…" Juri said clenching his theets.</p><p>He gave up. He put both hands on Juri's chest and just let his body free of inhibitions. A couple of thrusts after he came on Juri's abdomen.</p><p>He reached Juri's lips hungrily. He hugged him and supplicate</p><p>"Keep going, you're not a client… please cum inside"</p><p>Juri did as he was told, both breathing heavily in each other's face without even blinking, he thrusted harder making a loud slapping sound.</p><p>He came with a howl sound, and kept thrusting until his body naturally stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga this time without breath kissed him like in the forest slowly, sloppy and tenderly. After a minute he pulled out and rested beside his lover.</p><p>Juri, still shuddering, pulls the red kimono which has been discarded beside the futon on top of them to protect them from the night chill.</p><p>The view of rain pouring at the private garden made them get back on his senses and take conscious of what just happened.</p><p> </p><p>"Juri, this is more than lucky, I can't explain why but the way you make me feel… is that! You make me feel. I was numb until I met you"</p><p>Juri just denied it, shaking his head. Although he knows how deeply these confessions came from, he didn't want to get too emotional.</p><p>"As I said, it's better to start learning how to fish'' Juri said casually, assuming that they won't part ways again.</p><p>"Or you want to learn kabuki arts?, I have some friends who can help us"</p><p>"Weren't you jobless?"</p><p>"As a kagema… I never thought that maybe I could be valuable for other thing"</p><p>Juri smiled,</p><p>"Well, but I want to tell my family about it"</p><p>"I'm counting on you to let me take the most valuable man of the Tanaka clan with me."</p>

<p>Chapter End Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>My idea began with the photo of the first chapter, Ooku and something I watched on YOUTUBE about prostitution in the Edo period. And my delussion began right there.<br/>This was on my drafts for almost 3 months, and dedicated a time to search some old japanese words that existed on Edo Period. It may be not accurate, but it is a little to feel the "era" where the story was happening.<br/>Thanks for reading up to the end.</p></blockquote>
