</p><p>Tsuyu is just beginning. Is a new beginning for him too. The first time he went out in ages. Although, everything in his room is nostalgic now. Ten years have passed, without taking a walk without all the garments. He looked in the mirror and saw his face without his makeup, and his new short hair.</p><p>He thought maybe visiting the mountain jinja to ask for an Omamori from Benzaiten for a lucky new era in his life.</p><p>Walking across the kagemajaya through the empty corridors to the front harimise.</p><p>It's done, Otosan would do a deal to merge his tea house. The guy that will be in charge is a good manager, and a good entertainer, even though he felt sad for not being enough to take care of it.</p><p>He walked several kilometers from the Yoyaku until get into the Jinja; he is well known for the monks there. He would say the principal priest has a little mercy for him and let him stay.</p><p>Walking back by sumida river trying to collect the goshuin, he saw the Ajisai in full bloom with the beautiful blue decorating the path.</p><p>He took the advice of the priest, and this time he'll ask a special Omamori of Ebisu for the good luck of the merge. The rain started pouring again, and made it more difficult to walk in zori with his silk hakama.</p><p>At least it felt at peace, praying and meditating in the forest made him exhale his worries and let them out.</p><p>He got both, one red omamori for arts fortune and a purple one for business fortune. And the main priest at Benzaiten shrine gave him a special pink one: for love.</p><p>In the middle of the rain, returning without an umbrella or Sugegasa to protect his head, he tried to hurry home. Of course, typical of his smug gait, he lost his balance and wobbled as he walked trying to grab hold of the tree branches along the way to prevent a big fall.</p><p>He sighed, his palms were red but at least he didn't fall off. Trying to re-arrange his hakama and kimono, saw his sleeves were empty and the omamori fell off.</p><p>He tried to collect them: but he couldn't see the pink one.It was special, the priest made it thinking of him, he can't leave it abandoned.</p><p>Looking everywhere, desperate at last luckily he saw it at a river ravine. He took off his zori and only in his white silk tabi tried to walk down to the river for his precious omamori.</p><p>But, everything was in vain, he slid off because of the muddy floor.</p><p>Centimeters before the catastrophe he felt a grip on his sleeve and then in his arm.</p><p>Silly him, he still tried to reach the lucky charm from being washed away by the rush of the river</p><p>"I must save it! I'm too close" he said without looking back.<br/>
Instead of letting it go, the grip got stronger and made it easier to kneel and reach his amulet from the muddy riverside.</p><p>"Got it" exclaimed joyfully. And thus he was pulled back to a safe place.</p><p>Now, he faces his savior for the first time, a boy almost his age.</p><p>"Shukun sama, I'm sorry for your robes" the boy bowed deeply.</p><p>He looked his dougi was a little loose, and his hakama ending a bit muddy. But, the most interesting thing was the boy calling him "lord". He quickly thought and rather than correct the boy, he rode the current.</p><p>"It's nothing wrong. If it weren't for you I could have fallen to the river, may I ask your name mr. savior?</p><p>"Tanaka" said bowing.</p><p>He didn't understand what he meant.</p><p>"We are the fisher clan of Edo, the biggest and kindest" said the boy with a bit of pride in his tone.</p><p>"I see. Tanaka. It Would be very difficult to call you if the clan is so big. Tell me your name"</p><p>"Yah" the boy messed up his hair "Just don't laugh, my name is Juri. I don't know what they were thinking of naming me that way. I suppose they wanted to be original"</p><p>"Do you know how kanji Juri is written?"</p><p>"Sorry Lord, I don't know. I don't know to write"</p><p>"Doesn't matter. You save me. I think it should be something calm like this forest, kanji represent your soul, right?"</p><p>Juri saw the palm of his hand reddish.</p><p>"My Lord, let me cure that. My mom have become an specialist of injuries with fishing nets"</p><p>He can't keep quiet and do nothing and keep this boy ignorant, in a lie.</p><p>"I'm not a Lord. I'm a… I think it is better you call me by my name. My name is Taiga. Nice to meet you"</p><p>Both bowed at the same time.</p><p>"The clan is resting in an izakaya by the river. Of course you can eat the best fish here only provided by Tanaka"</p><p>Taiga laughed. A bit inside him feels calm, refreshing, not talking about the same things all the time. Work has eaten most of his life and now facing a new beginning, he feels like by fortune can interact so freely. He has nothing to lose, so he gives it a try.</p><p>Juri is interesting. So self confident, proud of his work. Something Taiga desperately looks like a new ikigai.</p><p>Juri is a talking machine. All the way to the tavern he went talking about how hideous this climate is for fishing.</p><p>"Shukun sama" various men raised from the floor and bowed deeply.</p><p>"I prefer Taiga"</p><p>Juri saw him a bit troubled and eased the situation.</p><p>"Mom, can you help? He has his hands scattered"</p><p>A chubby lady came from the back of the frontline mens. She took his hands and looked at his palms.</p><p>"Nothing that bad. I have something. His hands are so fragile, so soft! this isn't luckily a big injury".</p><p>Of course, Taiga hands are not fisherman's hands.</p><p>The ointment was fresh with a little lemon perfume. He felt the relief quickly not only in his skin but in his soul. Those who called themselves friends of his were too far or too busy to cheer him up. Although he only knows the clan for a couple of minutes he felt them as relatives, even more like home warmth he ever desired.<br/>
Tsuyu as always is unpredictable. The rain got worse, so Juri and his father, the head of the Tanaka Clan insisted on staying at least until the rain was enough to come back home.</p><p>Juri and his brothers sat at a table and made a place for Taiga.</p><p>"Are you from Edo?" Juri asked, sharing a cup of Sake.</p><p>"Yes, I born here actually"</p><p>"Oh" all the members in the same table exclaimed. But the last statement made all tanaka's thought it was right, he was a noble man.</p><p>Juri saw a slightly uncomfortable face from his guest. And showed one of his virtues: being a calm friend.</p><p>"Neither of us were born here. It depends of the fishing season"</p><p>One of them on his left punched Juri on his arm "what are you talking about? we both were born at the same house". All of them laughed at the brothers playing as the boke and tsukkomi.</p><p>Is something in just watching them chat that makes it unique: the family. Of course the older brother has honorifics and at the same time plays with the minor of them and gets scolded too. Taiga just smiled just to see them.</p><p>"Taiga, are you here? You're not saying a single word!" Juri exclaimed, padding his shoulder.</p><p>"I'm just enjoying the moment, it's so funny hearing you" Taiga scratched his head " I don't know what topic to talk about".</p><p>"How about matsuri?" Said the older Naru.</p><p>"Oh man! I missed last year's dochu!" Subaru the youngest interrupted before Taiga had the opportunity to talk. He earned a good slap on his nape from Juri, "Baka be polite with my guest"</p><p>"I like matsuri, especially fireworks. But I don't have anyone to go with this year"</p><p>"So it's decided now you can join the Tanaka's Clan" Hyoga said, with the same pride of the clan as Juri talked before.</p><p>"Do you think a noble will go out with a fisherman? We are already thankful is right here chatting with us" Koki retorted.</p><p>All of these made the chat uncomfortable again, a place he wants to escape.</p><p>"Let them be a bunch of idiots. They're lonely too. And you Naru, should take your kids to the matsuri" Juri leaned on Taiga's shoulder "Do you believe this guy got really drunk and left the kids with Tanaka uncles?" Said between laughs.</p><p>"Aoi Sama will be there this year too"</p><p>The youngest is still excited about the oiran parade.</p><p>"She is very talented and tender" , Taiga said out of nowhere.</p><p>"Do you really know Taiyu?" Koki raised an eyebrow</p><p>"Jun tan brings botchan without even told us, we had to use something better than this rags"</p><p>"I'm the best" Juri said laughing to his brother and made the whole table laugh with him. Taiga was fascinated how Juri can handle these situations, how his laugh is contagious, in short his whole personality. Not fake and cold tatemae but a good and kindhearted smile.<br/>
The whole evening was impressive jokes, laughs, impersonations, Taiga couldn't recall how much time they spent sitting at the table.</p><p>He also let himself be. With a little help of the sake let out his mixture of innocent and pervy jokes. He thought he might sound lame, but Tanaka's laugh loudly.</p><p>"Hey Juri, he can't be here forever. Let him back with his wife. Unlike you, he must be missed at home"<br/>
Taiga again got tense.<br/>
"Looser, stop telling everyone I'm not married yet '' Juri yelled and laughed.<br/>
Taiga doesn't know how to answer this. So he politely bowed.<br/>
"Thanks Tanaka house for having me here. I'm just leaving. With your permission" and bowed directly to the head of the clan, Juri's father.<br/>
He quickly walked and put his zori stepping outside the bar.<br/>
He wasn't hurt exactly, just everything came to an end. He has to get back and keep going with his life. Even more, he is grateful to the gods he had the opportunity to breathe a nice fresh air and made his heart flutter for a bit.</p><p>Juri, instead, feels disappointed.<br/>
"Stupids!What did you say to him to make him angry?"<br/>
And he tried to stand. A bit difficult with all the sake he has drunk.<br/>
Still, he tried to follow Taiga by the road.<br/>
Casually he found him a couple of meters from there heading the forest's path.</p><p>"I'm sorry for my brothers. I have no intentions to hurt you in anyway" he told Taiga as he was walking from behind.</p><p>Taiga turned to look at him with a smile, and Juri tried to bow deeply.<br/>
Taiga's hands stopped him. And reassured<br/>
"I had a great time with you and your family. But is fair that you have to rest"</p><p>"What about you my lord? Can I help you to take you home" said Juri pulling a kasa from his back.</p><p>"Oh no, it's better you stay here. I'll take the river path is faster and I know it well"</p><p>"Lord: Is it about your family? You live in the forest like that?" Pointing to the exquisite silk of Taiga's kimono.</p><p>"Stop it! I've already told you I'm not a lord"</p><p>Juri eyes got bigger and his jaws dropped</p><p>"A yokai!" Juri fell in seiza and put his head near the soil between his hands.<br/>
"Please, don't hurt my family. Take me to the forest if you want so, but they have families to take care of"</p><p>Taiga kneeled down in front of Juri.<br/>
"I'm 100% human. I swear it.<br/>
And the path along the river is safe and quick back home"</p><p>Juri looking directly to Taiga eyes asked<br/>
"If you are human, you dress too much like a daimyo relative. But also you said to me you aren't a lord. You steal a kimono from death or something?"</p><p>Finally, Juri stumped the elephant in the room.<br/>
"Is more complicated"<br/>
Juri stared at him in disbelief, raising an eyebrow.<br/>
"You indeed are a thief… a ronin or worst a killer"<br/>
"Please do not be afraid," Taiga said, putting his hands on top of Juri's shoulders.<br/>
"I'm a Kagema".</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>"I'm a  Kagema".</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"A what?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga realized quickly that not every class knew about his existence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Just forget about it. It was a superb time, but excuse me". Taiga bowed, raised from his position and started walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri is very stubborn and can't let things like that happen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Perhaps I'm only a fisherman. But I also served in the army, if you explain I can understand" said Juri, grabbing the silk kimono of this strange man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri decided to make him understand that he is not gonna let whatever human takes him for fool just for his poor boy appearance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You saw the Oiran parade?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri nodded at Taiga's question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"There are other people there, the young maiko, geiko, komuro…" seeing juri nodding, Taiga kept going.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I was there too, last year. Not as spectator but as a part of it"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri was confused, but tried to maybe find Taiga's face between his memories.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were mens holding the umbrella for the Oiran, or those who helped her walk in those big geta.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Seeing the face of Juri, Taiga tried to be clearer, knowing that maybe the truth would not be welcomed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I was dress with a big ornaments, and my hair was long with long bangs"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri backed his head and only said "oh"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was that: the fearest impresion Taiga could have. He instantly looked at his feet feeling a bit down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So you exist in this town? That amazing"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked into Juri's eyes with disbelief without saying a single word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Boy, I was in the army. At young corps" Juri said with a cocky smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't catch the meaning behind it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"The only reason that a poor boy like me didn't got hurt at war, is because I was the favorite of the commander"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri laughed hard, and patched Taiga's shoulder. Still, he couldn't understand it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You are the rich's Danshou, aren't you?, well, at the front commander can't get your precious services, and selects different boys to help him with that"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was dumbfoled, he thought that juri was an innocent fisherman but never thought he had a master. He never thought that outside of his comrades would find someone who understands him about the sex business.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"C'mon ease! Hey rich boy, commander wasn't that bad. I hadn't ornaments or recognition but at least because I satisfied him I didn't get hurt" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just smiled. They have a tacit understanding now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He also has a really nice education and lifestyle because he was good at bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Let's walk, I need to down the sake… and you need an umbrella"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga smiled again. This looked like someone was playing with his destiny. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded and started walking towards the river path to reach his home before the sunset.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Now we're friends, you must have stories to talk about. How about the richest customer you ever had"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What you want: the samurai or the daimyo's daughter"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Juri thought:</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Surprise me!, just told me everything you want until we head downtown edo"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You might be surprised, but my first appearance was as a onnagata. I really was loved back then, so I thought it maybe not that bad"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked shy. He never told his history to anybody. His work was about entertaining and satisfying the client, not that really his client was interested in his persona.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I only saw onnagata once. I thought they were girls!, but commander wasn't that stupid to let boys come close to any girl" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri said between laughs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Was the first time that actually the young corps were fighting and leading the battle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, as reward, Commander took us to a kabuki theater to watch young ladies perform"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something clicked in Taiga</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Do you remember the name of the teather?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Do it has names?, is the one near here which was burned to ashes"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga now remembers clearly. He stopped and bowed in front of juri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Kyoko, is my pleasure"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri widened his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No chance!, you were one of them?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not only one, the main. They said I was outstanding voice natural like a girl"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed Taiga's arm to protect him again with his kasa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Peach kimonos! Yeah! I remember everything… even the one tall who actually give the impression of being a male"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Daisuke kun, he was my friend back then. The whole week we were in rehearsals to test with audience if we really can play onnagata"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Destiny? Taiga thought. From all the people of the world he has to meet Juri again. That night was decisive in his career, between all his teammates the head of the Kabuki clan had chosen him as leader. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even more, he has such vivid memories of that day, that he is sure if he tries he can find the face of Juri between the attendances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You were fabulous! Until a stupid senpai just crushed the feelings of all of us telling about it: those aren't girls"</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga smiled. Juri was like a medicine. Everything was so calming and so soothing. Doesn't matter if he laughs wholeheartedly or tells stories mimicking, even if he is noisy: he makes the best noise ever.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Juri has his own memories about them and how they figure out about the onnagata nature. He doesn't hesitate to tell Taiga about it, making him just get carried out carefree in his part of the story.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> "So you have only men?" Said out of blue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Our clients are men and women, sometimes both even. The main thing is to satisfy the client. Whatever task: talking, gaming, drinking, and …"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Taiga never faced in words what it means to be a kagema. He just never explained to anybody. The kabuki, his Otosan, his friends were all in the same business. The women he knows are clients or others working like him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Prostitution" Juri interrupted his thoughts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Nothing bad at it, someones who can pay for it, have the best faces or bodies or whatever he likes"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Juri was indeed more mature than Taiga thought at the beginning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Juri closed the umbrella after seeing  there's no more rain pouring on top of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Who kisses better, men or women?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> "Is a tie. It depends, men and women kiss differently"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"But you have to have a favorite"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As a matter of fact, Taiga doesn't have a favorite customer. He works with the same compromise with everyone, he doesn't have a personal feeling involved in that sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Is a secret. I can't divulge anything" he lies. He doesn't have one to pick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Besides, I'm retired. Remember?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So what about an advice"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked into Juri's face confused, and Juri quickly got the point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"About kissing"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga laughed sheepishly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You were the favorite of your commander!. I think I'm the one who can get an advice" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri for the first time is the one who blocks the path and stops walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'll pay you!, just help me with that"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga doesn't know how to get out of this uncomfort place, instead of getting free he ends up messing it up more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Maybe you are just good. Natural. I don't know… "</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"But you are a pro, nobody better than you for this kind of advice"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed both Taiga arms firmly and came close until his nose was almost touching Taiga's cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga faced him looking into his eyes with his heart running like in a death danger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"What about it? That close?" Juri murmured, then laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga surely looked petrified. He feared he might show some emotional response to it. He shouldn't, he was a top ranked male prostitute, he must not feel something at a kiss. But his body betrayed him, he blushed and his voice got hoarse in a minute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I think, (coughed) you have natural talent"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They keep walking in silence for a couple of meters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You quitted or were fired?" Juri again initiates the conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I reached the age of twenty last december. I'm no longer… clients won't ask for me because I'm old" Taiga sighed with the last phrase.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Whoa! I thought you were younger. You are only a year older than me!" Juri got back with the noisy self that made Taiga's heart flutter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"We are young! If you want you can start over. Whatever you want. Fishing is tough, but the best thing is to travel with the seasons. What about you? What do you want to do?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was never asked about what he wanted to do. His work was fulfilling others' desires. Even though he enjoyed being praised on stage or when he performed, Taiga never asked himself if he really wanted that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri elbowed him, expecting an answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Maybe I'll start fishing. Do you think I'm suitable for the work?" With the silly answer Taiga tried to keep up with Juri.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sure, Rich Boy! Your hands would get red as hell in the first hour" Juri laughed his lungs off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Not more than 4 hours straight playing shamisen for a client. He was so old, he only wanted to hear nice music before sleep" Taiga rolled his eyes in his last phrase.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"My hands… I had bandages for a week. I couldn't even feel it for the rest of the day. But, was the price to pay in the beginning, I was 14 I think. And he was a old, a very old General, after that everyone thought I was compromised with the work"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again, Taiga is Taiga after all, and in the most silly chat he turned on serious work life -meditation talk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I know, I'm boring" Taiga said after a couple of seconds only hearing the sound of his zori and Juri's waraji on the soil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No boring. Is quite surpriseful a person who works giving pleasure with such a deep thinking"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taig looked at juri raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No pun intended about deep thinking"  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It 's ok. People around me always say to me, I overthink. So, I'm boring. Do you think it's true?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You think because you are not a shitake. Life is a balance. My family thinks the opposite, that I don't think or never feel nervous or at ease because I never tell them. But I do. I think when I throw my nets at the sea, when I don't know what to do I prepare the nets for the next day and my head gets clear again"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From different jobs, from different backgrounds and even without speaking too much they get to understand each other like they know for a lastliving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So different, for saying the least, but their heartbeat is on the same tune.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Hey, ease a bit!" Juri throws a punch on Taiga's left shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Mind your hands, I know how to defend myself. I'm not a little girl, mister army boy"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Gotta offended, rich boy?" Juri laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Show me what you are capable to, unless we are speaking of chamber arts I don't think you know so much"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For some reason he can't explain, Taiga enters Juri's game with ease. He likes to get teased by Juri, he never liked before from anyone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So he does the demonstration of what he had learnt during his kabuki training years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Quickly, took the umbrella from juri's hands and folded it to form it like a weapon. After that, he stood in the first kata, to jump with one arm punching the right side of the face and the other one stabbing with the umbrella the left side of Juri's waist. Finishing the movement with a high scream.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri was petrified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Surprising… I mean, thanks it's only a kasa and not a katana otherwise I'll be dead for sure. Where did you learn that? It's nothing to do with playing instruments"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Kabuki"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I always liked to try the way they look … aragoto, that is called?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Now, that I'm free, I can teach you"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The phrase he just said instinctively lit up a fire inside him. A passion renewed for his new path in his life after retirement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"That would be awesome! From fisher to stage… that's a dream!" Indeed Juri always has dreamed of being something more than a fisher, be like a great warrior, people admiring him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grabbed Taiga's arms and pulled on a hug, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm glad that I found you, even more, I feel like you are part of my family already," Juri said in Taiga's ears. He was hollowed in his destiny as a fisherman, a tiny spark of hope is all he needed to believe again in his future.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't even try to hide his reddish cheeks. Instead, immediately, dropped the kasa in his left hand and rushed both of his arms on a tight hug on Juri's waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm the one who is saved by your presence in my life. At the river or now, always you" Taiga expressed himself sobbing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Certainly, he found another soul to be confident about many uncertainties of his life that now have another meaning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They parted the hug, just for staring into the deep sea of each other's eyes. Tsuyu. The rain again, pouring furiously directly on top of their heads interrupted the most intimate magic moment in which Taiga and Juri connected their souls in one look.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri let Taiga go, kneel and grab the kasa. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Better to take care, we are close to Edo"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just hummed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now it feels awkward. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga is unsure about what Juri would do once they reach Edo. At the end of the river path is a nice soribashi that they have to cross, after that some small village starts to grow, and a few meters later his tea house.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There's not much time to think, once they start seeing the city, they have to walk down and walk across the bridge and they will reach Edo. Juri only said he would help him to walk to the city without getting wet during the downpour, something inside his chest says he can't let him go so easily, without saying anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Still drunk? Or could you get another round of shochu?" Taiga said playfully almost with arrogance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Too much water on my face, too much walking on my feet, I'm sober now" looking directly into Taiga face</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Nah, better I pass for another round"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Definitely a mood killer, another failed tactic. He doesn't have many other opportunities, he knows the river path. The current is connected to sumida river following the entire Edo city. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He puts his hands inside of his sleeves and he remembers his lucky charms. Everything had begun because of them, he had to take the chance and not chicken out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Juri, Do you believe in luck? Do you think that maybe there is something out there for us?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sometimes yes, you just have to throw your nets and wait to see what that brings" Juri said so calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga eyed the bright red bridge just a few meters in front of them, and decided to take action without hesitation knowing he hasn't anything to lose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Juri…"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After saying the other one's name, he grabbed Juri's nape, blocked his way with his own body and kissed him fiercely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rain was equally bad as before, but Taiga decided this was his last chance and had to make it worth it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri instead, never expected this. He has been told several times that beautiful creatures which only live in the woods and to love them is the perdition of the human. How can this be possible? He tried to kiss him playfully two times before, and got rejected very coldly and politely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now he can appreciate how Taiga's lips are made of silk. Warm, silky and enough pressure to feel it and not hurt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted more. His body reacted following his heart, he dropped his useless umbrella to get a hand in Taiga's neck and another on his waist, attracting his body closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The good things last short. Taiga parted the kiss letting go of Juri's neck slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga bitted his lower lip and looked down at his feet for a second feeling his cheeks burning and his own breath choking in his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a naive, almost a pure virgin kiss. For Juri it can't be true that in front of him the reddish face biting his lip because they just kissed, is a famous male prostitute.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri grins, is fated. He pulls Taiga from the waist and tugs his hairs for a deeper kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, Juri intended to demonstrate him not who is a pro, but he is the one who truly deserves Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His tongue slides cautiously into Taiga's open mouth. He sucks deeply, mapping every corner of the mouth until his precious lips. Juri isn't egoist, he tilts his head enough to make it easy for Taiga to reach him equally. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the middle of the perfect heated kiss, Taiga started laughing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Sorry"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri looked dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You promised me to reach Edo without getting wet…" Taiga didn't manage to end the phrase and started laughing again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In fact, it was a mess. Both were drenched, not a single part of them dried. Their hair was the worst and the umbrella was broken lying on the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri laughed too with all his might, seeing both trying to be romantic in the middle of the storm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With entwined fingers they walked across the soribashi. At the end, they exchanged a sweet smile knowing they have reached Edo. Even though they know this is not the end, it is a tacit understanding they have to leave the affection to some private place. The forest has been very private for them, this is time to face many other eyes.</span>
