<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hours had passed, or at least that is what it felt like, as the ride over to Taiga’s home was filled with uncomfortable silence and irrelevant comments to fill the air. Taiga was just purely awkward, not knowing what to say to the other as in his world they were pretty much strangers as it had been some years since they had met. On the other hand, Kochi’s brain was occupied by multiple thoughts varying from “What have I just gotten myself into?” to “How the hell will I impress his parents? I’m already delt a hand of losing cards in this game.”</p><p>All too fast the ride was over. Whilst Kochi was left wondering just how he was supposed to behave around people of such different standing in life, Taiga was wondering if he should tell Kouchi that he wasn’t exactly sure how his parents would react to his chosen partner being male.</p><p>Taiga was given no room to worry as it seemed like it was the same second that they pulled to the driveway that his mother burst through the front door and was opening the passenger seat to see who was sitting there. Taiga was left fearing the worst, given that in the situation only he was aware that his parents where rather conservative at times.</p><p>“Oh, isn't it the young Kochi! Yugo is your name I believe!” Taiga’s mother was beaming at the young male left speechless for a moment at the passenger seat.</p><p>Taiga was stood still, unable to fathom the scene unfolding in front of him. His mom? Seemed to be smitten with the person, a male, chosen by the government? In Taiga’s mind in seemed to take no time for Kochi to recover and smile at his mom greeting her back with just as loving greeting, if not even more so.</p><p>“Ah, yes! I’m Kochi Yugo! Such a pleasure to meet you! Would it be too forward of me to call you mom? We are going to be relatives after all?”</p><p>Taiga was left staring dumb founded while Kochi sprung out of the car, linked arms with his mother and waltzed his way into their manor whilst Taiga's mother was throwing her head back at laughter as reaction to what Kochi had just said.</p><p>What Taiga was not aware of, was that Kochi was just as surprised as he was by the reaction that Taiga’s mother had just shown. He had just decided that he would be making the most of it.</p><p>If he could not be sure that the person, he was paired up with was able to love him, he would damn sure secure it so that someone had his side in the story, and made his life just a tad bit easier.</p><p>Taiga could see his father smiling at Kochi from the crack in the door as he walked out of his study, while he was also trying to get into the house. This had not been what he had expected. It had been something he had hoped for, but not something he had dared to dream for.</p><p>While Taiga was left marvelling at the reaction from his parents’, as it was far from what he had believed it would be. Kochi could tell that while Mrs. Kyomoto was honestly happy to meet him, Mr. Kyomoto was clearly not so fond of him. That thou would not stop Kouchi from giving it his best to win him over too, as in his head, that was where his key to happiness lay. If Taiga’s parents told him something, it seemed that he would follow with their decision. And Kochi just wanted to lead a basic simple happy life, even if it would mean being trapped in a loveless marriage.</p>
