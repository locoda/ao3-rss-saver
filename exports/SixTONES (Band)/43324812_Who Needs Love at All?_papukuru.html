<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Really. </p><p>What do you really do with love?</p><p>Taiga let out a long drawn out breath as he leaned back in his chair, throwing down his glasses onto his keyboard as he pinched the bridge of his nose. </p><p>He scowled to himself as he sat back up to hunch back over his desk and stare at the email from his editor again.</p><p>When would they finally get tired of asking?...</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Kyomoto. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>We really think it's within your best interest if you consider having a romance novel be your next project. Readers have been wondering forever when you will write something like your story from years ago! We're sure that it will be a great success. Please give us a call if you would like to discuss.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga had read the same email over and over again but just phrased with different words.</p><p>He sighed and laid his hands down on the keys.</p><p>"No… I don't… want… to…" Taiga said to himself, verbalizing each word he typed in his email back before sending it off without even adding a signature. </p><p>Time and time again, his publishing company asked him to write romance again. </p><p>Taiga had written one short story years ago that was published in a novice writer magazine. </p><p>
  <em>"Sapphire Bloom"</em>
</p><p>It was a story about a friendship that blossomed into an innocent love where they both learned what love was together. It had growing pains and a coming of age theme which warmed the reader's hearts with its relatability but captured them with the simple romance that bloomed between the two characters. </p><p>Taiga was thankful for the story as it was what allowed to become discovered and signed to what would be his current publishing company, but he never wrote a romance story again.</p><p>When Taiga had turned in his first manuscript to his new editor, he was shocked that it wasn't the romance story he was expecting. Instead, it was a grizzly murder mystery with dark and heavy tones. </p><p>Even if it wasn’t the romance novel he had discussed with his company prior, it was still good. The story was brought back to the section chief after his editor had read it, telling him that though it wasn’t what they wanted, it was still a story that would surely sell.</p><p>And it did. </p><p>It sold very well. </p><p>It sold well enough that Taiga wrote multiple sequels to the series, expanding and extending the universe that his fans and readers loved to get lost in its thrill. </p><p>But even with his ongoing success, he was still asked again.</p><p>
  <em>"Will you write a romance again?"</em>
</p><p>Taiga closed his email and looked over at the digital clock on his desk, the dim white numbers telling him the time. </p><p>5:48 am.</p><p>Guess it was time to sleep…</p><p>Taiga currently had what people called with the most technical terms,</p><p>"Writer's block."</p><p>It felt like his current series was dragged out as much as it possibly could have been. It even dragged out a couple of spin offs and side novels too long in Taiga’s opinion, but what made money, made money. </p><p>But when even the chief editor told him that it was time to move on, Taiga knew that it was actually time to move on. </p><p>And of course, it was easier said than done.</p><p>Taiga tried writing many different outlines, prompts and plots, but each felt bland, empty and uninspired. Every word he had written in the past week read like absolute garbage and was only a waste of memory space on his computer or ill spent graphite on paper. </p><p>Crafting a new story and new idea from the bottom up was more difficult than it seemed. Taiga wasn't able to just will a good idea into his head like so many editors assumed he could. Inspiration was truly the driver of creativity and frankly, Taiga had none. </p><p>He sighed as he pulled his covers over his head, curling into a ball as he shut his eyes tight, forcing himself to get some sleep before his meeting tomorrow. </p><p>Taiga did the math in his head. </p><p>9:00 am. </p><p>3 hours and 12 minutes of sleep until his editor knocked on his door. </p><p>His editor insisted that going outside or at least getting some "fresh air" would help him think of something new. </p><p>He argued that opening the window or going out on the balcony of his high rise apartment was no different, but she argued otherwise, insisting that he join her for brunch in the morning to discuss ideas. </p><p>It was just going to be a waste of time… </p><p>Taiga still wouldn’t be able to think of something new. The only difference would be that his lack of inspiration will just be outside. </p><p>The next time Taiga opened his eyes, he looked at the time again.</p><p>7:27 am.</p><p>Had he even really slept?</p><p>… Well, he might as well get up.</p><p>He wasn't going to get much more sleep with what time he had left. </p><p>Taiga groaned as he sat up, kicking his sheets off his legs before tossing them off to the side of the bed. His fingers dragged through his deep brown hair before blindly feeling around for his glasses, tapping around his bedside table before remembering that he had left them at his desk, where all the crumpled up papers and scratched out notes and outlines that lead to nothing stared back at him as they had the early morning before. </p><p>He pushed them aside, plucking his glasses from the mess before going to his dresser and digging a shirt from the top drawer. </p><p>As Taiga pulled on his shirt, he thanked his past self for ever putting his photo in his books. </p><p>With no image to attach to his name, he could look as terrible as he wanted without getting a second glance, aside from the few people rude enough to judge him simply by his fashion choice or lack thereof. There were only a few select fans who had seen his face at his very early book signings, but otherwise, he was unknown to the public. </p><p>He tugged on a pair of sweatpants before reaching into his closet to pull a randomly selected hoodie from it. </p><p>It didn't really matter which one.</p><p>They were all black anyways. </p><p>The door rang just as he finished brushing his teeth. </p><p>Right on time. </p><p>If his editor was good at anything, she was excellent at being punctual down to the second, never early or late, to the point where it made Taiga wonder if she had some kind of magic that made her timing so perfect.</p><p>He had changed editors twice before, but neither of them were like her, not that Taiga minded. Her punctuality was his punctuality at this point and Taiga needed it. </p><p>He liked her. She was diligent, hard working and sharp and had unique and insightful feedback that was always useful. The only thing Taiga could criticize was that sometimes, she was a little too casual, but he would choose casual over strict and tight-laced any day. It just meant that Taiga could treat her just as casually back. </p><p>When Taiga sluggishly opened the door, she was already beaming.</p><p>"Good morning!" his editor chimed in her sunny morning voice, her double shot latte already pumping through her veins as Taiga rubbed his tired eyes. "Are you ready to go?"</p><p>Taiga wished he had a drop of that caffeine in his body.</p><p>"I-"</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>Taiga wasn't able to get another word out before she was already pulling him out the door and locking it behind them. </p><p>"Come on, don’t drag your feet. Also are you really wearing that outside?"</p><p>"Well-"</p><p>"Just go to the elevator already."</p><p>Taiga was already imagining himself back in bed as they went down the elevator and into her company car.</p><p>It was going to be a long day, whether he liked it or not.</p><p>At least his editor let him nap as soon as he buckled himself in, but a rough bump in the road jostled him awake. </p><p>Taiga placed his hand over his eyes, blocking out the blinding lights of the city as he stirred. "... Where are we going again?" he asked with a tired croak in his voice, not bothering to fix his slouch in the driver's seat. </p><p>She shot a glance at him, seeing her author finally awake before focusing back onto the road. "It's this new French restaurant that's been super popular lately."</p><p>"Will you sit up? You look miserable."</p><p>Taiga frowned, but listened nonetheless, adjusting in his chair to at least not look like a complete puddle in his seat.</p><p>"I just don't understand why you're so insistent on believing this will help."</p><p>"And I don't understand how you believe you can get new ideas when you're all locked up in that apartment!" she snipped back. "Couldn't you afford to at least open the blinds every so often? Every time I open them for you, you close them back up!"</p><p>"The light hurts my eyes…" Taiga winced as he peeked through his fingers, the daylight too bright even without the city buildings reflecting the sunlight from the clear sky.</p><p>"It hurts <em>because</em> you keep them closed! Your eyes will grow weak if you're always in the dark!" she sighed, her cheery morning buzz gone. "Look, I promise this place will be delicious. Can you at least do it for the food?"</p><p>Taiga couldn't say no to a good meal, though he preferred it in his own home, but he was already in the car, so there was no real point in continuing to protest.</p><p>He dropped his hand into his lap, squinting his eyes to slowly adjust to the day.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"As long as the food is good."</p><p>His editor smiled, satisfied, while Taiga pulled out his phone to at least try to hit some stops on his game application as they drove.</p><p>"Thank you, Kyomoto. You won't regret it."</p><p>It was only about 10 minutes later when Taiga noticed her leaning over the wheel, glaring.</p><p>"There's already a line…" she mumbled as she clicked her tongue. "I thought we would get here early enough to save us from the wait."</p><p>Looking up and out the window, there was indeed a line around the store front and down the alley beside it.</p><p>A line?...  Really?... Just how popular was this place? </p><p>From what Taiga could see from his seat in the car, the queue of people seemed to be primarily formed with girls and women of varying ages, all waiting to eat at this mysterious restaurant.</p><p>… What the hell was this place?...</p><p>"Hey. Get out and go get in line."</p><p>His head snapped towards her as if she had just insulted him, his mouth open in disbelief.</p><p>"In there?... With all of them?" he pointed at the line of women as they slowed down to a stop at the red light. "You're kidding right?"</p><p>She was already unbuckling his seatbelt for him as he spoke. </p><p>"No, I'm not. There's cars waiting behind me so hurry up!"</p><p>Taiga wanted to take back every kind thought he ever had about her as she reached past him to open the passenger door.</p><p>He stumbled out of the car, quickly grabbing his bag from his seat before the door was closed briskly behind him, leaving him alone on the sidewalk as he watched the car drive off as the traffic light turned green.</p><p>Great…</p><p>He didn't need to turn around to know that the girls in line were staring at him. The whispers from behind him were loud and clear.</p><p>His glasses clattered as he shoved the frames up his nose and blew his bangs from his face. </p><p>Well, the line had already seen him get shoved out of a car. There was no reason that joining them in line behind would be any less embarrassing.</p><p>It's not like social standards and queues really mattered to Taiga either way. It wasn't like leaving his apartment building in his pajamas to get junk food from the nearby convenience store was something he didn't do already. </p><p>Not often, anyways.</p><p>At least, this time he was wearing pants he didn't sleep in. </p><p>He pulled out his phone to distract himself, trying to ignore the whispers around him that pointed out how a tall man was standing in line by himself.</p><p>It was fine. It was just stupid gossip. It didn't harm him, it was all just words.</p><p>Who cares.</p><p>It didn't bother him.</p><p>Not one bit…</p><p>5 minutes later, he texted his editor texting her asking where the <em>hell</em> she was in gentler terms. </p><p>He nearly exhaled an exasperated sigh of relief when she finally arrived, diverting the questioning glances away from him and back to their own party or phones now that he had company.</p><p>"Sorry about that. Took a while to find parking." She let out a tired breath as she slipped her phone into her purse. "How long have you been waiting?"</p><p>Taiga shrugged, turning to try to squint through the window of the restaurant behind him. "I don't know… maybe 15 minutes now? Is this place really that worth it?... Wouldn't a family restaurant do just fine?" </p><p>From what he could see past the glare of the glass, the place appeared to be rather small.</p><p>Surely, the limited seating capacity only aided the long wait time. </p><p>"Do you really think you can get inspired by a family restaurant? I brought you here for a reason," she retorted as she peeked down the line. "We're almost at the front anyways."</p><p>"I feel like I could have been more productive at home…" Taiga said, facing his back to the window again to see the disapproval written on her face.</p><p>"Really, Kyomoto?... You haven't written anything in weeks. Whether it's here or in your dark apartment, you're not writing something either way."</p><p>Taiga resisted the scowl that wanted to grow on his lips, knowing well he couldn't argue because she was completely right. </p><p>His mind had no story to tell.</p><p>After a conversation about reviews on his last book and his lack of inspiration, they finally reached the front door. The entrance was set down the side alley, decorated with simple yet elegant flora that wound around the trellis and overhangs along with a line of lights that would undoubtedly illuminate the walkway with a warm yellow glow to welcome new customers in, even at night.</p><p>To none of which Taiga paid much mind to. </p><p>All he could think of was how hungry he was. </p><p>Usually, he started his mornings with a hefty bowl of rice along with whatever side dishes he had left in the fridge, but the time for his breakfast was sacrificed for what he thought would be an easily obtained lunch, leaving his stomach completely empty with his midnight snack long gone.</p><p>Taiga wound his arms tightly around himself, attempting to keep his stomach from growling louder than it should. </p><p>He had already read the menu that was set out in the display by the large frosted glass door enough times to distract himself to the point where it only made his hunger more unbearable as he tried to process the french words. </p><p>"Ahh I see, there's a special today," his editor muttered to herself, reading the chalk sign board propped up on the raised concrete flat of the entryway. "No wonder it's so crowded."</p><p>Taiga resisted groaning.</p><p>"That's great, but just how much longer-"</p><p>His question was cut short when he turned to face towards the entrance just as the front door began to swing open.</p><p>If Taiga had taken a second to blink, the edge of the door would have collided with his forehead. Thankfully, he had just enough consciousness to step back, saving his face from hitting the wooden frame, but his spatial awareness failed him as his heel slipped off the shallow step of the concrete flat.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His muscles tightened as his instincts told him to brace himself for the hard ground.</p><p>What more would he go through today?...</p><p>First, he had to go outside just to get stared at by a bunch of girls and now he was going to collapse to the ground like an uncoordinated idiot in front of all of them?</p><p>This is exactly why he didn't leave his apartment. </p><p>Nothing good ever came from spending time outside.</p><p>He shut his eyes as he waited for the wave of pain to shock through his shoulder and side. </p><p>But instead, there was only a firm tug on his waist.</p><p>Out of all the things that rushed around him in the split seconds of the adrenaline that pounded through his veins was the scent.</p><p>The scent that filled his nose was a mix of clean laundry with varying aromas of different cuisines with only the barest hint of a warm cologne.</p><p>He only noticed the warmth wrapped around his waist and pressed into his chest once his feet were stabilized underneath him again. </p><p>When Taiga's eyes blinked open, he found his vision blinded by a soft white fabric as his head was pulled against a stranger's shoulder. As the warmth pulled away, he was met with dark wavy curls before locking with the eyes of the person who owned them. </p><p>His voice was soft and smooth.</p><p>"Are you alright?"</p><p>Taiga blinked as he placed himself on his own feet, his hands still tucked into his chest as they were when he was caught against him. </p><p>The man was handsome. </p><p>It didn't take a genius to see that. </p><p>His face was sharp and sculpted with a strong jawline and dark alluring eyes that could kill. Even his lips were soft and shapely with a perfectly placed mark at the corner that only captured people's gaze as they studied every single thing on his image that made him attractive. Everything about him was so masterfully created in ways Taiga didn't know were possible. </p><p>He was so handsome to the point where Taiga didn't notice he was only inches away from him until his mind finally caught up, snapping him back into the present. </p><p>Taiga gasped, shoving the man back, making the man stare in surprise as he stepped away, his hand slipping away from Taiga's waist. </p><p>"Uh. Yeah. I'm fine," Taiga said flatly as he adjusted his bag on his shoulder and fixed his glasses.</p><p>He knew the right words that should have followed should have been "thank you" or "sorry", but the awkward feeling the stirred in his chest sealed his lips as the man gave an understanding smile and Taiga's editor asked him if he was okay.</p><p>"So!…How many are in your party today?" the man asked as he held open the offending door.</p><p>His editor answered, cutting through the weird tension that had built up with a courteous smile. </p><p>"Just two."</p><h6></h6><p>"My god, that was amazing." </p><p>"Yeah yeah, enough about that. You've repeated yourself 5 times." </p><p>"I just can't get over it! I knew people were saying that he's good looking, I just didn't think he'd be that hot!"</p><p>Taiga and his editor spoke back and forth in hushed tones over the stylish wooden table they were seated at. </p><p>After she watched the waiter catch Taiga by the waist, she couldn't stop raving about it. </p><p>Taiga had already heard the details about how the man had so expertly anchored himself to the door handle to scoop Taiga into his chest, saving him from potentially cracking his skull against the concrete ground. He didn't need to hear again how any girl would have melted in the waiter's arms if it were her instead of him and he <em>really</em> didn't need to listen to how handsome he was when he smoothly asked if Taiga was okay in his deep smooth voice. </p><p>"I get it, already. Don't talk about how thin his waist is again, I'm tired of hearing it."</p><p>Taiga tapped at his phone, tossing the ball at the monster on the screen as he rested the edge of his glass against his lips, taking a drink of its cold contents. He hoped the water would appease his stomach by only filling it, but it brought him little relief. </p><p>She frowned at him as she rested her chin in her palm. "You know, if you just tried a little, I bet you could clean up really nicely."</p><p>Taiga paused, glancing up at her for a second before focusing back on his game.</p><p>"... Is this a conversation that should be taking place between two adults in a working relationship?..."</p><p>She huffed and began to open her mouth, ready to snap back at him, but when the sound of nearing footsteps came, she quickly straightened her back and smoothed out her hair and brightly smiled at the arrived waiter as if she hadn't just been arguing with her writer. </p><p>Taiga, on the other hand, didn't even bother to look up as his editor was handed a clipboard with the menu, her giving a sugar laced thank you before a tap landed on his shoulder, asking for his attention.</p><p>"Sir?..." the same waiter asked with a courteous smile as he held the clipboard out to him. </p><p>Taiga didn't need it as he had decided what he wanted long ago when he was still starving outside, but he took it, giving it no time as he gave a small tort thanks and looked back down to his phone.</p><p>His editor smiled up at the man, showing him the menu.</p><p>"Do you mind helping me pick?"</p><p>Taiga wanted to groan.</p><p>He had never seen her lay on her flirting so thick ever since she got drunk at their company party and was all over the new transfer employee. It was only worse knowing she was sober.</p><p>The waiter smiled. "Of course." </p><p>Oh boy. Here we go…</p><p>Taiga peeked over his nearly empty glass of water as his phone pinged, noting a successful capture.</p><p>The man had knelt down on one knee to move close to her as he leaned in, using the hand furthest from her to point at the menu in front of them to turn his chest in towards her.</p><p>This guy was smooth. </p><p>He was doing all the things to create a sense of intimacy while maintaining a professional distance. He even did those small things that really struck it out of the park, like just barely brushing his hand against hers and tilting his head down to look up at hers. </p><p>When thinking back on it, Taiga could remember that when he showed them to their table, he subtly asked her if they were there together to which his editor responded with an enthusiastic no. </p><p>The man had even checked to see if she was taken.</p><p>Incredible…</p><p>Taiga listened to the conversation drag on, listening to her pretend she hadn't already read the menu 5 times over and told Taiga exactly what she wanted as she asked about nearly every single item on the list to have the waiter stay longer. </p><p>"They all sound so good!... Hmm, I guess I will take the saumon grille, what do you think?" she smiled sweetly to him as he gave her a warm smile back. </p><p>"That sounds wonderful," he replied smoothly as he took her menu, brushing his fingertips over hers as he slid it from her hand before turning to Taiga.</p><p>"And you?" </p><p>"Oh. This one," Taiga said plainly, immediately shattering the flirtatious mood that had been built up carefully by his editor as he held up the menu to him with little to no grace. </p><p>The man almost laughed at his bluntness.</p><p>"The gratin? Of course." </p><p>When Taiga looked back at his editor after the waiter walked away to put in their order, he was faced with a disapproving and maybe a little bit irritated frown. </p><p>"... What?"</p><p>She glared at him for a few more seconds, hoping he would realize his fault before releasing a heavy sigh.</p><p>"Since this is just a working relationship, I guess that means you should be doing work," she said, expressing her irritation as she opened her purse to take and shove a leather bound notebook and a pen in front of him. "I'm going to go take a phone call outside. You try to write something."</p><p>As she stood up to take her exit outside, Taiga glowered at the notebook and matching pen in front of him. </p><p>What once felt like comrades in his creations, now felt like traitors as they only held and made empty ideas and useless notes, but something was better than nothing as he took them into his hands and flipped past all the scratched out and scribbled over words in his and his editor's handwriting to reach a blank page.  </p><p>He might as well try.</p><p>Taiga sat back and took in a deep breath before letting it out in one slow even stream, bringing himself into the proper mindset as he did many times before. </p><p>He first took in his setting. </p><p>It was easy to understand why his editor had chosen this place to bring him, even asking for a seat near the back next to the bar to let him view the space in its entirety. </p><p>The restaurant was modern but didn't appear sterile like some newer places were. It didn't go overboard with white and solid colors and mixed it with natural textures and deep hues of wood. There was no loud music or dim lighting like a dark moody bar as the glass walls welcomed natural sunlight and had simple elegant pendant lights to lighten the space in the evening. It was comfortable and non-threatening and allowed newcomers to feel like they were already regulars. </p><p>Taiga started to jot down notes anywhere on the page.</p><p>Pristine<br/>
Picturesque<br/>
Comfortable</p><p>They didn't mean anything right now, but on the off chance that it would help develop a world for his writing, it was worthwhile. </p><p>Next was the smell. </p><p>Warm<br/>
Vibrant<br/>
Gentle<br/>
Effervescent<br/>
Hungry </p><p>God, he was hungry… </p><p>Taiga's eyebrows pinched as he scratched out the last note. </p><p>He had to focus, even if his stomach was whining loudly. Maybe he should have ordered a starter at least to keep it silent.</p><p>Taiga moved on. </p><p>He closed his eyes to take in the sounds. </p><p>With his eyes closed, he could now notice the soft classical music that played under the clatter of silverware and idle chatter of the primarily female voices. </p><p>He started to write blindly, not wanting to lose thoughts.</p><p>Intimate<br/>
Lively<br/>
Tri v   i </p><p>His letters scattered as a baritone voice cut through his thoughts, layering over the soft whispers of the other customers.</p><p>"And what would you like, miss?"</p><p>The voice was smooth and deep, laced with suggestion. </p><p>Taiga's eyebrows furrowed. </p><p>Ignore it. </p><p>Focus. </p><p>He released air through his teeth as he tried to immerse himself again, but came to nothing as a sickeningly sweet voice invaded his ears.</p><p>"Hmm~... I wonder~…" the voice said in a sing-song tune. "What do you think, Hokkun?"</p><p>Taiga's eyes slowly cracked open, now completely giving up on recovering his broken focus. </p><p>He had hoped to shoot a glare at the couple, but when he looked over to the waiter and the customer, they were too busy lost in their own world.</p><p>"Hokkun" or whatever his name was leaning over her from behind as she sat at the bar, his hands placed on either side of her, wrapping her in his space as he looked over her shoulder. </p><p>"You don't want to order the usual? You always ponder for so long and always end up changing the same thing," he spoke by her ear.</p><p>She giggled as she turned her head, nearly brushing her painted lips near his neck. Her manicured nails slowly ran up his wrist he had placed beside her before a long nail slipped under the thin gold bracelet he wore, lifting it from his skin and letting it roll down along the back of her fingers, as she spoke into his skin.</p><p>"I want to eat something else."</p><p>At this point, Taiga looked away. </p><p>It felt like he had intruded on something private and intimate even though it was in a public space. </p><p>He scratched down more words.</p><p>"How's it going?"</p><p>Taiga looked up from his notes to see his editor returning to the table, smelling like the Marbolo Blacks she liked to smoke. </p><p>"Well… there's words…" he said, pushing the notebook to her. "Not that they mean anything yet… or at all…" </p><p>She tilted her head as she turned the notes towards her as she began to read them out loud. </p><p>"... Lecherous, adultery, conniving?..." </p><p>"Sorry for the wait, here's your order." </p><p>They both looked up at the waiter, Taiga grabbing the notebook and pen to hide in his lap before he slid their meals on mismatched dinnerware onto the table. </p><p>"Here is the salmon for the lady and the gratin for you, sir," he finished with a smile. </p><p>Taiga couldn't help but lean away as he placed his dish in front of him. </p><p>As his hand reached before him, Taiga's eyes caught on the gold bracelet on wrist, remembering how the girl at the bar slipped her fingers under it and ran her nails on his skin.</p><p>It sent a chill down his spine. </p><p>Taiga mumbled a thank you as he pushed up his glasses while his editor did the same, but with much more sweetness sprinkled in. </p><p>The waiter smiled back at her and gave her a momentary touch on the shoulder. "You're welcome."</p><p>She watched him walk away as Taiga took no time to take his fork and begin to eat. </p><p>Even with his hunger, he could recognize the carefully crafted flavors that were expertly composed into the single dish. As much as his stomach told him to shovel the food into his mouth, he took his time to enjoy the dish and appreciate the care it took to make something so wonderful.</p><p>When he looked up to take a sip of his water, he saw his editor watching the waiter as he wiped down an unoccupied table to prepare for new guests making Taiga scoff and swallow down his drink.</p><p>"You should give up on him," he said, setting down his glass.</p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p>She responded, but didn't take her eyes off of him. </p><p>Taiga wanted to roll his eyes. </p><p>"That guy isn't going to do anything for you. I saw him flirting with another customer. I wouldn't expect anything from him."</p><p>Taiga wasn't trying to mean, he was just trying to be honest. Maybe in the end, his editor's dating life was none of his business, but she had come to his apartment before under the guise of checking on him to smoke and drink her relationship sorrows away, knowing that Taiga wouldn't say anything in response. This wasn't far from the standard they had set between them.</p><p>"Oh, I know."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Taiga had his mouth full of his next bite when he met her eyes. </p><p>"Why do you think only girls come here, just because the food is good?....... You're not following, are you?"</p><p>Taiga swallowed down his food.</p><p>"No. Not at all."</p><p>She sighed as she cut into her salmon. "He flirts with everyone. Every girl in here knows it."</p><p>Taiga raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Everyone?... All of them?"</p><p>"Every single one. While respecting boundaries." </p><p>Yeesh… </p><p>What a nightmare.</p><p>Taiga chuffed a sarcastic laugh and continued to eat as she frowned. </p><p>She pointed her fork at him. "You don't understand that sometimes women can just enjoy the attention, even if it doesn't mean anything. Sometimes it's nice to just feel special."</p><p>Taiga spoke with his mouth half full.</p><p>"Sure. Whatever."</p><p>Her shoulders hunched, defeated, as she finally started her meal, giving up on getting Taiga to empathize. </p><p>"I can't believe you were the one who wrote Sapphire Bloom…"</p><p>"Yeah," Taiga shrugged. </p><p>"Me neither."</p><p>They ate as his editor went through his notes, looking back at ones that were crossed out or circled for later. She read them out to him as Taiga did his best to craft something in his mind, but nothing came to him.</p><p>He stared at the elaborate designs on his empty plate as she read the notes he just wrote earlier before the next page she turned to was empty.</p><p>She sighed as she set the notebook down closed and handed it back to him. "Nothing, huh?"</p><p>Taiga shook his head before rubbing at his eye from under his glasses.</p><p>"Nope… nothing."</p><p>"Well… do you remember how I told you to keep yourself open at 6 pm?" she said as she checked her phone.</p><p>Taiga didn't like where this was going. </p><p>"... Yes… I do…" he said, dragging out his words, hesitantly. </p><p>"The higher-ups told me if you didn't think of something solid today, they asked me to take you into the office so they can try to convince you to write a romance novel."</p><p>Taiga wanted to scream but settled with groaning and hanging his head.</p><p>"... Can't you just tell them that I thought of something?... Just give me another week."</p><p>"You've been saying one more week for the last 3 months… If you didn't already have so many well selling titles under your name, your contracts would have been terminated weeks ago," she spoke frankly as she finished her dish. </p><p>"I'm sorry, Kyomoto. I don't think this outing was useless, but I had hoped it would inspire you more. It would have even been a bonus if it was a romance plot."</p><p>Taiga buried his face in his hands, pushing his glasses up to his forehead, his voice muffled by his palms.</p><p>"What. You thought that waiter would do something for me?" </p><p>"Maybe. It was worth a shot." </p><p>She signaled for the check, the waiter coming only moments later to take their payment, not forgetting to leave a rested hand on the back of her chair for a second too long before taking it away. </p><p>"I'll drop you off at home but I'll come by to pick you back up at 5:20, okay?"</p><p>"Can I say no?"</p><p>"No, Kyomoto. You can't."</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga dropped his body onto his couch as soon as he locked the door behind him, his legs hooked over the armrest with his bag carelessly discarded onto the carpet. </p><p>He groaned loudly as he threw his arms over his eyes and face. </p><p>He knew what this meeting would be. </p><p>He would have to sit in front of the chief editor and listen to him talk at him about how well a romance novel would sell. The chief would show him all the statistics and analytics they had collected showing how there was currently strong interest and there was buzz online on SNS about readers awaiting his next romance piece.</p><p>At this point, Taiga had almost wished they had just asked him to squeeze out one more book for his last series for the cash grab. At least that would have been an easier task.</p><p>Taiga pulled off his glasses before pulling out his phone to check the time, seeing that it was about half to 12, which gave him around 6 hours to change into something more office appropriate.</p><p>He tossed his phone and glasses onto the coffee table.</p><p>That was a problem for 5:00 pm Taiga. Right now, it was none of his business.</p><p>Unfortunately, 5:00 pm Taiga arrived a lot faster than expected when his eyes shot open from the sound of his phone rattling loudly against the glass table.</p><p>He yawned as he sat up to check the message on his phone, rubbing the corner of his mouth on his sleeve.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I bet you fell asleep. I'm leaving now to come get you. I hope you're all ready.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Shit.</p><p>Taiga shot up from the couch to swiftly go through his closet, pulling out a setup outfit with a shirt to go with it to give the impression some effort was made.</p><p>By the time his editor called him downstairs, he had cleaned up well enough to look like a functioning member of society. </p><p>Just so he could be lectured for two hours about how he should try writing a romance novel. </p><p>Taiga filled his responses with "I understand"s and "I'll be sure to think about it"s along with some "I see"s and "I'll keep that in mind"s, all the while knowing he wouldn't be convinced to write a romance story. </p><p>From the frown on the chief editor's face, he knew it too.</p><p>"Kyomoto…" he sighed as he set down his papers, "you write wonderful stories… I'm a fan of your work as well, so I hope you understand that I'm only here to try to make you achieve. Not smother you. I've said enough to try to convince you, but I can't make your hands move for you. Even if you don't write a romance, we will need you to write something… You understand that, right?"</p><p>Taiga pursed his lips as he looked down at the stale gray office table between them.</p><p>"Yeah… I understand."</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room as the chief editor watched Taiga before he leaned back in his chair. </p><p>"... They're giving you 8 more months to turn in a new manuscript." </p><p>Taiga's head turned up to look at him in shock as the other loosened his tie. </p><p>"8 months?"</p><p>"It should have been 8 months a year ago… We've extended it as much as we can. Please believe me, we really tried to get you as long as we possibly could." </p><p>He leaned over the table and passed his papers to Taiga that listed the data he had presented to him earlier.</p><p>"All you have to do is think of something… Anything at all will work as long as there’s some promise... We will be here to help you the best we can."</p><p>All you have to do is think of something.</p><p>All he had to do was just think of something.</p><p>That's it. </p><p>Taiga stared out the window of the car as his editor drove him home, watching the street lights slowly flicker on as they passed by in the darkening sky. </p><p>He had 8 months before they considered terminating his contact…</p><p>It exactly wasn't a lot of time to think of a plot nor even a full manuscript. </p><p>He had to do was think of something.</p><p>Just something that wasn't a goddamn romance novel. </p><p>His editor glanced over at him from the corner of her eye before looking back at the road. Her grip tightened on the wheel before she spoke.</p><p>"Kyomoto… I know it might be difficult but really, I do think you should seriously consider writing-"</p><p>"Let me out of the car."</p><p>"Kyomoto?"</p><p>"Just let me out."</p><p>"We're still about 20 minutes away-"</p><p>"It's fine. I'll walk."</p><p>"But-"</p><p>Taiga sat up in his seat, readying himself to leave the car.</p><p>"You said I need some fresh air, right?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>The car slowly pulled over, allowing Taiga to slip out of the seat and stand on the city street. </p><p>"Kyomoto… I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you upset. I just want to see you write again too…" she said as he went to close the door.</p><p>Taiga's hand tightened on the car door as his chest felt a pang of guilt. He didn't mean to make her feel bad… He knew she was trying her best too. </p><p>The car just suddenly felt suffocating.</p><p>He leaned down to speak through the open door. "No, you did nothing wrong. I just need to let out some steam… and hey, maybe I'll get some inspiration too."</p><p>She gave him a meek smile before nodding her head.</p><p>"Get home safe."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>He shut the door and gave a small wave as she pulled away, blending in with the other red tail lights of the passing cars. </p><p>Taiga took in the cool night air into his lungs before letting it all out in one sharp breath, looking up at the tall city buildings that reached into the night sky.</p><p>He closed his eyes as words filled his head.</p><p>Crisp.</p><p>Soothing.</p><p>Solitary.</p><p>Mindless.</p><p>Helpless…</p><p>Anxious…</p><p>Scared...</p><p>……</p><p>When his eyes opened, he saw the same sky as before. </p><p>… He might as well write it down.</p><p>Taiga opened his bag to look for the same notebook as before, but it proved to be a challenging task in the dark. He continued to search through his bag as he slowly moved towards a building with a light, hoping to get a better view of inside.</p><p>Where was it?... </p><p>He definitely put it in here.</p><p>He absolutely put it back in his bag…</p><p>His mind played in rewind, sending him back to the last time he saw it.</p><p>He remembered taking it from his editor in the restaurant and then-...</p><p>Taiga froze as his memory ended. </p><p>"Um… Excuse me?"</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>By some serendipitous chance, he was in front of the same restaurant with the same waiter, leaning over to fold up the display sign from outside. </p><p>"Did you perhaps forget something?..."</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>"Uh-... Yes, actually..."</p><p>"It was the notebook, right?" The man gave a warm smile as he picked up the sign. </p><p>"Come in. I'll fetch it for you."</p><p>Taiga's eyes followed the man as he made his way down the alley to the front doors, his jaw closing shut once realizing that it had been hanging open. </p><p>There was no reason to not go inside… He had to retrieve his notes one way or another.</p><p>He made quick steps to catch up and take the door that was held open for him. </p><p>The restaurant was completely different at night. </p><p>The windows that once let in bright sunlight were dyed black, only speckled by the reflection of the scattered pendant lights inside. The lighting was of a golden hue, making the wooden furniture appear richer in color. </p><p>His attention was drawn away when he heard a smooth slide of a drawer pull open, finding the man straighten out from behind the bar and place the familiar notebook onto the counter.</p><p>"This is yours, right?..."</p><p>Taiga watched as the waiter's hand smoothed over the top before it was left alone on the cleared table top.</p><p>"Yes… Thank you…" Taiga said softly as he walked to the bar, taking the notebook into his hands. </p><p>"... How did you know-…"</p><p>"That it was yours?" the man replied as he closed the drawer shut. "I pay attention to our customers."</p><p>"It's not often that a man comes in here to write."</p><p>Taiga's eyes dropped down to his notes and its battered pages that had been abused from its rough handling. His thumb traced around the corner of the leather cover that had begun to come undone. </p><p>He guessed that was true. He stood out like a sore thumb amongst the female customers.</p><p>"... I also noticed that you look like you need a drink."</p><p>When Taiga looked up, the man was leaning over the bar towards him, his chin resting in his palm.</p><p>Taiga responded with silence, looking back down to his notes.</p><p>"... Am I wrong?..."</p><p>"... No… You're not."</p><p>"What would you like?"</p><p>Taiga dropped the notebook in his bag.</p><p>"Anything strong."</p><p>The man flashed him a soft smile, even if Taiga hadn't been looking to see it, before leaning back to select a bottle from under the bar. </p><p>He set out a silver embellished glass before filling it with whiskey which Taiga quickly knocked back, tears stinging his eyes as the poison burned down his throat. </p><p>"Another?"</p><p>Taiga nodded as he pushed the glass towards him, his eyes squinting as he fought to settle the fire he placed in his stomach. </p><p>The second went down easier. </p><p>The third, he nursed as the alcohol warmed his body.</p><p>"... So you're writing a romance novel?"</p><p>Taiga grimaced behind his glass.</p><p>"... Where did you hear that?"</p><p>"I told you, I pay attention to my customers."</p><p>"I believe that's called eavesdropping."</p><p>The man laughed.</p><p>"Call it what you will, but a conversation in public will inevitably be heard by some people."</p><p>"Well, you're wrong. I won't be writing romance," Taiga grumbled as he went to fetch his wallet from his bag.</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"'Why not??'" Taiga echoed, irritated. "Isn't 'I don't want to' good enough?"</p><p>The man moved to the cash register to total Taiga's bill. "There must be a reason for 'I don't want to', right?"</p><p>Taiga banged his glass down onto the bar before pointing his finger at the man.</p><p>"Listen-..."</p><p>He stopped, realizing he didn't have a name.</p><p>"Matsumura Hokuto."</p><p>"Listen, Matsumura," Taiga restarted, "I don't get what's so good about romance and love. It's all just a bunch of crap anyways. Why should I be giving half of myself to someone else when I don't know what they're going to do with it? Is being my own person really such a sin?? That's a load of garbage. All of it is just this societal norm that makes people think that they <em>need</em> to have another half. What utter nonsense."</p><p>Taiga took the last gulp of his drink, hissing as it went down. </p><p>"So, I guess it's right to assume those words were about me?"</p><p>Taiga wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Huh? What are you talking about??"</p><p>"Lecherous, adultery and… what was the last one?" Hokuto thought to himself as he waited for the receipt to print.</p><p>"Ah right. Conniving." </p><p>Taiga was only irritated by the twist of guilt in his stomach.</p><p>"That's private property, you know." Taiga bit out his words as he began to quickly go through his wallet. "And can you tell me I'm wrong? You go around and hand yourself out to these girls like candy. Do you have no self worth?? You're making yourself look cheap! Isn't love supposed to be something precious that you give to someone special?"</p><p>"Are you really in the position to say that to me?"</p><p>When Hokuto cut into his rant, Taiga's head snapped towards him, seeing his calm, empty expression as everything in Taiga's mind came to a screeching halt.</p><p>"... What?" </p><p>Hokuto said it again, placing Taiga's check in front of him.</p><p>"Can you really say that to me when you don't understand love yourself?"</p><p>Taiga clenched his jaw. </p><p>He wanted so badly to punch the fucking handsome out of his goddamn face. </p><p>"Thanks for the drink."</p><p>Taiga slapped down his due onto the counter, throwing his bag onto his shoulder before marching towards the exit. </p><p>He didn't have to sit through this. </p><p>Why did he have to listen to what his man had to say? He was just some <em>idiot</em> who threw himself around. </p><p>If there was someone who didn't understand things like love and romance, it was <em>him</em>. </p><p>Taiga reached for the door handle, ready to pry it open and slam it shut behind him, but just as his fingers got to the brass bar, his feet stuttered as he was pulled back. </p><p>Somehow, as his head whipped around, he found himself as close to Hokuto as he had been earlier today. </p><p>But this time they were alone.</p><p>Taiga froze as his eyes locked into his, Hokuto's hand gripped tightly around his forearm where he had pulled him back. </p><p>"W-...what is it-?" Taiga stammered softly, greatly contrasting the venomous voice he had spat at Hokuto earlier.</p><p>He watched as Hokuto's eyes lowered, hooding as his hand ran down Taiga's arm to his hand before holding it out between them, his forehead only centimeters from touching his.</p><p>Taiga's eyes stayed on Hokuto's, his own breath loud in his ears as Hokuto curled his fingers open.</p><p>He flinched when the cold touch of coins place in his palm.</p><p>Words got stuck in his throat as Hokuto's eyes met his again.</p><p>"... Your change, sir."</p><p>Taiga felt a shiver shoot down his spine.</p><p>Whether it was shame or embarrassment, it didn't matter. </p><p>He had to get out of here.</p><p>He had to be anywhere but here. </p><p>The change clattered in his fist as he clutched the coins roughly and tore himself away from Hokuto's grip.</p><p>The door jammed as he threw it open and exited as quickly as he could.</p><p>Taiga didn't look back as he nearly ran down the alley and out to the sidewalk.</p><p>His skin felt disgusting. </p><p>It felt filthy as his body grew hot and his stomach grew ill.</p><p>He would never go back there again. </p><p>He would never talk to this "Matsumura Hokuto" as long as he lived.</p><p>And he would absolutely never <em>ever</em> write a stupid idiotic romance novel.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I finally posted the first chapter!!!</p><p>It's been a long process... This one has been a bit more difficult than my last multi chapter fic so I really hope this one fun. Again, its all almost done in writing aside from the last chapter. I'm not sure if will be posting this one as quickly as the last one because I think I may need more time to edit. Currently my goal is once a week! but we'll see what happens. If anything, I hope to keep it consistent.</p><p>I've mentioned many times before that this is based off of Hokuto's drama Koi Nante, Hoki de Yatte do Suru no? I honestly haven't watched the whole drama yet so I'm not really sure what happens so this is very very loosely based on it. It takes ideas and character roles, but otherwise, I like to believe its mostly unique from the drama. </p><p>I have some other draft fics floating around, but I think this will be my main focus for now. I have been thinking about kyoje lately, but I haven't had any good ideas...</p><p>Anyways, I really hope this is enjoyable. This has been a rough write for me. I feel like I've lost my writer's voice but maybe it's all in my head haha. I'd love to know what you think and where you think the story will go in the future! I love every comment and appreciate the time it takes to leave one!</p><p>If you would like to have chapter updates, previews, questions or just me talking about random things, please feel free to follow my twitter!

  <p>8 months.</p><p>8 months was not a lot of time.</p><p>Especially since Taiga only had 7 of those months left.</p><p>His apartment was an utter mess. Well, at least more of a mess than usual.</p><p>Books had been pulled from his large library without being given the time to be put back, leaving growing stacks and abandoned stories left open as Taiga struggled to find anything that would do as much as spark just the barest bit of inspiration to start writing anything at all. The floor was also spared no mercy as torn up and discarded paper was littered over it, all holding the beginning of a thought that never had an ending. </p><p>The living room stayed a replica of a hurricane disaster as Taiga laid on his back on his couch, pressing the "regenerate" button on the auto plot generator which spit out the most simplistic and tired book ideas he had ever seen on its digital page.</p><p>"Protagonist… A socialite, who used to have a heart of gold… and a secondary character, a secretary, who can see right through people… Plot, it's a satire story about confronting reality. It kicks off in a butcher shop with a New Year's Resolution…" Taiga read to himself, scrolling through the text on his phone he held above him.</p><p>The toothpick he had between his mouth rolled between his teeth as he sighed.</p><p>"You gotta be kidding me…" Taiga mumbled before his phone slipped from his relaxed grip.</p><p>He winced as the black brick fell onto the frames of his glasses, jamming the bridge into his nose before it bounced off his forehead and slipped down beside his head and the couch.</p><p>Taiga stared at the ceiling in disbelief before he dropped his now empty hand onto his chest, not bothering to retrieve his phone as nose and forehead throbbed. </p><p>"That was enough of that then, I guess…"</p><p>He kicked his feet and sat his body up, tossing the overused toothpick into the take out tray on the coffee table that laid amongst the mess of books and papers as his editor stepped out from his room with only more books in her hands.</p><p>She set them on top of the ever growing stack of books, only making the tower rise higher. </p><p>"How's it going?" she asked, brushed the dust from her hands.</p><p>"The same as it has been going the last 10 minutes… And the last 4 weeks," Taiga said, dropping himself against the back of the couch and resting his head back over the top. </p><p>"What about the food? Did you like it?" she asked, gathering a few papers for pointless organization.</p><p>"It was pretty good. Where was it from?"</p><p>"Salut."</p><p>"Then it was terrible."</p><p>His editor frowned as she took his clearly enjoyed take out tray with its spotless interior which contradicted Taiga's words regardless of what he wished to say. "I don't understand what you have against the waiter. He's a nice guy." </p><p>"So, maybe he said a few things a little brashly, but was he really saying anything that wasn't true? You had even said yourself that you don't understand romance. And from what he told me, it sounded like you had attacked him first," she said as she took the garbage to the kitchen.</p><p>Taiga just stared at the ceiling. "What did I say about keeping our conversation appropriate for a working relationship?"</p><p>She roughly chucked the tray into the trash bin under the kitchen sink, shooting Taiga a sharp glare he didn't see. </p><p>"May I remind you that you were the one who called me and said you would never go back there?? You just say that whenever you don't want to talk about something! And if this was just a working relationship, then why am I cleaning after you?!"</p><p>"Alright, fine. I'm sorry," Taiga sighed as he straightened out to hunch over the table once again, taking a crumpled paper ball to smooth it out and read its contents to which he grimaced at and balled it back up, tossing it into the empty loveseat across from him. "Also what do you mean by 'he told you'? How many times do you go back there to flirt with him?"</p><p>"First of all, I can tell you that it was much more enjoyable without your complaining, and second of all, we went on a date."</p><p>"A date-?"</p><p>Taiga nearly fumbled and knocked over a precarious tower of books as he reached over to take one from the top, distracted as his focus was ripped away by the sudden news. He shot to his feet to catch the leaning stack, grabbing the top books that started to slip and stabilizing it before the whole stack fell from the table and spilled across the floor. </p><p>After a huff relief he repeated, "A date?!" as he was unable to fix the displaced glasses on his nose. </p><p>"You went on a date with that guy??" </p><p>His editor rushed over to help with the stack and push them back into the glass table before taking half of the books to make the pile less intimidating. "Yes, we went on a date with him. And his name is Hokuto, mind you." </p><p>Taiga gawked at her as he took the book he originally went to take, no longer paying much mind to its contents. "Didn't I tell you that he plays around?"</p><p>"Yes, and I told you that I'm aware," she replied as she placed the books on the kitchen island.</p><p>"So why??"</p><p>"So why not?"</p><p>Taiga couldn't believe it. </p><p>He had heard enough stories about the men his editor had dated, about how they're scum and disgusting and not worth the ground they walk on. So why was she so ready to date a guy who clearly had no intentions of having any sort of commitment??</p><p>Was this a female thing or had he gone insane??</p><p>"Didn't you say that the next guy you dated had to value you and kiss the ground you walked on?" Taiga blindly opened his book as he watched her dig through her purse.</p><p>"Yes, that's still true."</p><p>"Then why him?? He's not going to give you any of that!" He exclaimed, holding his hand out, simply baffled and confused by her choices as she lit a cigarette under the stove top vent.</p><p>She clicked and twisted the exhaust on, directing the smoke of her cigarette under it as she took a drag of it before speaking, wisps of white leaking from her lips.</p><p>"Because I <em>know</em> he won't give me any of that."</p><p>She tapped the ashes into the tray Taiga brought from his last home and set out for her, not needing to see his face to know that he didn't understand.</p><p>"I'm just having a little fun. I know it's not serious. Every girl that goes out with him knows it's not serious. I'm just sick of being mistreated and Hokuto treats you right, regardless if it means anything or not. I'm just letting myself enjoy him like all the other girls are."</p><p>Taiga's fingers fiddled with corners of the pages as his brain tried desperately to process the information. "How many girls is he going out with?..."</p><p>"I'm not sure. He's never said no to anyone as far as I know. It's probably changing all the time."</p><p>Taiga's mind was invaded by the memory in the restaurant, remembering the sugar coated voice that spoke to that man, heavy with suggestion as it spoke of having an appetite not for food.</p><p>"... How many girls is he sleeping with?..."</p><p>Obviously, there was more than just dates…</p><p>His editor took another breath of her cigarette.</p><p>"Who knows. Girls don't like to kiss and tell, Kyomoto."</p><p>He held back the grimace that wanted to grow on his face.</p><p>Disgusting.</p><p>He felt filthy just thinking about it. </p><p>"I'm going to take a shower." Taiga stood up, setting down the book he never looked at on the coffee table before making his way to his room.</p><p>"Good. We're going out tonight anyway."</p><p>Taiga's feet froze.</p><p>His head slowly turned towards her.</p><p>"... Huh?" </p><p>"You didn't look at your schedule, did you?"</p><p>"It hardly ever has anything on it…"</p><p>She put out her cigarettes in the dish, returning the box to her purse.</p><p>"There's a writers dinner tonight. The company thought it would be mutually beneficial for our authors to meet each other."</p><p>Taiga was already hating it. </p><p>Before he could even ask if he could skip it, his editor cut him off, telling him it would be good for him and waved him away to take his shower and ultimately put on clothes he hardly ever wore to look "nice".</p><p>And when his editor pulled around the block to drop him off, he wanted to scream. </p><p>"I know what you're going to say and yes, I didn't tell you on purpose. I'm off for the night so you have to find your own way home, okay?"</p><p>Why?...</p><p>Why?!</p><p>Why did it have to be this freaking restaurant?!</p><p>Taiga begrudgingly removed himself from the car, holding himself back from slamming the door shut, only giving it a brisk push closed before facing the regrettably familiar glass front with the entrance in the side alleyway. </p><p>He half considered just calling a cab to take him back now, but he knew going home would only bring him back to the same dreaded scenery where he would uselessly burn away his limited time, ending up with less progress than having a free dinner with his fellow colleagues. </p><p>With a reluctant sigh, he made his way to the alley, seeing the small crowd of familiar and less than familiar faces of other authors as well as an editor at the front, waiting outside. </p><p>He must have been the one organizing the dinner…</p><p>"Taiga!"</p><p>Taiga broke his glare at the editor when he heard his name, turning to see a warm smile.</p><p>"Ah, Kochi."</p><p>Kochi waved and broke away from his other conversation to come over to him, his energy as bright and friendly as ever.</p><p>"It's been a little while," Kochi grinned, bringing out a smile from Taiga as he patted his shoulder. "How are things going?"</p><p>Taiga gave a weak laugh. </p><p>"Well… not as good as they could be, but I'm doing what I can."</p><p>Technically, he wasn't lying. </p><p>He was doing everything he could. Even if the results were fruitless.</p><p>"What about you? Still picking up other certifications?" Taiga asked, quickly shifting the subject away from himself.</p><p>Kochi Yugo was also a writer, but not like himself.</p><p>Kochi didn't write novels or stories, but guidebooks and articles for other enthusiasts like him. While Kochi was nowhere close to being the first person who made solo camping popular, his books made the nature immersing hobby attractive and easy to consume. </p><p>Taiga had read a couple himself, though he had no interest in camping at all, but the way Kochi wrote made everything simple and easy for a beginner to learn. The descriptions of the quiet nights under the stars made Taiga think he would just be a tiny bit less resistant if he was asked to go camping, though his answer would still be no in the end. </p><p>Kochi wrote several successful books and guides on solo camping, but soon it evolved to barbecue, hot springs, scuba diving, disaster relief and even sign language.</p><p>Taiga had heard down the chain that the editors were frustrated that he refused to stay with one focus, believing that his fans would lose interest as he continued to write outside of their preferred field, but the books continued to sell. Some of them bought his books to pick up a new hobby or got into the hobby after reading. Some simply just bought the book because they loved his passion and how he put it into his words. </p><p>Kochi was an excellent writer in his own way.</p><p>They first met when they ran into each other at their publisher's office, around when Kochi had finished writing his first guide. His book had been put on sale sometime close to when Taiga finished writing his second. </p><p>Taiga had caught a glimpse of his own book in the bag Kochi was holding, obviously given to him by the company as examples of other works as the same company logo glimmered on their spines.</p><p>Their work introduced them, they exchanged numbers, and the rest was history. </p><p>They both wrote side by side in their respective homes as Taiga enjoyed asking Kochi about his descriptions of sceneries while Kochi liked to get suggestions on his choice of words. </p><p>Kochi was an author who had his friendship and respect.</p><p>His friend laughed. "No, not yet! Still writing about hot springs. There's a lot to visit Beppu alone that will keep me busy for a while. My editor should have sent you my last one, did you receive it?"</p><p>"I think I did. 'Hot Springs and Healing,' right?" Taiga crossed his arms. "I started to read it but it made me want to travel when I have no time for it, so I had to put it down." </p><p>"Well, if our free time ever lines up, let me take you to some! I can promise you I can find a nice place for us," Kochi said, nudging Taiga's arm with his fist.</p><p>Taiga smiled. "I will have to take you up on that."</p><p>He definitely needed some healing, but for the moment, talking to his good friend had been healing enough.</p><p>Maybe with Kochi here, this whole dinner thing wouldn't be as bad as he expected.</p><p>He was beginning to feel optimistic as Kochi perked up, remembering something he had forgotten before he lowered his head, speaking to Taiga in a low tone.</p><p>"Oh… By the way, I should mention that some of the others have been saying that this might be a group date…"</p><p>"People have been noticing that there is a suspiciously even amount of men to women here…"</p><p>Nevermind.</p><p>This would be <em>much</em> worse than he expected. </p><p>The organizing editor waved them all in, letting them know that it was on the company's bill and that everyone could enjoy their dinner as they wished while the last person Taiga wanted to see in the world came to hold open the door. </p><p>Taiga tried to fit Kochi between them, hoping to slip inside without drawing any attention to himself as he entered, but as they reached the door, Kochi instinctively shifted in front of him, allowing Hokuto to bend his head to whisper to him.</p><p>The "welcome back" that Hokuto spoke into his ear sent a crawl up his back with the knowledge that he couldn’t escape his eyes. </p><p>Taiga tried to rub down the goosebumps that formed on his skin as he walked in, only having a few moments to curse Hokuto under his breath before he was struck with the <em>other</em> displeasure of his night.</p><p>They didn't even try to hide that it was a group date.</p><p>The table was set up in one line with seats set up on either side. The men were directed to one and the women sent to the other.</p><p>Was this even allowed?... </p><p>Could his company really set up a blind group date between their writers??</p><p>If this wasn't an HR issue, then he didn't know what else it was.</p><p>Taiga would later learn that he and Kochi were the only ones uninformed as they were added to even out the numbers. It might have been a group date, but it was also a free meal.</p><p>Taiga could already feel his hands begin to sweat, his grip tightening around the straps of his bag as he was led to follow Kochi on one side. </p><p>Kochi looked back at him, giving him a sympathetic smile before putting a hand on Taiga’s back and gently pushing him towards the open seats at the end of the table. </p><p>“Come on, Taiga. Maybe it won’t be that bad.”</p><p>While Taiga usually appreciated Kochi’s positive outlook, he couldn’t disagree more. </p><p>This wasn't going to be good…</p><p>No. </p><p>This was going to be absolutely terrible. </p><p>For many reasons. </p><p>Most of those reasons surrounded the man named Matsumura Hokuto.</p><p>The moment Hokuto came out to hand out the menus, all the women were already swooning over him. </p><p>If Taiga had been here to find a relationship, which he wasn't, it would have been intensely hindered by the man who wouldn't stop flirting with the other half of the table, taking away and interrupting any of the opportunities any of the other guys had to make a move. Not that the irritated mumbling from his side wasn’t just as annoying. </p><p>Taiga was incredibly thankful that he had Kochi between him and the rest of them, otherwise his own irritation would have been doubled. </p><p>He tried his best to distract himself from the flirtatious banter as he stared into his cup, trying to study the deep scarlet color of his wine, rounding the fluid in his glass and watching the legs of the drink retreat down the sides of the glass.</p><p>It was honestly much more interesting than anything either party had to say. </p><p>Hopefully Kochi and the wine would keep him company, at least. </p><p>He lifted the glass to his lips to take a sip, nearly spilling it onto himself as an arm reached over his shoulder to place the menu in front of him, Hokuto speaking in a deep tone that was way too close to him.</p><p>“It’s nice to see you back, Kyomoto.” </p><p>It made Taiga shudder as his grip tightened around the glass, only able to glare at Hokuto for a second to see his teasing smile as he handed a menu to Kochi normally with plenty of personal space between them. </p><p>Taiga wanted to say something. </p><p>He wanted to tell him off and call him a lecherous scumbag to his face before wiping that smirk off his face with his own fist, but before he could even begin contemplating standing up, he felt the chill of eyes on his skin. </p><p>Shit.</p><p>There were only a few things Taiga hated most in the world. </p><p>One of them was <em>"being forced to socialize"</em>. </p><p>Another was <em>"being forced to socialize with women in a dating setting"</em>.</p><p>And after tonight, he would be adding one more to the list. </p><p><em>"Being forced to socialize with women in a dating setting to talk about a man he didn’t like"</em>.</p><p>“Do you know him?” one of the women asked, Taiga vaguely remembering that she wrote children’s books. “You should introduce us!”</p><p>“Are you friends with him? I’m so interested in learning more about him!” another asked eagerly, leaning forward in her chair towards him.</p><p>Taiga gave the best polite smile and laugh he could muster. “Ah. No- We’re not friends. He just returned my notebook to me the other day after I accidentally left it here-”</p><p>“Wow! He’s so kind!” the woman gasped as she smiled at her friend. “He’s just as nice as he looks!” </p><p>The two women giggled and chatted about Hokuto, leaving Taiga to blankly stare off and wish he was just anywhere else than here as Kochi gave his arm a comforting pat.</p><p>At first Taiga thought it was just bad luck and all of this was just a poorly pieced together set of coincidences, with his encounter with Hokuto and the women being ecstatically interested, but when his eyes caught Hokuto at the bar, he figured it out. </p><p>Hokuto was standing there watching him, smiling knowingly as he poured the requested drinks from behind the line of women between them.</p><p>Taiga's body grew hot.</p><p>He did this on purpose… </p><p>Hokuto knew <em>exactly</em> what would happen if he mentioned his name in front of them. </p><p>God<strong>damnit</strong>.</p><p>Taiga fought to not grit his teeth as the women began asking him questions about a man he knew next to nothing about, forcing a friendly smile as he denied any knowledge about the "oh so handsome" and "wonderfully pleasant" goddamn Matsumura Hokuto. </p><p>If Taiga didn’t have a reason to dislike him before, he certainly had a reason now.</p><p>The dinner continued as Hokuto and a waiter he didn’t recognize helped him serve the food, but slowly Hokuto's appearance lessened with the food delivered and the conversations at the table began to warm up, the two sides finally beginning the group date.</p><p>To Taiga's demise, unfortunately.</p><p>Taiga just did what he could to keep his head down, hoping that no one would talk to him. </p><p>For a while, he was able to keep conversation away from himself by dragging Kochi into long strung talks that only involved the two of them and forcefully excluded anyone from joining. It worked wonderfully at first as they caught up and talked about movies and shows they both liked, occupying himself from any other talk, but a huge hole was punched into his plan when Kochi stepped away during dessert, leaving Taiga to escape with nothing except his glass of wine that was kept full.</p><p>Without Kochi beside him, he felt like he had lost his shield in front of a pack of wolves.</p><p>He kept his eyes down and tried to look very invested in his cherry clafoutis, slowly poking at the cherries that came loose from the sweet custard before scraping them up together with his fork to place in his mouth. </p><p>… As much as he hated the place, he really couldn’t rightly say the food was bad despite what he told his editor.</p><p>It irritated him how delicious it was. </p><p>The chicken confit he had for dinner nearly fell off the bone and was wonderfully tender. Even the side vegetables it came with were so amazingly prepared that Taiga would have been satisfied if the chicken had not come with it. </p><p>And the dessert. </p><p>The dessert was just absolutely delectable. </p><p>Though Taiga slowly picked away at it, it wasn't that he didn’t enjoy it. Truthfully, if he had no sense of self restraint, he would have eaten the sensibly sized piece whole, but he took his time, hoping that if he focused completely on his treat, no one would bother him. </p><p>The sweet but tart flavor of the cherries blended perfectly with the creamy texture and taste of the custard it was baked with. The earthy taste of the sliced almonds on top wrapped everything together to make one whole mouth watering experience. </p><p>He did his best to not scrunch his nose in delight with each bite, holding and maintaining a neutral face to pretend he wasn’t enjoying the sweet more than usual.</p><p>Especially in front of the eyes of a certain individual.</p><p>But the cherry clafoutis was only temporary bliss in this hellish night before a woman came and sat in Kochi’s empty seat, sliding in close next to him as Taiga instinctually shifted away, his fork in his mouth as his gaze was pulled from his dessert and over to hers. </p><p>Of course, a dessert couldn't divert attention as well as another person, but Taiga really hoped that it would have done a better job as a cold sweat grew on his skin.</p><p>“You’re Kyomoto Taiga, right?” she said with a painted smile “I just love your books.”</p><p>Taiga's eyes darted away from hers, the end of the fork still pressed against his bottom lip. </p><p>“... O-oh… Um… thank you…” he stammered as he placed it down on his plate. </p><p>From what Taiga could remember, the woman before him was the author of many successful young adult novels. A couple gained such a large following that they had been considered for TV dramas and movies. He believed he may have skimmed one of them before and what he did read was beautifully written, though it wasn't his preferred genre. She was a good author.</p><p>But he also remembered the rumors that she had a brief stint in writing raunchy explicit romance novels. </p><p>The kind of books that put men to shame and made housewives blush.</p><p>And from the way that she smiled at him, Taiga felt like he was going to be swallowed whole. </p><p>Taiga shifted uncomfortably in his chair, knowing his sitting position wasn't going to make this any better.</p><p>Damnit, Kochi… Where in the world did he go?</p><p>"I really loved the fourth volume of your series, Kyomoto, there was quite the twist," she chuckled. "Who knew that the wife would have been hiding the evidence." </p><p>She spoke with a velvet smooth voice as she placed her hand on his thigh, leaning in closer as Taiga continued to lean back, trying to keep a distance between them. </p><p>If he had been a normal functioning male, he would have fallen right into her web, sinking deep into her sultry tone and her tantalizing touch. </p><p>But Taiga wasn't. </p><p>The feeling of her nails on his leg made him feel sick to his stomach.</p><p>"Ah, yes. That one was quite popular wasn't it? It's surprising how popular a female antagonist is. It was already and idea I had but my editor had brought in statistics that showed books with a female villain performed quite well, but when over used, it can be get tired-"</p><p>Taiga rambled as his pulse began to rise. </p><p>Not because he was getting hot under the collar.</p><p>Because he desperately wanted this conversation to end.</p><p>He kept his conversation dry and professional, hoping that it would be a turn off and that she would get the clue. He continued on and on, believing that the longer he talked, the less chances she had to push her advances.</p><p>Taiga never liked flirting. </p><p>It is always uncomfortable. </p><p>Of course, he found value and even enjoyed the verbal battlegrounds of debate and even frequently used it in his own writing, but the salacious banter of courtmanship was a whole different thing. Everything about it made it feel like his skin was covered in a thin layer of filth.</p><p>It was so grimy and disgusting, the way that men would prey on women for sex and women would take advantage of men's inability to not sexualize their bodies. </p><p>All of it was horrible. </p><p>It had always been horrible. </p><p>Even in high school, he hated overhearing his hormonal classmates talk about the other gender or their bodies. Just listening to it was bad enough. </p><p>Being the subject of it was worse. </p><p>A few girls had tried to flirt with him, telling him how smooth his skin was or how his face was so pretty. How tall he was and how thin his fingers were. </p><p>There were a few times a classmate of his had brought him sweets to try to win his appeal to which he felt bad rejecting, only because he knew he had wasted their time. </p><p>He didn't care about girls or relationships.</p><p>All he wanted was to be left alone.</p><p>Taiga continued to talk, reciting statistics and studies he had done for his writing, making it the least sexy conversation he could ever make, just waiting for the moment that she would finally give up and find another man to target.</p><p>But when he felt her hand move up his thigh, he realized that none of it was working.</p><p>Before it moved any higher, he grabbed her wrist maybe just a bit too briskly as he saw her flinch and blink at him. Taiga just chuckled nervously, attempting to not look completely crazy as he set her hand back to her own lap with a pat.</p><p>"Sorry. Um. I'm… getting a call." </p><p>The rest of his dessert would have to wait until later.</p><p>He stood up, bumping his legs against the table, causing the dinnerware and dishes chime and clatter loudly and making the other dinner guests jump and look in his direction.</p><p>Taiga smiled and bowed in apology as he quickly removed himself from the table so he could remove himself from the restaurant, while wishing he could remove himself from this whole block.</p><p>Maybe he had just one too many cups of wine.</p><p>He pulled out his phone from his pocket, seeing the screen empty of notifications or calls as he expected, but unlocked it and began to pretend to busy himself with it as he made his way to the front door, finding it slightly propped open with a simple stopper. </p><p>Taiga could already feel the drifting cool air at his feet, crisp in contrast to the room inside. It must have been common practice in the evenings, allowing the natural air to circulate in and keep the stuffiness of the restaurant low.</p><p>Right now, Taiga needed fresh air more than anything.</p><p>He let out a deep breath as he went to grab the handle, but before he could take it into his hand, he heard a voice followed by another through the opening in the door.</p><p>"I thought you didn't have to work late tonight..." </p><p>The female voice had a playful tune as it hinted at its owner's dissatisfaction. </p><p>"I'm sorry. It was a sudden request for a large party. We really couldn't refuse. You'll forgive me, right?"</p><p>The other voice was deep and smooth, thick with seduction as it spoke.</p><p>It was Hokuto's. Taiga didn't need to see him to know that. At this point, he knew the voice all too well with the amount of times he spoke so closely to him. </p><p>As his hand withdrew the handle, Taiga's mind was caught in a deadlock between if he should stay or leave. </p><p>If he stayed and opened the door, he would be interrupting what seemed to be a very intimate conversation. </p><p>If he left, he would have to return to that dreadful group date.</p><p>Either one was a horrible choice. </p><p>So he stood, trapped in the middle staring at the handle.</p><p>And listened. </p><p>"Hmm…" the woman hummed, followed by a soft chuckle. "What do I get if I forgive you?" </p><p>"Depends… What is it that you want?..."</p><p>Taiga didn't want to look.</p><p>The last thing he wanted to see was Hokuto flirting with another girl. </p><p>He hated watching anyone flirt, especially when it was this sexually loaded, but he especially didn't want to see someone like Hokuto flirting.</p><p>… So then why was he leaning forward?</p><p>Why was he leaning towards the glass door to peek through the crack just to spy on the couple who were teasing each other on the other side?</p><p>Taiga's forehead nearly touched the glass of the door as he moved in, looking through the inches wide space in the door to see a woman's back and Hokuto gazing down at her with a loving smile on his lips.</p><p>It was the same woman as before.</p><p>If Taiga hadn't recognized her by her voice or even her hair, he would have remembered simply from the way her fingers traced up Hokuto's hand to trail along the golden bracelet around his wrist.</p><p>The woman placed her hands on his chest to lean into him as he pulled her close by the waist. Hokuto leaned his head down as she raised her chin up, their lips nearly meeting. </p><p>"You know what I want, Ho~kkun."</p><p>The cutesy nickname played off her tongue as her nails gently dragged down his chest. Hokuto smiled before taking her cheek, the gold chain sliding down his slender wrist, before he kissed her. </p><p>It started soft, but quickly gained momentum as her hands clutched into his white shirt and their lips molded together, her lipstick smudging over his lips as he cradled the back of her neck and leaned deeper into the kiss. Hokuto played with her lips, the red smearing as he caught them between his own. </p><p>When they finally pulled apart, the woman giggled as she pressed her thumb to Hokuto's lip, dragging the rose color across it and down his jaw.</p><p>"The color looks good on you."</p><p>Hokuto watched her eyes as he smiled softly.</p><p>"You look good on me."</p><p>She smiled back and pulled him down to her again by his cheek, bringing their lips together for another kiss. </p><p>Hokuto's eyes closed as they met.</p><p>But when they opened, still deep in the kiss, they looked up.</p><p>Locking with Taiga's through the door. </p><p>All the air Taiga had been holding in left his lungs all at once as if a weight had been dropped in his chest.</p><p>He jolted away from the door, hiding behind the concrete frame as he begged that his eyes were just playing tricks on him and Hokuto hadn't just caught him watching.</p><p>His heart pounded in his throat as his back slid down the wall, bringing him to the ground.</p><p>"I'll meet you in your room, okay?" the woman said from behind the door and out of Taiga's sight.</p><p>"I'm looking forward to it."</p><p>Taiga grasped his chest as his head started to spin. </p><p>He prayed that Hokuto hadn't actually seen him and he hoped Hokuto's lack of his mention meant that he had escaped just in time before he could have been recognized.</p><p>But when Hokuto stepped through the door to look over at him, the color still smeared on his lips, Taiga knew he had been caught. </p><p>"... I didn't see anything," Taiga blatantly lied as he looked away. </p><p>"... You look terrible."</p><p>Jeez, how shallow could this guy get?...</p><p>"I know you saw me, but is that really any reason to throw insults at my appearance?"</p><p>Taiga flinched, his eyes shooting back to him as Hokuto bent over to slide his hand under his bangs to touch his forehead.</p><p>His hand felt cool against his skin.</p><p>"No, that's not what I meant… Just how much did you drink?"</p><p>Now that Hokuto mentioned it, it did look like there were almost two of him.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes to ease his blurring vision, clasping his hands over his mouth after managing to erk out a response. </p><p>"... Too much."</p><p>"Come on, let me help you."</p><p>Hokuto took him by the shoulder, bringing him to the hallway beside the kitchen and sitting him down on top of an empty beer crate out of sight of the livening party. He left him only a moment before returning with a glass of ice water, a cup of tea and the lipstick removed from his skin.</p><p>"Here. I also got you this," Hokuto spoke softly as he squatted down beside him, placing the mug on the crate next to him before setting a dinner roll wrapped in a napkin in Taiga's lap. </p><p>"It won't fix everything, but it should help."</p><p>Taiga didn't want to say thank you. </p><p>The last thing he wanted to be was be indebted to this man, but he knew he couldn't be so petty after Hokuto kept him from collapsing next to the doorway and completely embarrassing himself in front of his colleagues.</p><p>"... Thanks…"</p><p>Hokuto watched, surprised, as Taiga took a drink of his water and tore apart the soft roll. </p><p>He kept himself from laughing as he folded his arms over his knees. </p><p>"... You're welcome."</p><p>Taiga bit into the roll, his eyes still refusing to meet Hokuto's as he broke the bread apart again. "... You read my name from my notebook, didn't you?"</p><p>"Was I not supposed to?... I was looking for a way to contact the owner."</p><p>Taiga almost clicked his tongue. </p><p>"Did you also have to go out with my editor?" Taiga mumbled as he placed another piece of the roll in his mouth, chasing it with the water to wash it down his throat. </p><p>"She's a nice girl. Was I supposed to say no?"</p><p>"What about the girl outside? Is she also just a 'nice girl'?"</p><p>There was a notable pause before Hokuto laughed softly.</p><p>"She's different…"</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>"... She's someone I can't say no to."</p><p>Taiga scoffed into his cup. </p><p>According to his editor, that was all the girls he went out with.</p><p>"Why are you asking? Do you have a crush on your female counterpart?"</p><p>Taiga choked on his water.</p><p>He forced the water down his throat before coughing into his sleeve, his eyes stinging and his nose burning as his chest kicked back the water from his lungs. </p><p>"What??" Taiga finally croaked out. "God, no!"</p><p>"Absolutely, not! She's always so demanding and smokes those cigarettes wherever she goes. She's great to work with but I would never be interested in her." Taiga wiped his mouth on the napkin Hokuto gave him before taking a drink of the tea, unable to appreciate the lemon Hokuto had added as his mind was distracted by the absurd idea of being romantically interested in his editor.</p><p>"Really?… I thought that may have been the reason you were so against talking to the women at your table."</p><p>Taiga gave Hokuto a quick side glare over his mug before looking back at his drink. "... No. That's just because I hate it."</p><p>"I thought I was doing you a favor."</p><p>"No. You were doing me quite a disservice actually."</p><p>Hokuto placed his chin in his palm as he watched Taiga drink his tea, unable to ignore his long lashes as he looked down into his cup.</p><p>He thought for a moment, choosing his words on his tongue before asking.</p><p>"... Is it possible that you're into men?"</p><p>If Hokuto hadn't been quick enough, the mug Taiga had been holding would have smashed across the floor. His arm shot out to catch the cup as it slipped from Taiga's grip, a mere few inches from the floor. </p><p>After Hokuto had recovered the mug, Taiga still stared at him like the handle was still in his fingers, his hands still held up in front of him, frozen.</p><p>Taiga's voice nearly shook.</p><p>He wasn't offended or upset. </p><p>He was just in pure shock.</p><p>"... Huh?..."</p><p>Hokuto didn't hold back from asking again, placing the mug down beside him.</p><p>"... Are you into men?..."</p><p>Taiga's mind was racing as he stammered.</p><p>"... H-... Wh- … W-why would you-?..."</p><p>Hokuto stood up straight and beckoned him with his hand.</p><p>Taiga didn't know what compelled him to follow.</p><p>Maybe it was just utter shock that made his brain malfunction, but he stood and followed Hokuto's hand, moving to the kitchen entrance and looking through the small window Hokuto pointed to.</p><p>For a moment, Taiga wondered if this was all a dream. </p><p>Just all some fucked up nightmare that started from the moment he stepped out the the car.</p><p>Nothing seemed real anymore. </p><p>Nothing made sense anymore. He couldn't understand. </p><p>He couldn't understand how he was watching Kochi kiss a man in the kitchen of this godforsaken restaurant.</p><p>His friend was backed up against one of the steel tables with a man nearly pressed up against his chest. The other had his hands on the table at Kochi's sides, circling him in himself as Kochi looked up and took a kiss from his lips.</p><p>Taiga had never seen Kochi smile like this before and he had seen Kochi win awards for his books. </p><p>He didn't get it.</p><p>He didn't get it all.</p><p>Was love really <em>that</em> good?...</p><p>Taiga nearly jumped out of his skin when the warm breath heated against his ear.</p><p>"Your friend seems to be enjoying it... I wondered if you would too."</p><p>Taiga tried to pull away from the window and away from Hokuto, but was trapped by Hokuto's arm against his shoulder, making him stumble back and his back hit flat against the wall beside the door.</p><p>From the way that Taiga flinched when Hokuto placed his hand against the wall, trapping him between his arms, someone would have thought Hokuto had slammed his fist against it to intimidate him.</p><p>But his movement was smooth, his fingers sliding slowly up the painted wall before spreading out beside Taiga's head as his body leaned in with it. </p><p>Taiga stared into his eyes.</p><p>His head was reeling.</p><p>This time, he couldn't blame the drinks.</p><p>Taiga's feet shifted anxiously, knocking over the cup that he had set aside, neither of them breaking from each other to check it as the glass clattered, spilling its contents as it rolled at their feet.</p><p>Taiga almost recoiled when Hokuto began to speak </p><p>"Tell me, Kyomoto. Have you ever experienced anything with another man?"</p><p>Taiga's mouth opened, but nothing came out.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't. </p><p>When would he have ever done that?</p><p>He had kissed one girl in highschool and that was it. </p><p>He didn't even enjoy it</p><p>So why would he ever even think about doing such a thing with another man?</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t.</p><p>He would never.</p><p>He would never even think about kissing another man.</p><p>Taiga's eyes moved down to Hokuto's lips.</p><p>The lipstick on his lips had been rubbed off since Hokuto came inside, but from this close, Taiga could still see how the red pigment stained his full lips, the traces of the color laid askew over them.</p><p>Taiga's nails dug into the wall behind him as he swallowed hard, watching Hokuto grow closer.</p><p>Watching his lips grow closer.</p><p>"You say you don't understand love, but maybe, you were just never looking at the right person."</p><p>His head felt worse than when he was drunk. His body was hot and his head was pounding with his heart as shakey breathes huffed from his chest.</p><p>It made him feel sick. </p><p>Taiga closed his eyes tight.</p><p>It almost made it worse.</p><p>If he couldn't see it, he could feel it. He could feel how the air grew tighter as Hokuto moved in.</p><p>He swore he could almost feel a breath against his lips.</p><p>"... Your face is completely red."</p><p>Taiga's eyes shot open to see that Hokuto had moved away.</p><p>Taiga couldn't see it, but his own face was completely flushed up to his ears. </p><p>And when Hokuto chuckled in his throat with a knowing smile on his lips, the burn in his cheeks only got worse.</p><p>"Were you possibly waiting for something?..."</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fuck!!!</p><p>God-<strong>fucking</strong>-damnit!!!!!!!</p><p>Taiga didn't look back after shoving Hokuto back.</p><p>Taiga didn't care how he looked when he sped towards the table to grab his bag. </p><p>He didn't care how much the others judged him for leaving without saying goodbye. </p><p>Taiga threw open the door and walked and kept walking further and further away until he saw a cab. </p><p>He yanked the door shut behind him after getting in, not making eye contact with the driver as he slid into the back seat and told him his home address.</p><p>As the cab took him home, Taiga propped his head on the head rest as he tried to watch the city pass by outside his window, the lights and signs flowing past before he covered his face with his hands.</p><p>He hated the image that reflected back at him in the dark window. </p><p>He hated how his cheeks were pink and his eyes looked like they were wandering to look for more. </p><p>If he wasn't in a cab he would have screamed. </p><p>He just wanted to be home.</p><p>He wanted to be home amongst his half read books and unfinished ideas. </p><p>Even if all those stories were half baked, anything was better than the thoughts that stirred in his head. </p><p>Anything was better than thinking about him.</p><h6></h6><p>Hokuto stumbled backwards, barely staying on his feet after Taiga had shoved him back and broke free of his arms. </p><p>He stood silently as he watched him rush to the table, clutching his bag tight in his fist before barging through the front door, the party he left behind left in silence before the chatter started slowly before building back to right where it was before.</p><p>The door slowly closed behind him, only giving Hokuto a sliver of the view of Taiga's back before it disappeared from his sight.</p><p>His bewildered expression softened, letting out a single silent laugh under his breath before he pressed his lips together, smothering the smile that tempted them. </p><p>"What the hell was that all about?" </p><p>Shintaro walked up to him, leaning over to see if he could see the customer that charged out through the windows.</p><p>"Don't worry about it," Hokuto said, pushing Shintaro's shoulder to swivel him back towards the restaurant. "Did you check on all the guests?"</p><p>Shintaro frowned, unsatisfied with Hokuto's answer, but chose to prioritize their work.</p><p>"Yeah, I did. They're all about wrapped up though. Just chatting the night away."</p><p>"Alright. I'll go handle the check. You go tell Jesse to stop making out with one of our patrons." Hokuto pushed Shintaro towards the kitchen door as he walked towards the register. </p><p>Shintaro's feet stuttered as he looked back at Hokuto in shock and confusion, but understood once he peeked through the kitchen door, knocking on it loudly to break Jesse and the customer from their fantasy world. </p><p>Hokuto punched the items into the register, smiling as he handed it to the party organizer that came up to him, giving him the company card. About half an hour later, the man who paid told the group that the place was closing, getting a mixed reply of disappointed groans and relieved sighs.</p><p>Hokuto went to hold open the door, some leaving in pairs and others who gave him lingering glances or a touch on his arm which he replied with a gentle smile. </p><p>The stranger in their kitchen left with an apology and a bow a few minutes later.</p><p>After setting back the tables and chairs, Shintaro scurried off with just as much energy as he arrived with, running to catch the next train. Jesse came out from the kitchen, leaving it spotless as he always did, smiling at his phone with his bag on his shoulder and waving Hokuto goodbye.</p><p>Then the store was finally silent.</p><p>Hokuto was left alone to do the rest.</p><p>He didn't mind though.</p><p>The other two had a commute home and Hokuto enjoyed the moment of peace as he tallied the register and returned the last few glasses back to their place behind the bar as he played his own music softly over the speakers.</p><p>As he set the last glass down, his hand paused on its stem as the spot that was always occupied beside it remained vacant.</p><p>He stared at the open space before he finally remembered.</p><p>When he went out of the bar to look down the hall next to the kitchen, he found what he was looking for.</p><p>The glass chimed softly against the wood floor as Hokuto bent down to rescue it along with the half empty cup of tea that had long gone cold, putting both into the bar sink as Hokuto turned on the faucet to clean them, finding it pointless to use the industrial washer to clean two items. </p><p>As the glass filled and Hokuto covered it in suds, he remembered his face.</p><p>His skin was pale. </p><p>Hokuto didn't think any more color could have been gone from his face, but he was wrong. His eyes had been glazed over from the alcohol taking its toll and his forehead was hot to the touch. </p><p>He set the glass to the side to dry as he let water spill over the top of the mug before emptying its contents.</p><p>Those heavy frames hung on his nose, but past them, he could see the long lashes that decorated his sharp eyes. From all the girls he had gone out with, Hokuto had seen many gazes and how they loved to fill and darken them, or even extend them with false ones.</p><p>Hokuto felt like he wouldn't need them.</p><p>He wondered what they would have looked like if he had taken those glasses off from his nose. </p><p>He rinsed the soap from the mug, setting it next to the glass on top of the towel he had set on the counter.</p><p>Hokuto hung up his apron and took the keys from his pocket after he stepped outside to lock the door behind him.</p><p>The man had stared at his lips when he leaned in, his porcelain skin turning red as he grew closer. He had squeezed his eyes shut, almost trembling as he expected something to come next. </p><p>Hokuto never intended to get that close, nearly feeling the heat from his skin.</p><p>But it tempted him.</p><p>Hokuto wondered.</p><p>Hokuto turned the handle of his room above the restaurant, knowing that it would already be unlocked.</p><p>She smiled at him, her legs crossed as she sat patiently on his bed.</p><p>"I've been waiting for you, Hokkun."</p><p>"Did you miss me?" she asked as she approached him, placing her hands on his chest before they traveled up to snake around his neck.</p><p>Hokuto closed the door, twisting the latch to lock it behind him. </p><p>Hokuto smiled as he kissed her.</p><p>He wondered.</p><p>He wondered what would have happened if he had closed those last few centimeters between their lips.</p><p>"I've been thinking about you the whole time."</p>

  <p>Maybe some would say that choosing to forget everything that could pertain to self discovery was unhealthy.</p><p>But Taiga wasn't exactly the healthiest person anyway.</p><p>As soon as he burst through his door, he threw his bag on his couch and started stripping off his clothes, not caring where they landed before getting into the shower where he scrubbed his body hard with soap.</p><p>He knew that it wouldn't help. All the water and soap in the world wouldn't rid him of the grimy feeling on his skin, but it at least let him believe that it did something, even if all the filth was inside. </p><p>He ruffled his hair dry, his dark locks still damp as he tugged on his pajamas and curled up in bed, where he willed himself to forget everything that happened for the sake of his own sanity.</p><p>Do you know how fast time passes when you're trying to forget something?</p><p>Turns out, it's very fast.</p><p>By the time Taiga decided it was about time to stop watching his favorite shows on repeat and lying to his editor to start trying to work again, two more weeks had been lost off of his deadline. </p><p>Taiga blamed Hokuto for plaguing his mind with garbage that was anything besides his work. </p><p>… Not that his brain even had anything that pertained to work, but that was beside the point. </p><p>Taiga frowned at the calendar his editor gave him to track his days.</p><p>During the last two weeks, his head could hardly handle anything except distractions. Before the stupid surprise group date, he had diligently crossed off each day as they passed, but after a long period of neglect, it left Taiga to draw a thick dark line through the last pair of rows.</p><p>He sighed as he tossed the marker, the plastic case clattering as it skittered over the counter while Taiga dropped himself down on his couch, the mess of books that were left untouched surrounding him. </p><p>The room was dead quiet as he sat alone, his morning just starting after he finally dragged himself out of his bed. </p><p>As the silence dragged on, a sort of numbness began to take him over as his mind was left completely empty. It was like his inner ear only had a soft static as he stared over the mess. </p><p>… This wasn't working...</p><p>He had to do something…</p><p>Taiga rubbed his eyes before standing up and pulling off his shirt from his back. </p><p>Anything was better than nothing.</p><p>He changed out of his pajamas and put something on that was different, just something he couldn't fall asleep in before turning on his computer.</p><p>And as soon as his text program opened, he started writing.</p><p>Just anything.</p><p>It didn't matter.</p><p>It didn't matter if it made sense or if it had any flow or eventual plot. He just wrote words. </p><p>Images he saw. Things he felt. His reaction when he watched the finale of SPEK for the 10th time. Words. </p><p>Just words. </p><p>It was probably all useless. Just a complete mess of words, but it felt good to write something without pausing to think if it was anything worthwhile.</p><p>His hands only stopped when his phone buzzed. </p><p>Taiga pushed his glasses up onto his head as he took his phone to check the message.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Kochi:<br/>
<em>Hey. I'm outside. Mind if I come in?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga raised an eyebrow.</p><p>It was rare for Kochi to come over. </p><p>It was especially rare for Kochi to come over unannounced.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga:<br/>
<em>Yeah. Let me buzz you in.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>After a couple of minutes, there was a knock on the door to which Taiga went to promptly answer.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>"Hey!" Kochi smiled, lifting a hand in greeting. "Sorry to come over on such short notice. Well, I didn't give any notice, really…… Wow… it is a mess in here…"</p><p>Taiga turned to face him after leaving the door open to let him inside, seeing Kochi looking over the clutter of books and papers that filled his living room.</p><p>"Uh… Just ignore that. Come over here, it's cleaner. Do you want something to drink?" Taiga asked as he walked to his kitchen.</p><p>Kochi scanned over the room in awe as he removed his shoes. "Sure… Do you have any coffee? Water is just fine if that's too much trouble"</p><p>"If you don't mind it being a little old, I have some left from earlier."</p><p>"That's just fine."</p><p>Taiga pulled a mug from the shelf before pouring the coffee from its pot, the black drink still hot and steaming from being kept warm on its hot plate.</p><p>"Milk? Sugar?"</p><p>"Just sugar. Thanks."</p><p>Taiga set the mug down on the kitchen island, stacking and pushing some scattered books and notes aside to make room for Kochi to sit at before he grabbed and slid the sugar tin next to the mug and went to fill his kettle with water. </p><p>Kochi nodded a thank you as he settled in the vacated portion of the counter, pouring a small scoop of sugar into his drink and stirring it in with the spoon Taiga had placed beside it.</p><p>"You weren't kidding about your block, huh?" He muttered as he wiped his spoon on the edge of his mug before taking a sip, glancing over at the scratchy notes scrawled over one of the many papers.</p><p>Taiga just watched the water rising through the top of his kettle. "Well, I certainly didn't make this whole mess just for looks…"</p><p>"Any progress?"</p><p>"No… not really."</p><p>The stove clicked on and released its blue flame as Taiga set the pot on top of it, flipping the lid shut.</p><p>"Well if it's any help at all, I brought the books we were talking about a couple weeks ago. If I had seen all this before, I would have thought that more books was the last thing you needed." </p><p>Kochi pulled the books from his bag, setting them on the dark colored counter in the limited space Taiga had made available.</p><p>When the books were placed out, Taiga moved from the stove, placing his prepped teapot aside to take and turn their covers towards himself with a smile. </p><p>The books were wide and titled modestly with a simple text to allow the photo printed on the front to tell the rest of the story.</p><p>"No, these are great. I don't have any photo books so this is helpful."</p><p>"I'm glad. I hope they come of use," Kochi chuckled.</p><p>As Taiga looked through his books, Kochi's nail tapped against the side of his mug, the clinking of the ceramic layering with the slow simmering of the kettle on the fire.</p><p>"Hey… So… I have a favor to ask…"</p><p>Taiga didn't pay much mind to the way Kochi nervously fidgeted with his mug as he flipped through the wide images of landscapes, filled with astonishing greenery and patterns of the sky.</p><p>"Mhm?"</p><p>"So-"</p><p>The kettle whistled, the sound piercing through the room as Taiga stared at his friend in shock.</p><p>He wasn't sure if he heard him right. </p><p>He hoped he hadn't heard him right. </p><p>He prayed that the screeching kettle had just messed up his ears.</p><p>The kettle continued to scream for his attention as Kochi simpered and took another drink of his coffee.</p><p>Taiga turned away, his eyes being the last to break from Kochi to turn the flame off, the whistle slowing and dropping the room into complete silence.</p><p>When Taiga faced Kochi again, his hands were pressed flat against each other in front of his face, begging Taiga to listen and for forgiveness.</p><p>There was absolutely no way Kochi asked him to go on a double date…</p><p>"Please, Taiga… I really like this guy… He's just too nervous to meet alone. I'm begging you."</p><p>Taiga had never been so disappointed to be wrong.</p><p>"Kochi. You know how I feel about this kind of thing."</p><p>Kochi hid himself behind his interlaced fingers and begged again. "I know, I know! It doesn't have to be a double date. Just one date and two friends."</p><p>Taiga exhaled sharply as he poured the kettle into his pot, the leaves releasing their color into the clear water before being covered by the lid.</p><p>"You understand that this doesn't benefit me in any way, right? If anything, it's actually a huge inconvenience. I don't have time to waste."</p><p>As Taiga tipped the pot, hot water nearly spilled from the top as he aggressively poured the tea into his mug, over shooting the angle he needed in his frustration.</p><p>"I understand!" Kochi sighed as he dropped his hands back down to his mug. "I know this is asking a lot of you… but please, Taiga. You're not getting much done right now anyways, maybe this will help boost your ideas."</p><p>Taiga scowled as he sipped his drink.</p><p>He had heard this story before… just from someone else and to somewhere else. </p><p>"I'm sorry, Kochi. I really just can't-"</p><p>"Just once. It could even be good for you."</p><p>"Kochi, I really don't-"</p><p>"I wouldn't be asking like this if I wasn't serious about this."</p><p>"I know, but-"</p><p>"I won't ask for anything like this again."</p><p>"Sure, but I just-"</p><p>"I won't proofread your work anymore."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>When Taiga turned back around to face him, Kochi's eyes were locked into his. </p><p>"I've always helped you proofread your work even when I had my own work to do. Do you know how many times I put aside my own writing to help you? If you don't help me this one time, I'll never help you again."</p><p>Not even the hot cup in Taiga's hand was as scalding as Kochi's words. </p><p>Kochi had gone out of his way to help him many times. </p><p>It's not that Taiga didn't trust the editors. They had a plethora of experience reading other works and always had useful advice, but there were just some things that Kochi would say that the editors wouldn't. Taiga most often asked for his help when he was completely lost with a chapter or section of his writing and at these times, Taiga always found that Kochi was able to provide the string he needed to stitch the gaps together.</p><p>His friend had done so much for him that Taiga was always thankful for, but he never considered how much it kept Kochi from his own work. </p><p>Kochi had every right to revoke Taiga's privileges after all he had done if he refused the one favor that Kochi rarely asked for. </p><p>Just thinking about not having that support from Kochi to help with his future works made his blood pressure rise.</p><p>Taiga sat across from Kochi, losing their staring match as he looked down into his cup, wanting to drown in it.</p><p>"... When is it?..."</p><p>Kochi had a bright satisfied smile as he set down his half empty mug.</p><p>"Today."</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga didn't think there could have been a train seat more uncomfortable as he kept his bag clutched in his arms.</p><p>After being told that the date was today, Kochi had taken Taiga's shock as an opportunity to drag him to his bedroom to find him an outfit that appeared at least 20% more put together than he usually did. </p><p>Meaning that Taiga had to wear something besides sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt.</p><p>His legs already felt so restrained… </p><p>He really hated wearing anything that didn't give his legs at least some breathing room. Of course, he had pants that were suited for proper occasions, but he never enjoyed the feeling and never wore them by choice and not demand. </p><p>Taiga held back his grimace as he looked down at his lap and at the pants that felt like they were strangling his legs. </p><p>Kochi had picked out something decently presentable within the constraints of his closet. There wasn't much to work with, but Kochi managed to find a pair of jeans and a top to layer over his t-shirt that made him look a little more human than usual. </p><p>"Remind me why I had to change again?" Taiga murmured. "I'm not the one on a date."</p><p>Kochi tapped at his phone. "I told you, it ruins the setting. Having my friend show up looking like a slob isn't exactly romantic."</p><p>Taiga would have preferred it that way.</p><p>The less romantic, the better.</p><p>Taiga raised his head to watch the scenery whip by as they regrettably grew closer to their destination.</p><p>"So why did you ask me?... Was there no one else you could have asked?"</p><p>Kochi sent his message, smiling at the response he quickly received back. "You were the only person I knew I could convince to come last minute."</p><p>"You basically forced me…"</p><p>"Exactly. And I don't regret it."</p><p>Taiga wanted to take back every single nice thing he had ever said or thought about Kochi Yugo. </p><p>He was a terrible friend. He was the worst friend anyone could ever have. He didn't appreciate everything he had ever done for him or find him an incredibly valuable person in his life. Kochi was the worst friend ever.</p><p>Kochi laughed lightly when he noticed Taiga's lifeless eyes and put his hand on his arm. </p><p>"I really appreciate it, Taiga… I'm extremely thankful that you agreed to come. Trust me, I know all of this is kind of a sore topic for you so it really makes me happy that you're doing this for me. I owe you everything, regardless if things work out or not."</p><p>Taiga placed his hand over Kochi's, holding it for a second before brushing it off of him. </p><p>This is why Taiga considered Kochi to be his best friend. </p><p>Even if there were times when Kochi picked on him and made fun of him, he was always sincere and genuine during all the others. </p><p>Kochi smiled as Taiga pushed his hand away, knowing that Taiga would eventually forgive him, even if he didn't want to at the moment. </p><p>"If I survive writing this next book, I'm going to hold you to that."</p><p>"Sure," Kochi laughed as he settled back in his seat. "I'll help you as much as I can."</p><p>"Also if it makes you feel any better, Jesse told me his friend might know you, so he won't be a complete stranger."</p><p>Taiga hummed in response as his mind became distracted by the landscape, watching the way the waves in the water blended the reflection of the clouds in the blue sky. </p><p>He didn't think about what Kochi had said until they stepped off the train. Once Taiga had finished staring out the window, he was distracted by realization that he had missed collecting stops on his phone app as he quickly went to grab it to collect what was left, not paying any mind to what Kochi's words implied.</p><p>And when they did step off the train, Kochi's words caught up to him as he saw the person he could recognize as the man who had been locking lips with Kochi in the kitchen weeks before.</p><p>If the world was a comedy TV show, there would have been a record scratch as Taiga's brain played a game of word association in double time.</p><p>Kochi.</p><p>Jesse. </p><p>Kissing. </p><p>Kitchen.</p><p>Restaurant.</p><p>Salut.</p><p>Friend.</p><p>Jesse's friend.</p><p>Jesse's friend that knows him.</p><p>Taiga's mind landed on the answer at the same time as he saw the perfectly waved hair of the man standing next to who he believed to be "Jesse".</p><p>Before Taiga could even consider stepping back onto the train, Kochi put his hand firmly on the center of his back, pushing Taiga forward and foiling his plans of escape before they were even made.</p><p>Damnit. </p><p><em><strong>Damnit</strong></em>!!</p><p>"Kochi!" Jesse smiled brightly as he stepped away from the pillar he had been waiting by. "Was your trip long?"</p><p>"Hey! No, it wasn't that bad, it was just sitting on the train. Did you wait long?" Kochi asked as his hand stayed set on Taiga's back, moving him towards the other pair.</p><p>Just the voice Kochi used made Taiga cringe. </p><p>Out of all the years he had known Kochi, not once had he ever heard him use this kind of tone. </p><p>Kochi was cheerful, but not this sickeningly sweet.</p><p>"We only got here a few minutes ago," Jesse grinned. </p><p>"It's um… it's nice to see you again, Kochi."</p><p>"I'm happy to see you too, Jesse."</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>It had only been a few seconds and Taiga already felt sick.</p><p>"You look nice today."</p><p>Taiga nearly tripped forward over his own feet when the familiar voice spoke close to him.</p><p>He slapped his hand over his ear that still had a crawling over it as he straightened out his feet from under him.</p><p>Taiga never wanted to meet this man's eyes again. He would have preferred to stare down a hungry lion before looking into his. </p><p>Yet, there he was. Standing in front of him with that disgustingly charming smile. </p><p>The squeak of Taiga's shoes scuffing against the polished station floor broke Jesse and Kochi from their tiny world as they looked over to them, finding Taiga uncomfortably adjusting his glasses as Hokuto stood quietly as if nothing had happened.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry! Kochi, this is Matsumura Hokuto," Jesse said as he gestured towards his friend who gave a courteous bow and reached out his hand. "He's the waiter at Salut if you remember."</p><p>"It's nice to meet you again," Hokuto said with a friendly exposition as he shook Kochi's hand. "I've already heard a lot about you from Jesse." </p><p>Jesse coughed before laughing nervously, disrupting Hokuto from saying anything further. "Right! And um- you are?"</p><p>Taiga was too focused on trying to think of a way he could escape back home to notice the three of them looking at him. </p><p>What if he said he was sick? </p><p>But it had to be bad enough for a reason to go home. A cold wouldn't do it. The flu? No, Kochi had been with him this morning though, it wasn't convincing. Maybe food poisoning. Food poisoning could happen abruptly enough to be believable-</p><p>Only Kochi's elbow into his side brought him back from his thoughts to notice Jesse looking at him, waiting for an answer.</p><p>"Sorry, you know I um-..." </p><p>Taiga started his excuse, hoping they would believe him enough to let him get back on the train home, but the glare Kochi gave him was louder than any of his internal monologue.</p><p>A glare that yelled "Don't fuck this up for me."</p><p>Taiga laughed awkwardly, submitting to Kochi's silent demand as he looked back up at Jesse. </p><p>"I was uh… just thinking about how much fun today will be. I'm Kyomoto Taiga." He forced his best smile as he held out his hand for Jesse to take. "I assume you're Jesse."</p><p>"That's right," Jesse beamed as he shook his hand. "Hokuto told me that you two know each other?"</p><p>Taiga sure wished he hadn't. </p><p>"Not that closely," he said in his public facing voice. "He just gave me back the notebook that I had left at the restaurant once. That's all." </p><p>That was all. </p><p>As long as you ignored all the other times Hokuto had gotten unnecessarily close to him. </p><p>There was a palpable uncomfortable energy between him and Hokuto. It didn't take a genius to notice that they weren't nearly as acquainted as Hokuto may have implied. </p><p>But for Kochi's sake, Taiga did his best to pretend he didn't prefer to be anywhere else but here. </p><p>Taiga forced another smile.</p><p>"Shall we go?"</p><h6></h6><p>The date was going as expected. </p><p>As in, it was just as painful as Taiga had expected it to be.</p><p>The chosen location was an amusement park. It was almost laughable how contrasted his inner emotions were to his surroundings, decorated in bright colors and cheerful shapes to invigorate a child like glee. Taiga fought back the scowl that attempted to show on his face as the sounds of children's laughter and excited screams echoed around them.</p><p>Wasn't it kind of strange for a group of working adult men to be going to an amusement park together?... Just visually, their group was strange as they stood feet above the children who ran past their feet. It only added to Taiga's discomfort as they got glances from questioning mothers and judgmental teens. </p><p>Yet, Kochi and Jesse didn't seem to mind one bit. </p><p>The two of them were completely lost in their own bliss as they chatted between them. Their conversation rarely stopped with Jesse always ready to fill the space, but even in their brief silences, there was something between them, be it the bumping of arms or an exchange of smiles. </p><p>The subtle hints of their flirting never stopped, even as they stood in line for rides or browsed the various stores. </p><p>Taiga wanted Kochi to be happy. </p><p>Really. </p><p>He wasn't cold enough to ruin today just for his own sake when Kochi was having such a good time. </p><p>He just wished it didn't have to be right in front of him. </p><p>Due to the "double date" Taiga could never be far from their mushy interactions. They were always stood in front of him, Kochi grinning as Jesse blushed ear to ear. Every moment they had, Taiga was forced to witness, no matter how hard he tried to distract himself from them. </p><p>And if he didn't see it, he always heard it. </p><p>Taiga didn't get it. </p><p>He didn't understand how just a bumping of elbows or a grazing of hands was enough to make someone giggle like a child.</p><p>He didn't get what it was about just hearing "I like your necklace" or "your hair looks nice" made someone smile that big.</p><p>No matter what they were doing, they never lost the chance to indulge themselves with each other. Even when they were simply passing trash to have the other toss it in the garbage can they were closest to, their hands would linger just a hint longer than a normal human would. </p><p>It was absolutely nauseating… It was almost like watching two hormonal teenagers interact with the opposite gender for the first time. </p><p>Even then, maybe the teens would have been more palatable to watch. </p><p>At least then it would be excusable. Seeing two adult men instead was nearly unbearable. </p><p>Taiga sighed to himself after growing tired of staring at the unnaturally manicured lake. He turned away from it to lean his back against the metal railing he had been looking over as his sight was once again filled by the swarming crowd that passed through the park.</p><p>He was taking every second of his momentary reprise to heal himself. </p><p>Jesse had offered to buy Kochi a drink. After the playful back and forth of rejection and insistence, Kochi finally agreed to let Jesse get the drink alone to let Kochi rest while he waited. </p><p>Taiga would have been bothered by Jesse's lack of an offer to him if he hadn't been so ecstatic to let his feet rest from the constant walking. It was also like a breath of fresh air to his ears to not hear the flirtatious banter for just a moment.</p><p>He sank down on the metal bars, his feet slipping forward as he sat down on the small concrete curb. Instantly, the soles of his feet began to sting and tingle as the consequence of them being long unused in excess. </p><p>"Do your feet hurt?" Kochi asked as he sat down beside him. </p><p>"Only a little," Taiga mumbled as he stared at his feet that throbbed in protest to his lie. </p><p>Kochi laughed as the sounds of music and children's joy surrounded them softly. </p><p>They quietly sat together for a moment as they both settled into their surroundings, letting their bodies rest with the cool breeze and warm sun on their backs. </p><p>"... I can tell you're not having fun," Kochi said softly.</p><p>Taiga gently tapped the toes of his shoes together.</p><p>"... You can tell?"</p><p>He was less surprised that Kochi could tell that he was pretending to have fun, but more so that Kochi had even paid attention to him enough to have noticed. </p><p>He had assumed that Kochi would have been too caught up with being with Jesse to have bothered to pay any mind to his discomfort.</p><p>Kochi smiled apologetically as he nodded. "Even if this wasn't a 'double date,' I know this isn't exactly on the top of your list of things you like to do."</p><p>"But that's why I'm so thankful that you agreed to come, even though I may have forced you a bit."</p><p>Taiga looked over at Kochi who was rolling a blade of grass he had plucked from the lawn behind them between his fingers. A warm smile grew on Kochi's lips when he turned to meet Taiga's eyes. </p><p>"Thank you, Taiga. I really mean it."</p><p>The rattling of the roller coaster rumbled behind them, followed by the loud splash from the wave the coaster made as it zoomed by as Taiga stared at him blankly.</p><p>… He just didn't get it. </p><p>How did someone impact someone else so intensely?</p><p>What was so good about Jesse that Kochi would thank him so wholeheartedly just because he came to third wheel this stupid date? </p><p>Was this happiness so unachievable by yourself?...</p><p>By nature, animals are meant to mate. Instinctually, they find attraction in genes that are more opposite to themselves in hopes that their next breed will have stronger chances of survival. Romance was just a side product. </p><p>Romance was just made to make it pleasurable in the same way sex was made enjoyable to encourage the agony of childbirth. </p><p>But aren't humans supposed to be smarter than animals who run off of instincts? Humans are intellectually advanced enough to not be led by the need to breed and create offspring. </p><p>So why romance? </p><p>Why did anyone need romance?</p><p>Taiga just didn't get it. </p><p>But Kochi was happy. </p><p>Even when it was horrible to see and listen to, Taiga could tell Kochi was happy when he was with Jesse. </p><p>All of this could be worth nothing. Jesse could end up disappearing someday. The future held so many unknowns when it wasn't controlled by themselves. Maybe it would all be meaningless in a year, a month or even a day. </p><p>But it was worth it now. </p><p>Just so Kochi was happy. </p><p>Even if Taiga didn't get it at all.</p><p>"... It's nothing." Taiga looked back at his aching feet. "As long as you're having fun."</p><p>Kochi turned back to the blade of grass in his hand as his smile grew wider.</p><p>"I wanted to ask… You said you and Matsumura know each other because you left your notebook at the restaurant, right? You said the same thing a few weeks ago at dinner," Kochi asked as he let the blade slip from his fingers. </p><p>"... Yeah."</p><p>Taiga had honestly almost forgotten about him. </p><p>At least Taiga did his best to do so. </p><p>Between the two things Taiga chose to ignore, he had chosen to ignore Hokuto over Kochi and Jesse. While watching the two of them was like some form of medieval torture, it was better than acknowledging the man who was supposed to be his "date". </p><p>"What about it?"</p><p>Kochi looked up after hearing Jesse call his name from afar. "You two seem to know each other better than you let on," he said as he raised his hand to wave at Jesse, leading him over to them. </p><p>Kochi wasn't wrong but Taiga didn't want to admit it and certainly didn't want to acknowledge it. To him, all the other stuff was just a blur he chose to forget and act like never happened. </p><p>But he would be mortified if Kochi knew more than he let on.</p><p>"... What makes you say that?" </p><p>Kochi smiled up at Jesse as he took the drink from his hand. </p><p>"It's just that he has been tending you all day."</p><p>"... Huh?"</p><p>When Kochi turned to him, his eyes weren't looking at him, but at someone above him. </p><p>And when Taiga followed Kochi's line of sight, Hokuto was standing beside him, placing a drink in his hand that he didn't know he was holding his hand out for. </p><p>…… How long had Hokuto been carrying his bag?... </p><p>As well as his purchases that he had gotten at one of the stores earlier?...</p><p>Hokuto glanced over at him, almost seeming surprised to receive Taiga's gaze before he gave him a small smile and leaned down to him.</p><p>"I know you take your coffee with milk and sugar. I hope I added enough when it's iced." </p><p>Taiga's eyebrows began to furrow as he watched Hokuto unwrap and push a straw into the cup in his hand.</p><p>For just how long had Hokuto been doing this?... </p><p>Now thinking back on it, things had appeared and disappeared from his hands without him noticing. </p><p>He had been so caught up in scorning the happy couple in front of him that he didn't pay any mind to how the food or bags were placed or taken from his hands while his body just gave and took like they were meant to be there. </p><p>And after Taiga refused Hokuto's hand to help to his feet as Jesse did with Kochi, it didn't stop. </p><p>Only this time, Taiga noticed. </p><p>After a ride, Hokuto would hold out a bottle of water to him, which Taiga took and drank to curb the queasiness from his stomach. When the group stopped at a cart for a treat, Hokuto would buy and give Taiga his share before Taiga could buy it himself. </p><p>Whenever Taiga had a bag to carry, Hokuto would take it for him before Taiga could even object. </p><p>He had even taken Taiga's empty iced coffee to toss before he knew he was done with it.</p><p>Maybe if it was just that, Taiga could have just let it slide.</p><p>If Hokuto wanted to act like a hired hand that tended to him, hand and knee, then why should he stop him? He could just let Hokuto buy him things and carry his things for the day and then finally remove Hokuto from his life after today.</p><p>But it was everything else that got on Taiga's nerves. </p><p>It was everything that Hokuto did to treat this like a date.</p><p>Hokuto held the door open for him, led Taiga to go in front of him in lines, held out his hand for him whenever he stepped up or down a stair, blocked the sun for him and guarded him from splashing water. </p><p>He moved Taiga away from busy pathways and kept himself between Taiga and a rushing crowd.</p><p>He stood in front of him on the train, using his body to make an open space for Taiga by the door while the crushing crowd pushed against his back.</p><p>It was all and everything.</p><p>And it pissed him off.</p><p>The last straw was when Kochi brought them into the haunted house where they were, of course, put in pairs. </p><p>Taiga did his best to bite through it, telling himself this was a child's attraction and everything was fake. That there was nothing to be scared of. </p><p>And when the ghost popped out of its hole, making Taiga yelp and trip over his feet, Hokuto was there to catch and hold him. </p><p>"Are you alright?" </p><p>Hokuto's soft voice was enough to make Taiga shudder. </p><p>It didn't help that when Taiga looked at Hokuto over his shoulder, the distance between their faces made all the memories he had fought to suppress resurface as they replayed at the forefront of his mind.  </p><p>His breath. </p><p>His touch. </p><p>His lips.</p><p>A chill ran down Taiga's spine when he felt Hokuto's hands move up from his arms he caught him by, rounding over his shoulders. </p><p>Taiga shoved Hokuto back as if he wasn't the one he had backed up into him before glaring at him.</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>Hokuto raised an eyebrow as he adjusted his footing after being pushed away.</p><p>"Stop what?"</p><p>A screaming from behind Taiga made him flinch as a gathering of footsteps grew closer. </p><p>The group behind them was catching up.</p><p>Taiga grabbed the cuff of Hokuto's shirt and dragged him into the next room. </p><p>"Stop treating this like a date," Taiga snipped at him as he rushed them forward, weaving through claw-like branches that hung over them. </p><p>"Is this not a date?" Hokuto asked as he let Taiga pull him forward until Taiga jumped from a zombie emerging and groaning from around a tree, making him bump into him again. </p><p>Taiga shot daggers at Hokuto as if it was his fault for their collision before tugging him forward through the rooms once again. </p><p>"No, it's not a <em>date</em>." </p><p>Taiga nearly spat the word 'date' as he said it as if the word had personally insulted him before.</p><p>"I am here just to help a friend. You and I are not here together." </p><p>Once they had made a decent lead ahead of the group behind them, Taiga spun around and sharply whipped Hokuto's arm back at its owner.</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> a girl and I am certainly <em>not</em> one of the many girls you go on dates with."</p><p>A deep pound of an echoing drum and collected chime of temple bells played around them as they stood in an "abandoned" temple, Taiga blowing the hair from his eyes as he squinted at the poorly lit man in front of him.</p><p>"We both want this to be a success for our friends, right?"</p><p>Hokuto fixed his sleeve as he kept his eyes locked on Taiga, despite the ominous gurgling of the well beside them.</p><p>"Sure." </p><p>Taiga held up his hand between them with three fingers up.</p><p>"Then to make this work I'm setting three rules."</p><p>He lowered a finger.</p><p>"First. This is not a date."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Taiga lowered the next finger.</p><p>"Second. Stop treating me like some girl."</p><p>"Mhm."</p><p>The last raised finger was used to jab Hokuto hard at the center of his chest as Taiga glared into his eyes.</p><p>"Last and most importantly, you do <em>not</em> touch me."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Taiga blinked as Hokuto stepped forwards towards him, making his feet stutter back. </p><p>"If you have three rules, then give me just one."</p><p>By Taiga's rules, Hokuto technically wasn't breaking them when he hooked his finger into the open top of Taiga's bag he had taken back from him to pull his shoulder back towards him. </p><p>Even as Hokuto pulled him back, Taiga leaned the rest of his body away as Hokuto grew closer. </p><p>"I-it depends," Taiga stammered, losing all his bite as Hokuto moved close. "What is it?"</p><p>"Let me spoil you."</p><p>When the tug on his bag was gone, Taiga hadn't realized his eyes were closed as they blinked open to train on Hokuto's back as he walked past him.</p><p>Taiga quickly trailed after, following him to the shrine they were meant to offer their fake candles to.</p><p>"No, I told you this wasn't a-"</p><p>Hokuto clapped his hands together, following the instructions written in blood across the sign as Taiga scrambled to catch up, hastily setting the candle down to place his hands together as well. </p><p>He should have expected that when they bowed, a ghost would burst from the shrine. </p><p>This time, Hokuto jumped as well. </p><p>They escaped to the next room, speeding through the tattered fabric draped over the doorway, the wailing of the ghost calling behind them before the last sheet blinded them with the daylight behind it, revealing that they reached the exit. </p><p>Taiga gasped in the fresh air as he doubled over to catch his breath.</p><p>His heart was pounding.</p><p>It was hard to say from what.</p><p>It was probably from the panic of escaping the fake terror of a tortured shine maiden or maybe just the fact that he was incredibly out of shape and ducking through a maze of thick curtains was more effort than it seemed. </p><p>Any of that could have been it. </p><p>Just not the bright airy laugh Hokuto let out after they stumbled out of the exit.</p><p>"Hokuto! Kyomoto!"</p><p>Jesse called to them from across the exit where he and Kochi were waiting. Hokuto raised a hand back and began to head towards them.</p><p>Taiga threw out his hand to grab his wrist, Hokuto's gold bracelet slipping between his grip.</p><p>"Wait! About what I said-"</p><p>Hokuto turned back to him, the smile from his laughter still on his lips. </p><p>"A mother can still spoil her child, right? It doesn't have to be a date."</p><p>With that, Taiga let go. </p><p>He watched as Hokuto met back with Kochi and Jesse, grinning as Jesse laughed at how lost they looked when they burst out from the exit.</p><p>Taiga began to walk towards them, still watching how Hokuto's canines showed when he smiled.</p><p>Arguing with Hokuto always felt like a losing battle. </p><p>Every time, Hokuto completely overwhelmed him, leaving him speechless and only left with the option to run. </p><p>He was running. </p><p>Taiga knew he was running. </p><p>He was running from something he didn't understand.</p><p>But even then, if he was running then Hokuto was chasing him. Chasing him and forcing him to think of things he'd rather ignore. </p><p>But why him?...</p><p>Weren't there swarms of girls that would have happily run into his arms? Why did Hokuto choose to pick him? </p><p>There was nothing special about him that would make anyone want to fight for him…</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Right.</p><p>None of it mattered.</p><p>Just like his editor said before, everyone knew it wasn't serious.</p><p>He was the same as all the others. </p><p>He was just a game that was harder to catch.</p><p>"Taiga! Did you get scared?" Kochi asked, grinning as Taiga joined back with the group.</p><p>"... Only a little." </p><p>Kochi laughed and gently nudged his arm with his fist. "You definitely got scared!"</p><p>Taiga willed himself to smile and laugh with them as he denied his fear again.</p><p>It was embarrassing to be scared of fake ghosts and plastic monsters that popped out in a dark hallway, especially when the real world was much scarier. </p><p>The animatronic monsters all disappeared after walking out the last door. That's why they could all laugh after and joke about who yelled the loudest or who jumped the highest. </p><p>But doors couldn't hold back and keep how he felt.</p><p>Whether he realized it or not.</p><h6></h6><p>The sky began to change colors, the cloudless blue dyeing yellow and orange as the sun started to set. </p><p>Hokuto followed his rules. </p><p>He didn't offer his hand or move him behind him when performers riding toy cars and bikes sped by. He gave Taiga back his bags and didn't offer his coat when rain fell over them. </p><p>He didn't touch him. He kept his hands off and away from him and when Taiga bumped into him from the pushing crowd, he held his hands up to keep them to himself. </p><p>Hokuto didn't call it a date again.</p><p>But he still spoiled him. </p><p>He still paid for his things and let him go first in line. He gave them the seat when there was only one seat left and offered his hand towel when Taiga tried to wipe the rain off his glasses with his shirt. Even as they shared a store ledge to shelter from the showers, Hokuto gave Taiga the space, leaving himself with only enough to cover his head as his shoulder was soaked by the rain until the sky cleared.</p><p>Since Hokuto listened to his demands, Taiga couldn't bring himself to push Hokuto away. </p><p>If Hokuto obeyed his three rules, then he had no reason to reject his one request. Especially when it only benefited him.</p><p>Jesse checked his watch before turning to face the others. </p><p>"The firework show is about to start in a bit. Should we try to find a place to watch before it gets too crowded?"</p><p>Kochi smiled, moving to stand beside him. "That sounds like a good idea. The center plaza is the best place to watch, right?"</p><p>Honestly, Taiga wished he could just go home. </p><p>His feet ached and his body was tired. More than anything, he wanted to sink into a hot bath before eventually having an internal crisis about the time he wasted coming here. </p><p>But as much as he wanted to say he'd rather just leave now to avoid fighting the exiting crowd, he kept quiet.</p><p>Just so Kochi could spend a few more hours with Jesse.</p><p>When they grew closer to the plaza, the crowd only got thicker, evident that they weren't the only ones with the same idea.</p><p>Taiga saw Kochi take Jesse's hand to not lose him in the crowd, neither of them shy as their hold was hidden amongst the densening maze of people.</p><p>For a second, Taiga worried about losing sight of them as the pair smoothly weaved through, gaining distance, until his shoulder bag was suddenly held back, making his body lurch. </p><p>At first instinct, Taiga assumed he was being robbed. </p><p>A thick crowd was an excellent way for a pickpocket to take someone's belongings before blending in with the crowd. </p><p>He tugged his bag back and swung around as much as he could, ready to shout or yell at whoever tried to steal from him, but was only met with Hokuto gripping the straps of his bag again with his finger pressed to his lips.</p><p>"What are you-"</p><p>"Just come with me."</p><p>Taiga's feet stumbled forward as Hokuto began to lead him back out of the crowd. </p><p>"Hey-! We're losing the other two!" Taiga shouted after him as Hokuto continued to bring him further away from the plaza. </p><p>"That's the point," Hokuto replied as he brought them around a corner.</p><p>"I told you we're not on a date-" Taiga grabbed Hokuto's wrist to try to pry his hand off his bag. The last thing Taiga wanted was to let Hokuto bring him somewhere private so he could pull whatever crap he wanted to try to make this romantic.</p><p>"We're not." </p><p>His pulling stopped when Hokuto turned to face him.</p><p>Taiga expected him to be wearing the smile he had whenever he teased him or made the girls at his restaurant blush. He thought he would say something that would make girls swoon and fall at his feet. </p><p>But his face was calm with no intention to make this anything more than it was.</p><p>"But they are," Hokuto finished.</p><p>It was irritating how reasonable he was.</p><p>Taiga clenched his teeth before tightening his grip to rip Hokuto's hand off his straps.</p><p>"You don't have to pull me…" Taiga said as adjusted his bag. </p><p>"I can walk myself."</p><p>Hokuto just watched as Taiga pushed past him, but smiled as he followed after.</p><p>"Follow the path on the right. There's a place to sit."</p><h6></h6><p>The park had grown dark, only illuminated by the golden lights glowing from stylized street lanterns and open stores with a glow poured from their entrances as Hokuto returned to the bench Taiga waited at, holding out a hot drink for him to take.</p><p>"I got you tea this time. I wasn't sure if you wanted something caffeinated this late." </p><p>"... Thanks."</p><p>Taiga took the paper cup from his hand as Hokuto sat down beside him with his own drink, taking a sip from it as they sat in silence.</p><p>There was hardly anyone around. </p><p>There were a few scattered couples and families that took advantage of the short lines as most crowded at the plaza for the final show, but it was nothing compared to the thick swarm that filled the path before.</p><p>"I apologize if you were looking forward to the fireworks," Hokuto said as leaned back against the wooden bench. "Jesse asked that I give them some time alone."</p><p>Taiga watched the fading trail of steam flow out the lid of his cup.</p><p>Honestly, Taiga didn't really care about the fireworks, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to use it as one of the growing list of reasons why he disliked Hokuto.</p><p>But if it was Jesse's idea to be with Kochi, he really couldn't bring himself to be upset.</p><p>"It's fine… I rather not stand in that crowd."</p><p>"I didn't think so." Hokuto brought his drink to his lips again. "But the view from here isn't so bad, either."</p><p>Taiga nearly dropped his cup in shock when the boom of the first firework burst in the dark sky as symphonic music echoed from afar.</p><p>He missed the first one, but he saw how its lights colored the tiled path at his feet before he fixed his glasses and raised his head. </p><p>It had been a long time since Taiga had been fascinated by fireworks. </p><p>He remembered how amazing the flashing lights were when he saw them for the first time at a summer festival. His young heart was racing in excitement as he squeezed his mother's hand, staring wide eyed at the sky.</p><p>Nothing could quite replace the thrill of childlike wonder, but seeing the fireworks through the space between two buildings in front of them was shockingly close. </p><p>It was like the roofs were leaning away from the glimmering sparks of fire to frame them perfectly. If Taiga hadn't known any better, he would have assumed that they were built intentionally to hold the colors that lit up the dark sky. </p><p>"Pretty good, right?"</p><p>When Taiga turned his eyes to Hokuto, he wasn't sure what he was expecting.</p><p>He just knew it wasn't this.</p><p>Hokuto's smile was soft as he watched the show. The park lights were lowered, letting the colors of the fireworks dye and paint his skin. </p><p>The colors changed. White to blue. Blue to red. Red to gold. Gold to purple. Shifting and blending over his image.</p><p>Taiga closed his mouth that he didn't know he had opened.</p><p>Hokuto was undeniably handsome. </p><p>In every way.</p><p>There was no wonder why girls fell at his feet.</p><p>Taiga turned to look back to the lights as he eased back into his seat.</p><p>"... How many girls have you brought here before?"</p><p>He heard Hokuto laugh under his breath.</p><p>"Not sure… Not too many. Maybe 4 or 5."</p><p>Taiga watched shapes appear in the sky as planets and characters, before they faded away into only smoke.</p><p>"Is 5 not that many?..."</p><p>"I guess it's all relative… Have you brought anyone here before?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"... Have you ever been on a date?"</p><p>"Of course…"</p><p>"Were any of them with men?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>When Taiga turned to shout at Hokuto, he didn't think their eyes would meet.</p><p>He flinched as his eyes shot away as if he had been caught staring at someone he wasn't supposed to, quickly taking a sip of his tea in hopes that it would disguise his recoil as intentional. </p><p>Taiga really wished Hokuto would stop asking him about his interest in the same gender.</p><p>He really didn't care how others had their preference, it just wasn't him.</p><p>He had no interest in being with anyone, let alone another man.</p><p>"Have you?"</p><p>"I haven't… Well, unless you could today," Hokuto thought to himself. "But as you said, this isn't a date."</p><p>Taiga's grip tightened on his cup.</p><p>Was it really all that simple?...</p><p>Someone asks and simply saying yes?</p><p>Did it really not matter who it was or who it was with? </p><p>Taiga couldn't understand things like love and romance. </p><p>But he also didn't understand giving it all away.</p><p>Hokuto was only here because his friend asked him to support him on his date. It couldn't have mattered if it was Taiga who came along with Kochi or not.</p><p>Whoever it was, Hokuto would have treated them just the same.</p><p>It just happened that he would be the one put on Hokuto's never ending list of names.</p><p>This wasn't even a date, but Hokuto gave his everything as if it was.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Hm?" Hokuto rested the edge of his cup on his lip.</p><p>Taiga just watched the lights.</p><p>"Why do you go on all these dates?... I was told that you say yes to anyone. Are you even looking for the right person?..."</p><p>There was a moment of silence as Hokuto thought, the audience clapping and cheering in the distance as large spreading streaks of lights showered over them. </p><p>"... Can I ask you something first?" </p><p>"... Fine."</p><p>"Why do you write?"</p><p>A thundering boom waved past them as the sky lit up, Taiga's eyes widening with the fading sparks of light.</p><p>… He wasn't sure. </p><p>Why did he write?... </p><p>Was it really only for the money?</p><p>Where did it all start?</p><p>Did he even remember anymore?...</p><p>He wasn't sure, but his lips still parted.</p><p>"Isn't it nice to escape?... To escape and just not think about the real world?"</p><p>Words spilled from Taiga's mouth before he could make sense of them himself.</p><p>"Words can craft a place you can live in and thrive in, but you can withdraw from it when it's all over. It can give someone solace or sanctuary, even if it's only for a moment. Sometimes people just need to run away and stories can do that."</p><p>"If I can make these worlds… why not share them?"</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure if he truly believed what he said. It wasn't exactly an interview appropriate answer, but if it came from his mouth, there must have been some truth in it. Even if it was just a little idealistic.</p><p>"... Then we're not all that different."</p><p>His body wanted to face the voice that spoke, but Taiga didn't dare look at him again.</p><p>So he just continued to watch.</p><p>"What do you mean?..."</p><p>Hokuto opened the lid of his cup to look at the dark drink held within it, seeing that there was only a little left.</p><p>"You're giving your readers escapism, right?"</p><p>"I am too. Just a little differently."</p><p>Taiga stayed quiet as Hokuto drank the rest of the contents of his cup. </p><p>"Sometimes they're just tired of dating or being mistreated. All they want is to be cared for like they matter, even if it's just for a day."</p><p>"I'm letting them escape by giving them exactly what they want. They know it's nothing serious, so why not let them pretend? I also have fun too."</p><p>The firework show was reaching its end, evident by the escalating and climatic music. The rattling of cymbals and drums banging and clashing with the explosions of lights in unison.</p><p>Taiga raised his cup from his lap as he spoke.</p><p>"... Is it for them?... Or is it really for you?"</p><p>The sky filled with lights. All the fireworks were set off one after another, illuminating the park as if it were day. Each firework that boomed was more amazing than the next, all different in shape and sizes as they burst in the air. </p><p>Hokuto didn't see any of them.</p><p>He just watched as Taiga finished his tea, the patterns reflecting in his glasses.</p><p>"... I wonder…"</p><p>His voice was swallowed by the last finale and roar of the cheering audience.</p><p>Taiga blinked as his cup left his hand. </p><p>"Let's go find the other two," Hokuto smiled as he stacked the cup with his own to throw away.</p><p>When they found Jesse and Kochi by the exit, they looked just as pleased as the other. </p><p>They had stories that they wouldn't tell which Taiga thankfully didn't want to hear. </p><p>"I'm going to take Kochi home."</p><p>Hokuto gave Jesse a questioning look.</p><p>"Did you forget that you don't know how to drive? Or that I drove you here?"</p><p>"We'll take the train. It's fine," Jesse smiled.</p><p>Hokuto sighed as he opened his bag to find his keys.</p><p>"I guess I'll head home alone."</p><p>Taiga was mid yawn before he felt a push at his shoulder, his feet stumbling before he caught his balance at Hokuto's side.</p><p>"Take Taiga with you!" Kochi called towards them as he and Jesse already began walking away. "He'll give you his address!"</p><p>Taiga was too tired to argue. As long as he got home, he didn't care. </p><p>Also third wheeling on a crowded train sounded much worse than just extending his far too long day with Hokuto a bit longer.</p><p>They both slipped into Hokuto's car, Taiga holding out the address to his apartment building on his phone for Hokuto to read and put into his navigation. </p><p>The trip was quiet, mostly thanks to Taiga drifting off for most of the ride. Hokuto played music, but turned it down when he saw Taiga begin to nod off.</p><p>His eyes only opened once the familiar city lights became too bright to continue his sleep.</p><p>Taiga straightened out in his seat, the low music still playing in the car. He inhaled deeply and stretched his shoulders before placing back on his glasses he had removed to make leaning his head against the window just a bit more comfortable. </p><p>His place was only a couple more blocks away. </p><p>Neither of them said a word.</p><p>Hokuto pulled up next to his building entrance, the curb completely vacant in the late night. </p><p>Taiga opened the door and slipped his bags onto his shoulder.</p><p>"Thanks…"</p><p>As he began to step out the door, Hokuto grabbed his hand.</p><p>Taiga's head whipped over to Hokuto when he felt the pull on his arm, his grip still on the door handle.</p><p>"Go on a date with me."</p><p>Taiga's eyes widened before his brow furrowed.</p><p>He spoke in a near whisper.</p><p>"... What?..."</p><p>He almost laughed.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Hokuto's grip tightened on his hand.</p><p>"Just once."</p><p>"I want to show you how nice it can be."</p><p>Taiga pulled on his hand as he faced back out the door, but Hokuto held tight.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Just one time. We'll do whatever you want. I'll cook for you."</p><p>"I told you, I don't need any of that. Now let me-"</p><p>"I'll never bother you again."</p><p>Taiga stilled.</p><p>"... If you don't enjoy yourself, I'll never come near you again. Even if you come to Salut. I'll have our other waiter serve you."</p><p>Taiga's eyes wandered before meeting with Hokuto's. </p><p>They were serious. </p><p>He wasn't kidding.</p><p>Taiga felt his chest squeeze.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why him?</p><p>He didn't get it…</p><p>…</p><p>… Whatever.</p><p>If it meant he could finally be alone.</p><p>"... Will it be full course?"</p><p>"Whatever you want."</p><p>"... Fine."</p><p>Taiga tugged back his hand as Hokuto finally let go. </p><p>He stepped out of the car and stood by it, the door still ajar. </p><p>"Next Saturday." </p><p>Hokuto leaned over the center console to meet Taiga's eyes through the open door.</p><p>"I can do that. Where will we meet?"</p><p>Taiga took a step back, ready to swing the door shut. </p><p>But before he did, he pointed at Hokuto's phone where the navigation was still on display.</p><p>"You have my address."</p>

  <p>When Taiga told Hokuto that he had been on a date before, he lied.</p><p>Of <em>course</em>, he had never been on a date. He spent the majority of his highschool career brooding about how useless it was so by what reason would he have ever wanted to go on one? </p><p>The most Taiga had ever done was kiss a girl once… </p><p>Though it was more like the girl kissed him. </p><p>The girl had caught him off guard, catching his lips after he had leaned over to try to explain an equation she asked about. It was unfortunate that she thought their feelings were mutual, she had been a great study partner. But all Taiga could do was brush it off like an accident, making the rest of the evening uncomfortably awkward. After that, he didn't go back to the library to study ever again.</p><p>So <em>of course</em> it was a lie, but Hokuto didn't have to know that.</p><p>Taiga just had to play it cool and act like this was something he had plenty, or at least a decent, amount of experience in before.</p><p>Yet, as the scheduled Saturday came closer, Taiga found himself locked in a mental battle with himself.</p><p>Each day that he stepped out of his room to be greeted with the mess of books and papers in his main room, he was struck with indecision.</p><p>Clean his apartment or keep it exactly as it was.</p><p>His instinct was to clean as one typically does before a guest arrives, but the point of the "date" was not to have a good time. </p><p>The deal was if Taiga didn't enjoy himself, then he could finally rid himself of Matsumura Hokuto. So in that case, wasn't it better to keep his room messy?... </p><p>But wasn't it sort of bad to not have any open counter space at all?</p><p>As days passed, Taiga would stare at the mess and contemplate, fighting with himself before deciding that he would figure it out later, only leaving himself to have the same internal argument the next day. </p><p>By Saturday morning, he gave up.</p><p>He didn't want to clean it anyways. It would stay as it is. </p><p>But he did at least remove the books and papers from the kitchen island as the coffee maker prepared his drink, leaving it oddly clean in contrast to the rest of the space, only to have a similar battle with himself in his bedroom mirror with his mug in hand.</p><p>Get dressed or stay what he was in now.</p><p>Taiga stood before his reflection, looking over the exact same outfit he had already worn for weeks.</p><p>For a complete unromantic dinner with a person he had no interest in, wearing his repeated home clothes felt like enough, but looking like a slob in front of a person who has dressed so fashionably just the other day, felt like social suicide.</p><p>Also the toothpaste stains on his shirt couldn't really be called trendy…</p><p>Taiga groaned as he pulled it off from over his head.</p><p>Shirts and tops were pulled out and thrown over his bed as he argued with himself about the appropriate level of effort to look nice, but not nice enough to appear like he tried.</p><p>A button up was too much.</p><p>He had already worn his one pair of jeans.</p><p>His sweatpants from college were probably too ragged.</p><p>Taiga's limited understanding of fashion gave him no help as he fought with his closet, but after what felt like an hour too long of fighting something he didn't know, it felt like a waste of energy to not at least try to look a little better than usual.</p><p>Only a little. </p><p>A zip up hoodie was kind of fashionable. Maybe.</p><p>Taiga checked his watch as he sipped at his cold coffee.</p><p>It was 12 pm.</p><p>He had about-…</p><p>… Actually, he had no idea how much time he had. </p><p>Thinking back on it, he was in such a rush to get away from the car that he only told Hokuto where they would meet, but not a unit number or time.</p><p>Hokuto said he would cook for him and it was about lunchtime. </p><p>Would it be better if he ate? Or should he wait if Hokuto was cooking? Was Hokuto only making dinner?</p><p>If it's only dinner, should he prepare something? What could he prepare?? Was Hokuto expecting to have lunch here??</p><p>What could he-</p><p>Taiga's brain stopped when he realized that he had already started searching through his pantry, frozen with the cabinet handle still gripped in his hand.</p><p>"…… What the hell am I doing?..."</p><p>Why in the world was he fretting so much over a date that he wanted to fail??</p><p>Taiga took his anger out on the pantry door, slamming it shut.</p><p>Somehow, even when he wasn't there, Hokuto had managed to irritate him by the fact that he had worried about the <em>date</em> at all.</p><p>Trying to be considerate about Hokuto's arrival should have been the furthest thing from the top of his mind, especially when he was another week closer to losing his job.</p><p>Taiga clicked his tongue and left the kitchen to return to his computer, only to come back a second later to heat the leftovers he got from take out yesterday.</p><p>Food didn't taste as good on a full stomach.</p><p>When he finally sat down at his desk with his lunch, Taiga did his best to do anything besides worry about when Hokuto would arrive. </p><p>If Hokuto had to ask the doorman about his unit number, then that's just what Hokuto had to do. Taiga wasn't going to wait on the main floor to wait for him to arrive. Absolutely not. He didn't even consider it for a single breath of a moment.</p><p>… But that didn't mean that Taiga was constantly checking his phone and the time.</p><p>When his ringtone chimed, he hated how much he scrambled for it.</p><p>Taiga brushed down his shirt as if anyone could see him through the phone as picked up the call, trying to speak as normally as possible.</p><p>Hopefully Hokuto didn't notice that his voice was abnormally deep when he answered.</p><p>"H-hello?"</p><p>
  <em>"Hello? Kyomoto? It's Matsumura. Will you buzz me in?"</em>
</p><p>Taiga cleared his throat, adjusting and pulling back his normal tone as he went to the panel to unlock the front door, quickly scanning for the button he had hardly used until recently. </p><p>"Um yeah. Hold on."</p><p>Most people who came to visit already knew the code inside. All Taiga had to do was wait until they knocked on the door. </p><p>The pressed button came with a mechanical click after Taiga released it.</p><p>"It should be open now."</p><p>
  <em>"Got it. It opened. I'll be up there in a bit."</em>
</p><p>Taiga hung up the call with a sigh and checked the time on the screen. </p><p>It was exactly 3 pm.</p><p>Hokuto was somehow annoyingly on time without even having a meeting time scheduled.</p><p>After shoving his phone back in his pocket, Taiga anxiously tried to find something to do with himself during the couple minutes it took for Hokuto to arrive.</p><p>Once the doorbell rang, he stopped the pointless shuffling of books he had chosen as his task and went to answer the door, avoiding making eye contact with Hokuto's stupid face as it opened. </p><p>"Hey."</p><p>"How did you find my unit number?" Taiga asked in a flat tone.</p><p>"I had Jesse ask your friend," Hokuto smiled as he held up the bags in his hands, even though Taiga's eyes were focused on the wall behind him. "Can I place some things in your fridge?"</p><p>Taiga stepped back to let him in, gesturing silently to the fridge set in the kitchen area in the back of the room.</p><p>As Hokuto slipped off his shoes and walked past him with a bow, Taiga's body started to stiffen with the realization that he had absolutely no idea what he should do now.</p><p>All he wanted was for Hokuto to finally leave him alone at the end of the day, but he didn't think about the details of what would happen on their "date" between now and then.</p><p>He should have spent less time worrying about what to do before Hokuto arrived and started to think about what to do after.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>"Kyomoto?"</p><p>Taiga nearly jumped when Hokuto's voice broke through his stirring thoughts, bringing him to realize that he was still standing at the door, holding it open long after Hokuto had already made it to the fridge.</p><p>He shut it just hard enough to not slam it.</p><p>He adjusted his glasses, suddenly becoming extremely conscious of how he used his hands as he joined Hokuto in the kitchen space..</p><p>"Uh. Yeah? What?"</p><p>Hokuto raised an eyebrow, setting the rest of his groceries on the recently cleared counter as he watched Taiga shove his hands in his pocket.</p><p>"Did you want to go anywhere before we eat? I can take you anywhere you like."</p><p>Taiga began to open his mouth, a retort ready on his tongue to ask why the hell he would want to do that, but he paused when he remembered.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Hokuto intended to make this a date.</p><p>If he didn't take control of the situation, then Hokuto would.</p><p>He had to assert himself before Hokuto pulled him into his flow and just as he did at the theme park and there was no way in hell Taiga was about to let that happen again.</p><p>Taiga let out a sharp breath.</p><p>"Listen, Matsumura-"</p><p>"Today you can call me Hokuto."</p><p>Taiga's tongue tripped when Hokuto spoke over him and smiled as he leaned over the counter, making Taiga lose his train of thought.</p><p>"Wh-... No. Matsumura is fine… but what I'm trying to say-...... Don't interrupt me," he fumbled as his brow furrowed.</p><p>Taiga hated how easily Hokuto could laugh.</p><p>"Sorry, go on?"</p><p>Taiga sighed and restarted himself. </p><p>"What I was going to say was that I won't be going anywhere. I intend on staying at home."</p><p>Hokuto nodded. "Okay."</p><p>"Also, I plan on staying in my room. I have a deadline that I can't miss so I will only be coming out to eat. And don't touch anything in the living room."</p><p>Taiga didn't know a lot about dating, but he at least knew that dates weren't typically spent apart and that was precisely the point. The more distance from Hokuto, the better.</p><p>Taiga was more than ready to assert his authority over the deal with the expectation that Hokuto would argue and try to propose something closer to a traditional date, but all Hokuto did was smile.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"You have to-... Huh?"</p><p>The stern tone that started in Taiga's voice was replaced with confusion when he didn't get the response he expected as Hokuto opened his bags.</p><p>"That's fine with me, but can I ask something?"</p><p>"Uh… Yeah. What is it?"</p><p>"Did you have lunch?"</p><p>Taiga crossed his arms.</p><p>"Yeah, I did." </p><p>"I assumed so since I arrived past noon, but it was possible that you thought to wait for me," Hokuto said as he removed glass containers from the bottom of the tote. "So I brought something just in case."</p><p>Taiga just watched in stunned silence. </p><p>Because Hokuto was exactly right, even including the fact that Taiga had indeed turmoiled over whether he should wait.</p><p>It could only be because of his experience.</p><p>His lots and lots of experience…</p><p>Taiga pressed his lips together, not wanting to admit that Hokuto had read his mind even before he arrived as the other placed his hand on the container. </p><p>"Do you want something small before you go to work?" </p><p>He wanted to say no, but he couldn't deny that whatever it was that he could see through the side of the container already looked to be tasty.</p><p>… Well, food couldn't hurt.</p><p>"... Fine."</p><p>Hokuto suppressed the smile that wanted to grow on his lips as he began to snap open the lids.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>After pointing to where his dinnerware was to Hokuto, Taiga waited patiently for Hokuto to dress the plate with the food as he fiddled with his phone, checking his emails and messages until a plate was soon held between his eyes and the screen.</p><p>Hokuto set his hip against the table edge Taiga leaned against, casually presenting him with the dish as Taiga slowly took the plate into his hands, staring down at the food place upon it. </p><p>It somehow looked better in the containers…</p><p>"Isn't this just like an adult version of a lunchables…"</p><p>Hokuto tapped his nail on the edge of the plate, making it give a dulled clink in Taiga's hands. "Try it and tell me what you think."</p><p>Taiga's lips formed a flat line, already doubting how something so simple could really be that impressive.</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Taiga took the plate, brushing himself away from Hokuto and returned to his room with it as Hokuto called at his back.</p><p>"Can I call you Taiga for today?"</p><p>Taiga only looked back for a second before grabbing his door handle.</p><p>"No."</p><p>And slammed the door shut.</p><p>Hokuto watched it for a moment before laughing quietly to himself and returning to his groceries, while on the other side, Taiga was letting out a long deep sigh, resisting the urge to audibly groan as he dropped the plate on his desk and woke up his computer.</p><p>As he stared at the screen flickering on, Taiga took one of the topped thin disks of bread and shoved all of it in his mouth.</p><p>He reached his hands out over his keyboard to tap his password in, but before his fingers hit the keys, he quickly grabbed another slice and ate it whole.</p><p>Taiga really wished he could discredit Hokuto's work and call it just a more expensive version of a child's snack, but it really tasted great.</p><p>The cured meat matched wonderfully with the fresh cheese that was carefully portioned onto each cut of bread. Just the bread by itself was amazing as it was delightfully crispy around the edges but held a delicate soft middle. </p><p>It was surprising how much the thin spread of jam on the base added to the flavor. The hint of sweetness cut through the robust tastes of the meat and cheese to round the whole profile together.</p><p>By the time Taiga had opened up his document, he had already eaten 3.</p><p>He frowned as he licked off the dap of jam that had gotten on his thumb.</p><p>It was distracting him. </p><p>Taiga huffed out a heavy breath and shoved the plate away, trying to refocus himself on his work as he scrolled and skimmed through the last few pages of his writing.</p><p>In the last week, he had finally thought of an idea.</p><p>Well, maybe more like half an idea. Or even just the vague suggestion of an idea or just a sliver of a concept, but he was trying to run with what he had.</p><p>The grand idea was simply that he wanted to write something different.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>It wasn't much, but it was something.</p><p>He didn't want to write in the mystery genre again. </p><p>While thrillers were fun to write, the genre started to feel as if it was drowning him, swallowed by the constraints of his previous works, and all Taiga wanted was a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Escapism. </p><p>Wasn't that the reason he gave Hokuto when he asked why he wrote? </p><p>Taiga wanted to escape too. </p><p>Just to something different.</p><p>He sighed as he ate another slice of his snack.</p><p>The problem was that he still didn't know what.</p><p>He just knew it wasn't romance.</p><h6></h6><p>Time passed as Taiga wrote descriptions of scenery just to see if something else would follow. One of Kochi's books was set up on a stand his editor lent him, the images aiding his words.</p><p>He slowly nibbled at a piece of bread, the cheese and meat already consumed, as he enjoyed the sweet jam, ripping parts of the crust off from the center with his teeth and crunching on it steadily as he wrote.</p><p>The rest of his bite hung between his lips as he blindly reached for another as words stirred in his head, but as his fingers tapped around the plate, he felt nothing.</p><p>His eyes looked over to confirm that it was empty.</p><p>Damnit.</p><p>Taiga took the rest of the bread into his mouth, savoring the last of what he had before swallowing it down.</p><p>The snack had been a good distraction to keep his body busy while his mind focused on the screen. After all, it was a much better alternative to the ends of pens which Taiga had destroyed with his teeth, but with none left, his mouth felt lonely and the end of his pen was a poor replacement.</p><p>Either way, he still had to write but when he put his hand back on the keyboard, no words followed as his cursor sat still.</p><p>… He had completely forgotten what he was going to write.</p><p>Taiga clicked his tongue as he deleted the remainder of the incomplete thought, finding it useless to try to remember the rest as the time at the corner of his screen caught his eye.</p><p>It had already been almost an hour and a half and Hokuto still hadn't tried to bother him since he had closed his door.</p><p>Of course Taiga was pleased that Hokuto was doing exactly as he asked, but a side of him had expected Hokuto to be more aggressive about making this day a date.</p><p>The unmoved cursor continued to blink on the white page as Taiga sat quietly.</p><p>Maybe he should check on him–</p><p>No. No, he shouldn't. He should stay right where he is. The point was to avoid interacting with him.</p><p>But wouldn't it be good if he saw what he was doing? Taiga had more or less given him free range of his apartment. Shouldn't he at least check on him to see if he was still there?</p><p>Maybe Hokuto was already gone. Maybe he had given up and just went home.</p><p>Before he knew it, Taiga had his hand on his door handle. </p><p>Taiga knew what he should have done.</p><p>He should have just stayed in his room as he said. He knew that any moment around Hokuto was dangerous and was just another chance for Hokuto to pull him into his plans.</p><p>But the door still came open as Taiga turned the handle, releasing it from its latch as it quietly opened.</p><p>Taiga didn't know what he was expecting, though it didn't really matter.</p><p>Anything that Taiga would have seen would have surprised him.</p><p>He just didn't think that Hokuto would be acting so normally as if nothing about this situation was strange. </p><p>From the crack that Taiga made in his doorway, he could see Hokuto using his space as if it was his own. The counters were filled, but with ingredients and tools that were placed with purpose and used with intention. It was neat and organized for what Taiga could only assume as cooking.</p><p>Yet, what caught Taiga's attention was not the kitchen he could barely recognize as his own, but the man who used it.</p><p>By himself, Taiga didn't use his kitchen very often. From time to time, he decided to try to attempt a recipe or make something he was craving at the moment, only to have it always come out just a little bit off, whether it was the misshapen vegetables or consistency being strange. Cooking just wasn't something he understood and relied on pre-prepared food from convenience stores or take out. The only thing he could take pride in was the quality of his rice made by a cooker. That, at least, he has pinned down. </p><p>But Hokuto used the kitchen Taiga had owned for the last 5 years in ways he didn't recognize. He used the space in a way that made it look as if it was an extension of himself, perfectly orchestrated to his pace. It almost looked like the kitchen worked for him more than he was working to use it.</p><p>Taiga stepped out and shut the door behind him as Hokuto returned to the cutting board set on the island with vegetables balanced in his hand and a knife in the other. </p><p>He didn't notice how Hokuto glanced up at him as he laid out his various items before smiling and looking back down at his work. </p><p>Taiga knew Hokuto worked in a restaurant. He had agreed to let him make dinner for him, even though he had only seen Hokuto serve and not cook, but it wasn't too far off to assume that Hokuto would be good with a knife.</p><p>So then why was it so mesmerizing?...</p><p>It wasn't like Taiga had never seen a cooking show before. He had seen how professionals cooked and how all their work flowed like second nature at least a couple times when he was flipping through channels. </p><p>Maybe that was just the difference between watching it on a TV screen and seeing it in front of him in his own kitchen. </p><p>Or maybe it was something about Hokuto's hands.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure.</p><p>Either way, it was amazing how simply cutting vegetables looked so graceful. </p><p>The onions and carrots came apart as if they were meant to be in slices before being neatly pushed aside for the next. Hokuto's fingers were posed gracefully, yet firmly, as they worked smoothly with the knife.</p><p>"Are you hungry?"</p><p>Taiga's heart nearly leaped out of his chest when Hokuto disrupted his trance, making him  jolt behind one of the thin pillars that framed the entrance to the kitchen from the living room as if he had any chance of pretending he wasn't there.</p><p>Taiga thumped his head against it as he cringed at himself.</p><p>He was just trying to get a better view. He didn't realize that he had moved closer.</p><p>And now he looked like an idiot hiding in his own apartment.</p><p>Just act normal.</p><p>Just act like nothing you did was weird.</p><p>Taiga pushed his glasses up his nose before stepping out from behind the pillar and into the kitchen, crossing his arms to give himself the poise to believe he still had the upper hand in the situation.</p><p>"... Not really."</p><p>Hokuto acted like he hadn't seen anything.</p><p>"I thought you were only going to come out once dinner was ready," Hokuto said as he lifted the cutting board to bring to the stove. "Was there something you needed?"</p><p>Taiga adjusted his feet, shifting his weight to the other foot to appear unbothered as his brain panicked internally. </p><p>"If I needed something from my own home, I wouldn't need to ask you."</p><p>Hokuto just chuckled as he loaded a dutch oven Taiga didn't know he owned with the cut vegetables. "I guess you're right."</p><p>Without anything left to say, the room fell silent as it was occupied only by the sounds of the sizzling of the pot.</p><p>Things had certainly turned awkward.</p><p>Well, it felt awkward to Taiga at least as he stood there, trying to stay irritated at Hokuto after his very reasonable response.</p><p>His best option now seemed to be just looking at his hands and acting like studying his nails was intensely interesting until the right amount of time had passed for him to slip away back inside his room.</p><p>The moment Hokuto faced away to place what Taiga could only describe as "meat" with "some other kind of meat" in the pot, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally sneak away.</p><p>Taiga could already feel relief wash over him as he turned, his bedroom door in his sight, but before the feeling of freedom could settle Hokuto called at his back, making his body freeze.</p><p>"Since you're here, do you want to try a little?"</p><p>Taiga slowly turned back to see Hokuto holding one of his bowls over a pot he hadn't noticed before.</p><p>As he stared at the bowl in Hokuto's hand, the gears in his head started to churn.</p><p>… What was the right move here? </p><p>Accept it and eat here? Take it and go back to his room? Not take it at all? </p><p>But after thinking about the offering just a moment too long, his stomach squeezed.</p><p>He was pretty hungry… and it did smell pretty good…</p><p>Letting his hunger defeat his better judgment one more time couldn't be all that bad, right?</p><p>"... Sure."</p><p>Hokuto nodded and smiled at Taiga's response before going back to the pot to fill the small bowl with a ladle while Taiga feigned reluctance and sat down at his seat at the kitchen island.</p><p>As Hokuto gave him the bowl, Taiga couldn't help but notice how Hokuto chose to move up beside him to create intimacy instead of simply reaching across the counter to place the dish in front of him.</p><p>It was the same thing he had seen him do in the restaurant before.</p><p>Taiga leaned away when Hokuto leaned in to set the spoon beside the bowl.</p><p>This is why he should have said no to the food.</p><p>Damn his gluttony.</p><p>He kept his eyes on the soup and slowly took up the spoon as Hokuto leaned his side against the edge of the counter, tilting his head down to unsuccessfully catch Taiga's gaze. </p><p>Taiga's thumb nearly turned white as his hand made a death grip on the spoon when he felt Hokuto's hand place on the center of his back.</p><p>Hokuto's voice was smooth as it always was.</p><p>"Your first course."</p><p>Ugh…</p><p>Taiga quickly planted his hand on Hokuto's chest to shove him away, making him and the hand on his back return to its owner.</p><p>"Don't you have cooking to do or something?..."</p><p>Hokuto smiled, returning to the stove to open the oven below it.</p><p>"You're right. My apologies."</p><p>Taiga gave Hokuto's back one last glare before looking back down at the contents of the bowl before him.</p><p>No matter what, food never looked quite as graceful when placed in his own dollar store bowls. Even with the sprinkling of garnish on the top.</p><p>The soup looked simple. </p><p>The surface was a solid orangey red color and held a thick consistency as it slowly fell from his lifted spoon.</p><p>Honestly, it just looked like tomato soup and when Taiga put the first spoonful into his mouth, his thought was confirmed. </p><p>It was tomato soup. It just wasn't the type of tomato soup he was familiar with. </p><p>Taiga had his fair share of run-ins with this particular dish. He was rather fond of tomatoes so the thought of a tomato based soup always piqued his interest, but every time he finished a bowl, it was never as good as he had anticipated.</p><p>But this one.</p><p>This one was different.</p><p>The usual sour flavor that Taiga had grown used to was balanced with a cream base, making it easier on the tongue without obscuring the taste of the fresh tomatoes Hokuto had selected this morning. The slight hint of spice made the soup surprisingly dimensional along with the added croutons placed on top, providing a contrasting texture to disrupt the potentially monotonous blended dish. </p><p>It was delicious.</p><p>Taiga kind of wished he had more to complain about. </p><p>He cleared his throat and settled his spoon loudly in his bowl as if he hadn't absolutely enjoyed himself before speaking in a stern tone that didn't reflect his actual feelings. "Isn't this just tomato soup?... I can just get this from a can in a store. I thought you would be making something more extravagant for working at a French restaurant." </p><p>Hokuto glanced at him from over his shoulder before turning to face him with a bowl and whisk in hand. </p><p>"Well actually, it's tomato bisque," Hokuto said as he continued quickly whipping the contents inside the bowl.</p><p>"What's tomato bisque?..."</p><p>"It's basically tomato soup."</p><p>"... Are you making fun of me?"</p><p>Hokuto laughed as he tested the peaks of his mixture. "Just a little." </p><p>"But I'd love to know where you get your tomato soup. It would save Jesse and I a lot of time."</p><p>Taiga frowned.</p><p>He could tell Hokuto knew that he was lying about finding the same soup in a can. Even though he was the one who told the lie in the first place, it didn't stop Taiga from being annoyed by it anyway.</p><p>Taiga clenched his jaw as he looked back down at his bowl, trying not to appear irritated as he scraped up the bare amount of soup that stuck to the sides with his spoon to place back in his mouth before a sweet scent touched his nose.</p><p>Just from the smell alone, Taiga knew what the thick dark fluid he saw Hokuto pouring was.</p><p>"Chocolate?..."</p><p>Hokuto took his spatula to smoothly scrape the walls of the bowl to move all of it into his wisp.</p><p>"Mhm."</p><p>Taiga tilted his head questioningly as he held up his spoon to idly bite between his teeth. "You're making dessert now?... Have you even finished making the rest of the meal?"</p><p>"No, not yet."</p><p>Taiga stared at Hokuto as he turned the bowl in his hand, rhythmically rounding and folding the once yellow colored foam in with the chocolate.</p><p>"... Are you not understanding the problem here?"</p><p>"I do. Can you bring me the two glasses by the sink?"</p><p>Taiga blinked as he set down his spoon and slipped out of his chair, his eyes lingering on  Hokuto's back before quickly taking the wide short stemmed glasses to place at the counter next to Hokuto.</p><p>"Can you hold one up, please?"</p><p>Taiga didn't know why he didn't hesitate to follow Hokuto's request. </p><p>His best guess was that he just assumed that everything with cooking had to be done quickly and in a timely manner or something like 'popping the soufflé' could ruin the whole thing.</p><p>He didn't even question the way Hokuto placed his hand over his to guide him tilt the glass as Hokuto filled it to the brim with the airy dessert.</p><p>"I have to prepare the mousse early because it has to chill." Hokuto gently pulled the spatula over the lip of the cup. "It's not about the order that the dishes will be eaten, but when they will be ready to be served."</p><p>Taiga just silently watched the glass become dark with the brown color as the mousse was evenly spread within it before being cleanly scraped to reveal a satisfyingly smooth top.</p><p>"Next, please."</p><p>Taiga set down the glass to trade it for the other, which this time, Hokuto took from his hand to hold by his own. </p><p>Taiga still peered over his arm as he filled the second cup.</p><p>"If I had started the mousse after finishing the main course, dessert wouldn't have been midnight. Or dinner would have gone cold waiting for it."</p><p>As Hokuto placed down the second glass, Taiga's gaze that had been on the dessert caught on the familiar gold bracelet around Hokuto's wrist before following up until it met with the eyes that looked over to him.</p><p>Taiga's body tensed when he saw Hokuto's lips curl into a smile, only now noticing their shoulders were close enough to bump.</p><p>"I can't keep the customer waiting, can I?"</p><p>A shudder shot up his back as Taiga made a large side step away, creating ample distance between them before he rubbed the back of his hand in a very delayed response to Hokuto's touch.</p><p>His glasses clattered as he shoved up the heavy frames. "Sure. Yeah. I guess that makes sense."</p><p>"I knew it would," Hokuto said as he moved past him to place the cups into the fridge.</p><p>Things were already going off kilter.</p><p>"... Can I go back to my room now?..."</p><p>Hokuto let out a short laugh. "You can do whatever you want. It's your home, but everything is just about done if you would like to officially have your first course."</p><p>Taiga scratched at his hand, still feeling the crawling on his skin.</p><p>At this point, it didn't matter. </p><p>Somehow, even when he was in his own apartment, Hokuto had still managed to get the upper hand and close the distance between them.</p><p>Hokuto had already been able to flirt with him as he desperately tried to avoid. If the point was to have a horrible time, then he should just let Hokuto do whatever he wants. After all, his flirting and intimacy was by far the worst part of all of it. </p><p>In the sense of the deal, that was a good thing.</p><p>Terrible date. No more Hokuto.</p><p>It's not like he was going to get any writing done in the however many minutes he had anyways.</p><p>He might as well just eat.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Taiga sat back down as Hokuto refilled his bowl with a larger serving than just the taste he provided before.</p><p>Even the second time, the soup was amazingly delicious, especially with the side of bread Hokuto provided along with it to clean the bowl.</p><p>When Hokuto placed down a wine glass with a bottle beside it, Taiga didn't refuse, figuring that if he was going to last through the night, he might as well enjoy the food and drink.</p><p>Hokuto worked as he ate, removing the pot from the oven and releasing a deep savory smell as heat spilled into the room. </p><p>Taiga did his best to keep his eyes down on his food, frustrated with the way his gaze frequently stuck on Hokuto's back and his hands as he cooked. He only raised his head when a plate entered his view as Hokuto turned it on the counter, orientating the presentation appropriately for Taiga's view.</p><p>"Your main course." </p><p>Immediately, the smell of alcohol hit his nose. It was pungent, but not in a way that was unpleasant. The long baked dish had allowed the alcohol to cook out from the stew that was poured over the chicken and the bed of mashed potatoes it was propped against, leaving only the detailed flavors of the drink behind. The herbs and fragrant vegetables aided the scent of the whole dish, making Taiga's mouth water as Hokuto slipped a fork and knife into his hands.</p><p>"Enjoy."</p><p>And enjoy Taiga did.</p><p>The flavor lived up to its smell as it spread over his tongue. The chicken was tender and was soaked in the deep wine flavor, elevating its taste that matched perfectly with the sauce and vegetables served with it. The heavy sauce balanced wonderfully with the silky smooth potatoes as Taiga ate them together, tasting just the hint of butter that was blended in. It would have also been a crime to excuse the roasted carrots and beets as simply a side as they were just as wonderful on their own. The sugars in the root vegetables had been caramelized, bringing out the flavor that made them truly delicious.</p><p>Even the wine was perfectly paired as it woke the flavors of the cooked brandy and hearty red the meat was cooked with. </p><p>"Do you like it?" </p><p>Taiga looked up at Hokuto across from him, his apron now removed and clutched in his hand as he watched him eat.</p><p>"It's okay" was what Taiga wanted to say. "It's alright. I've had something like this before" was what Taiga wished he could have said. </p><p>He couldn't lie. </p><p>Not when it was this amazing.</p><p>"It's um…" Taiga said as he looked back down at the half eaten dish.</p><p>"It's really good." </p><p>As an author, he should have had more eloquent ways to express his enjoyment of the dish, but base level words came stumbling out of his mouth.</p><p>Well, sometimes basic words were what described some things the best.</p><p>It was good. </p><p>It was just simply good.</p><p>Hokuto smiled as Taiga took another bite, absorbing himself back in his food. He watched as Taiga carefully separated the bone from the breast before covering it in the thick sauce and chasing it with a fork full of potatoes mixed with the braised vegetables. He stayed quiet, not wanting to interrupt Taiga's delight that was only broken when Taiga asked for another serving, which Hokuto gladly gave.</p><p>Taiga looked at the empty space on the other side of the table as he blindly cut into the extra drumstick that was given to him while Hokuto closed the lid of the pot.</p><p>"... Are you not going to eat?"</p><p>Hokuto raised an eyebrow as he dried his hands on a towel.</p><p>"I wasn't sure you wanted me to eat with you. I kind of figured you would want to eat alone."</p><p>He wasn't wrong.</p><p>But Taiga wasn't mean enough to make a man starve after slaving over a stove for him.</p><p>"It's weird eating by myself with you just standing there…" Taiga muttered as he poked at his food. </p><p>"Just eat."</p><p>Hokuto watched him as Taiga took another bite of his potatoes. </p><p>He hid his smile behind his turned back as he got himself a plate from the shelf.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>The glass of water Hokuto set down beside his plate caught Taiga’s attention as he swallowed down his last bite. </p><p>"... You're not going to have wine?"</p><p>"The wine is for you. I'll have some if you let me, but I wasn't planning on it," Hokuto said before placing a strip of chicken into his mouth.</p><p>Taiga sighed, getting up to bring Hokuto a glass. "Just have some."</p><p>"Thank you," Hokuto chuckled as he held down the base of it for Taiga to fill.</p><p>Taiga slipped back into his chair to take his fork and knife again. </p><p>Both of them kept their eyes on their plates as they talked. </p><p>"Are you not going to have soup either?"</p><p>"No, I won't be having soup." </p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"I don't like tomatoes."</p><p>Taiga nearly choked before he washed it down with wine.</p><p>"Huh?... Why not?"</p><p>"It's just a taste I never got used to."</p><p>"So then how do you know how to make tomato sou-, I mean, bisque."</p><p>"It's Jesse's recipe. That's the only one I borrowed today."</p><p>"So then why did you make it?"</p><p>"You like tomatoes, don't you?"</p><p>Taiga's hand froze before his fork reached his lips, his open mouth closing as he looked over at Hokuto.</p><p>As far as he could remember, he never told Hokuto what he liked. After all, they didn't have that many conversations between them outside of their misfortunate occasions together. It wasn't that Hokuto was stalking him, was it? No, there was no way he could know even if he did. Taiga really didn't go anywhere besides his own apartment anyways. </p><p>"I do…" Taiga answered. </p><p>Hokuto set down his fork to take a sip of his wine. "You sound concerned."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Do you remember what you ordered when you first came to Salut?"</p><p>"No… It was a busy day…"</p><p>The most Taiga could remember from that day was the agony of being forced to go outside and that night being the start date of his deadline. The food he had that day was a rather insignificant memory in comparison. </p><p>It was also the first day he had met Hokuto.</p><p>But that fact wasn't important.</p><p>"I remember," Hokuto said as he lowered his glass. "You had the gratin de tomates while the miss had the salmon."</p><p>"The second time, you had the chicken confit with cherry clafoutis."</p><p>"...... I do this with everyone. Don't worry."</p><p>Hokuto must have seen Taiga’s physical retraction when he recited his orders. His posture relaxed a little after Hokuto's clarifications, but his hands still rubbed up and down his arms to ease the goosebumps that raised on his skin.</p><p>"You remember every customer's orders? Isn't that kind of crazy? There's no way you memorize all of them, right? Do you write it down or something?" Taiga tried to not come off as judgmental or condescending in his tone, but he couldn't stop the slight raise in his voice that was, if not rude, possibly irate. </p><p>There was just no way that Hokuto could memorize those details. </p><p>Hokuto didn't appear to mind as he continued his dinner as usual. </p><p>"No, I just remember some and sometimes others I don't. I try to remember the most I can, but I don't make a big deal out of it if I forget."</p><p>At this point, Taiga hadn't eaten any more of his extra serving. His hands had stilled as he stared at Hokuto across from him in utter awe.</p><p>"So then why bother?..."</p><p>Hokuto smiled to himself as he cut into his carrots.</p><p>"Even if I only remember one customer's favorite food, it can make that one person's day better."</p><p>Taiga watched Hokuto split the rest of his chicken and potatoes into his last bites as Taiga sat in stunned silence.</p><p>He didn't get it.</p><p>He didn't get Hokuto at all.</p><p>It just didn’t seem worth it. All that work just to maybe, on the off chance, give someone momentary happiness just because a stranger remembered their order. </p><p>It seemed like a waste of effort. Why should someone give so much of themselves with no promise of return? There wasn't even any assurance that they would appreciate it. It could all just be brushed off as trivial lip service or even, like himself, feel vaguely disturbing. </p><p>It just wasn't worth giving a piece of yourself to someone who wouldn't give you the light of day.</p><p>"Are you done?"</p><p>Taiga blinked, not realizing he had been lost in his own thoughts. </p><p>When he looked down at his plate, the bare piece of bone and the smeared bit of what was left of his potatoes felt less appealing than it was a few minutes ago.</p><p>He pushed his plate towards Hokuto to take. </p><p>"Yeah, I'm done."</p><p>The kitchen grew quiet as Taiga aimlessly gazed into his glass, rolling the stem between his fingers as what was left of his drink spun and swirled at the center. Only the soft clatter of dishes and running water played as background music to Taiga's racing mind.</p><p>"... Are you still thinking about it?" Hokuto asked gently as dried his hands to open the fridge.</p><p>Taiga lied as he drank what was left in his cup.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Hokuto just smiled as he set the mousse onto the table before gliding it over to set before Taiga. </p><p>"You know, cuisine has its own language."</p><p>The prints from Hokuto’s fingers remained on the base of the frosted glass after he drew his hand away to untie a small cloth bundle he had brought with him. </p><p>Taiga kept silent, watching from over his empty drink as Hokuto took the steel tool from inside the wrap and cradled the smooth chocolate block in his hand, still delicately handling it with the cloth around it.</p><p>"Just remembering what someone likes or what someone loves to cook for them is a thousand words."</p><p>The tool ran smoothly over the top, creating dark curls that fell perfectly onto the chilled dessert. </p><p>"Many descriptions of foods are also used for emotions." </p><p>Hokuto set down the sweet and it's shaver to tie up neatly again.</p><p>"Bitterness."</p><p>"Sourness."</p><p>"Savory."</p><p>"Sweet."</p><p>"In the same way lilies mean purity and roses mean love, food can speak too."</p><p>He placed a slender spoon next to the picturesque glass, filled to the brim with the smooth dark cream Taiga had helped him plate before.</p><p>"Mousse au chocolat," Hokuto spoke softly.</p><p>"Your dessert."</p><p>Taiga didn't know he had been holding his breath as he stared at his last course.</p><p>As graceful as Hokuto's presentation was, Taiga roughly took the spoon, his fingers fumbling, making it clatter against the counter before holding it firmly and unceremoniously cutting into the center. </p><p>The mousse was rich and sweet but had a delicacy in its cloud-like texture. The bitterness of the dark chocolate on top broke up the sweetness of the mousse as it melted onto his tongue and the edge of his lip.</p><p>Taiga dug the spoon in the mousse again.</p><p>"Teach me."</p><p>Hokuto blinked, his hands frozen and still damp with the cloth held in them after washing off the traces of chocolate. </p><p>"... Huh?"</p><p>The light dessert gathered at the end of Taiga's spoon as he scraped it up the sharp cliff he had formed before placing it back into his mouth.</p><p>"Teach you what?..."</p><p>"I don't know." Taiga spoke past the spoon between his lips. "How to cook. How you see food. Any of that."</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure. He wasn't even sure what he was really asking.</p><p>He just knew he didn't understand. </p><p>He didn't understand anything about cooking, food, its hidden language, or cuisine to the point where it was almost foreign. </p><p>He didn't understand anything about Hokuto either.</p><p>But anything he didn't know was something he could learn. </p><p>Something new.</p><p>Something different.</p><p>"Just teach me."</p><p>Hokuto raised an eyebrow before he leaned over the counter, his arms folded and propped at his waist. </p><p>"Are you going to pay me?"</p><p>Taiga scowled and took a moment to think before taking a large scoop of the mousse. </p><p>Hokuto shifted back in surprise as Taiga held out the spoon to him.</p><p>"Your payment."</p><p>Hokuto laughed. "You're going to pay me with the food that I made you?"</p><p>"Take it or don't take it, your choice."</p><p>Taiga flinched when Hokuto laid his hand over his as Hokuto leaned in.</p><p>He didn't realize he was staring at Hokuto's lips as they separated to accept the spoonful of the chocolate sweet between them. </p><p>Or that he watched how Hokuto tilted his head just the slightest bit or how his eyes lidded as he led Taiga's hand.</p><p>Taiga let go of the spoon when it was tugged gently from his fingers, Hokuto pulling back with it still tucked between his teeth.</p><p>Hokuto smiled as he straightened out and pulled the spoon Taiga had been using from his lips. </p><p>"Then you can pay me next time by giving me a taste of your own."</p><p>Taiga broke his eyes away from him to look down at his unfinished dessert, now without a way to eat it.</p><p>"... Deal."</p><h6></h6><p>"Tell me again how this is going to teach me anything?"</p><p>"A lot of people find cooking inspirational from these kinds of shows. It's not a bad way to start."</p><p>Taiga sighed as he sank into his seat. "Can't you just show me how to make something?"</p><p>Hokuto crossed his legs as he leaned back, pressing down on the play button on the remote to begin the first episode. "I can show you next time, but I don't have anything prepared. I only brought as much as I needed to cook the meal today."</p><p>The two of them sat on Taiga's couch, both of them at either end of the seat as the show began to play with a grandiose fanfare to open what was presented to be a heated competition.</p><p>Reality TV, huh?...</p><p>Taiga had heard about these competitive cooking shows but never bothered to take the time to watch one. They just never seemed interesting. </p><p>After turning down the lights, he toed off his slippers to tuck his knees to his chest as he curled into the corner of his couch, leaning his head against the arm rest.</p><p>"Do you watch these often?"</p><p>Hokuto placed the remote between the two of them as the announcer began to present the judges in an intimidating manner, layered with the ominous deep music. </p><p>"Sometimes," he said as rested his cheek against his knuckles. "But there's so many of them, they're hard to keep up with."</p><p>"So this one is your favorite?"</p><p>"It's one of the better ones."</p><p>Taiga sighed to himself as he focused back on the TV. </p><p>Well, whatever. </p><p>Hokuto said that his next payment would be a mousse he made himself so he figured Hokuto would teach him eventually, but he guessed just a TV show for now would do.</p><p>As the episodes went on, Taiga’s skepticism and doubt slowly morphed into curiosity and intrigue before becoming completely invested by the 4th episode.</p><p>It was fascinating the lengths people would go to to maintain their chance at a life changing amount of money. </p><p>People cried, screamed and broke down from just their roast getting burnt and their dressings turning too sour. </p><p>From time to time Taiga would ask Hokuto questions about the food. Why did the cream curdle or how did the bread become crispy on the outside but stay completely raw in the middle. For the most part, Hokuto always had an answer, describing how heat and chemical compounds create different structures in foods and by how it was done it could give a different result, but sometimes he just laughed and told him he didn't know. </p><p>Compared to the rough afternoon, the evening was rather peaceful as time washed away with each passing episode.</p><p>Hokuto glanced at his watch.</p><p>"It's getting late. Do you still want to watch more?"</p><p>Taiga pulled out the blanket that was folded in a basket under the cluttered coffee table. "Do you have work tomorrow?"</p><p>"We open late."</p><p>"Then keep going."</p><p>Hokuto didn't question it as he pressed play again.</p><p>After another episode and a half, Hokuto noticed he hadn't received a question in a while.</p><p>He looked over to Taiga who was bundled up in his blanket with the lengths of his blinks becoming longer and longer, indicating his approaching slumber.</p><p>"... Do you want to go to sleep?" Hokuto asked softly as Taiga stirred before stretching his arms above his head.</p><p>"No. I want to finish this one. I can stay awake."</p><p>"Do you want to use my shoulder?" </p><p>Hokuto was joking for the most part. He didn't really think Taiga would accept though if he had, he wouldn't have minded. </p><p>He just didn't expect Taiga to throw a cushion on his lap and for him to drop his head on top of it.</p><p>Hokuto was speechless as he uncrossed his legs to let the cushion lay flat, watching Taiga pull his blanket back over his shoulders.</p><p>"I usually watch TV like this," Taiga mumbled as he fixed his glasses with his blanket wrapped hand. "You're just in the way." </p><p>Despite being out of Taiga’s view, Hokuto turned his head as he covered his mouth with his hand. </p><p>He just couldn't stop the smile that tugged at his lips.</p><p>Once fighting back his grin, he placed his arms on the back of the couch and along its rest, keeping his hands away from the other borrowing his lap. </p><p>It was hard to focus on the TV, but thankfully, he had already seen this episode.</p><p>He let Taiga use him as if he was just another pillow on the couch, keeping still as the show went on, only checking on him once the credits began to roll and there was no voice insisting on continuing on with another.</p><p>"Kyomoto?..."</p><p>Hokuto looked down to his lap where Taiga lay.</p><p>As expected, he was dead asleep.</p><p>His glasses were crooked on his nose as his dark hair fell over his closed eyes, his breath slow and even as he slept comfortably in his lap.</p><p>Hokuto whispered as he carefully brushed back Taiga's hair, smoothing it gently behind his ear. </p><p>"... You have no idea, do you?…" </p><p>Naturally, Hokuto received no response.</p><p>The TV flashed off, leaving the room dim with only the warm glow from the kitchen light as Hokuto carefully leaned over the other to leave the remote on top of one of the many stacks of books.</p><p>"Let's get you to bed."</p><p>Taiga didn't stir as Hokuto gently set his hand under his neck, cradling it to remove the cushion from between them before easing Taiga's body up against him to rest his head against his shoulder.</p><p>In one easy movement, Hokuto slipped his arms around Taiga's shoulders and under his knees to lift him from the couch and into his arms, keeping him bundled in his blanket.</p><p>He brought him through the doorway Taiga peeked through before, correctly guessing it was his bedroom and carefully laid him into his bed, adjusting the blanket around him for his sleep.</p><p>Once Taiga was comfortably placed in his bed, Hokuto kneeled down beside him and slowly removed his glasses from his nose, revealing the long lashes that Hokuto had noticed before. He couldn't stop himself from reaching out and barely running the back of his fingers over his cheeks as he admired them for just a moment too long.</p><p>Taiga's clock ticked steadily in the quiet room. </p><p>Hokuto's jaw tensed as he drew his hand away and placed Taiga's folded glasses on his bedside.</p><p>"Maybe I'm becoming greedy…"</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga's eyes cracked open as he inhaled deeply to fill his lungs, stretching his shoulders before running his fingers through his hair to move the disheveled strands from his face.</p><p>He let out the long breath before he paused.</p><p>Something was off.</p><p>"... Hm?"</p><p>He shot up in bed as his hands blindly patted his chest, feeling his clothes from yesterday and the throw from his living room that was on his lap from the night before.</p><p>The morning call of birds sounded through his window as he squinted through his blurry vision.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He fell asleep.</p><p>Taiga squeezed his eyes shut, the drowsiness still lingering in his head as he recalled what he could remember last.</p><p>He was watching TV and he had laid down on the couch.</p><p>One way or another, he had gotten here whether it was with Hokuto’s help or the wine had removed the memory of returning to his room from his head. </p><p>Which one it was didn’t really matter as long as he made it back somehow.</p><p>Taiga yawned, figuring he might as well go back to sleep, but as he started to pull the blanket back over himself, he froze.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Hokuto.</p><p>He didn't see him leave his apartment.</p><p>He fell asleep with Hokuto still in his home. </p><p>Taiga jolted out of bed, his hand scrambling to snatch his glasses as he got on his feet to speed walk to his bedroom door.</p><p>It's not that he thought that Hokuto had done anything bad, it's just that he didn't know what Hokuto would do. </p><p>Hokuto could have done anything and he wouldn't be surprised. Nothing about that man made any sense to him. </p><p>By his most sensical logic, Hokuto would have just gone home once Taiga fell asleep. That's what normal people would do. That's what Kochi would have done if it were him instead.</p><p>But Hokuto wasn't normal, at least not to Taiga. </p><p>So of course when Taiga opened his door, Hokuto was in his kitchen with the smell of freshly cooked rice and miso soup filling the room.</p><p>Hokuto glanced over his shoulder to see Taiga fixing his glasses with his hand still and the handle of his door with an expression of disbelief.</p><p>"You're awake," Hokuto smiled before turning back to the stove. "I wondered when you would wake up."</p><p>"... You're still here?" </p><p>"I slept on the couch. Is that alright?"</p><p>Taiga was on the fence on whether he was actually upset about Hokuto staying over or not, but the smell of the miso that met him when he reached the kitchen swayed him. </p><p>"It's fine…" Taiga said quietly as he went to peek into the pot Hokuto was watching.</p><p>"... So you make Japanese food too?"</p><p>Hokuto laughed lightly. "Well, I am Japanese after all."</p><p>When he glanced over at Taiga, he was staring intently into the pot. </p><p>"... Are you curious what I put in?"</p><p>Taiga nodded. </p><p>"There wasn't much… You probably already know there isn't a lot to work with in the fridge. Miso was about all I could find along with some leftover tofu which I didn't think you would mind me using."</p><p>"I also used the potatoes from yesterday's dinner. There was just a bit left so I figured I'd add them in." As the ladle lifted from the cloudy soup, Taiga could see the pale cubes bob up for a moment before sinking back down into the miso.</p><p>"It's too bad that you don't have any eggs… Tamagoyaki would go well with the miso and rice."</p><p>Taiga shifted over to look at how much time was left on the rice cooker. "There's a convenient store at the corner of the next block…"</p><p>"... Are you asking me to go pick up some eggs?"</p><p>Hokuto took Taiga's silence as a yes. After all, no one needed that long to understand that the digital "5 M" on the rice cooker meant that there was 5 minutes left.</p><p>"Could you tell me what the lobby door code is?"</p><p>"I have it written down on the paper on the door side table." Taiga pointed over at the entrance.</p><p>Hokuto nodded a thanks before going to the door to slip on his shoes.</p><p>"When the soup begins to boil, turn down the heat to low to keep it warm. I shouldn't be out long," Hokuto said as he slung his bag across his shoulders.</p><p>He grabbed the slip and opened the door.</p><p>"I'll be back soon."</p><p>As Hokuto waved, Taiga waved back, immediately feeling ridiculous when the door closed.</p><p>His hand stilled before dropping down to his side as he turned back to the pot, watching the streams of miso rise and swirl at the top.</p><p>… What was he doing?...</p><p>Not that long ago, Hokuto was the last man he wanted to see on earth, but now he was asking him to teach him how to cook. The whole point of Hokuto coming over was for Taiga could claim he had a bad date so that Hokuto would leave him alone. </p><p>He couldn't say that now that he needed Hokuto.</p><p>He also couldn't say that he didn't have a good time. </p><p>He needed this.</p><p>This was the best chance he had finding something for his book. Nothing thus far had engrossed him as much as watching Hokuto cook and how he saw his food. It was a lead he couldn't give up.</p><p>He pulled his hood over his head.</p><p>Maybe if he just didn't say anything, Hokuto would forget. </p><p>…</p><p>……</p><p>… Just how long did it take for something to boil? </p><p>The rice cooker had already sung its short tune to announce that its job was done but the soup still had yet to boil. </p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>"Coming!" Taiga shouted, watching the soup for one last second to make sure he didn't miss the moment bubbles began to rise.</p><p>Taiga walked to the door and pulled it open, eyes still on the pot behind him, despite not being able to see the surface of the soup.</p><p>"You were quick. Did you-"</p><p>When Hokuto rounded the corner of the hallway, the plastic bag from the store in hand, he saw a man in a sharp suit at Taiga's door with Taiga standing in front of him, mouth open in shock. </p><p>Taiga's grip tightened on the handle as his mouth closed.</p><p>"Did you miss me, Kyomo?"</p><p>The soup began to boil.</p><p>"... Juri."</p>

  <p>"Hey, you're the one who wrote the poem in the school newsletter, right?"</p><p>Taiga looked up from his homework and textbook to see a tall slender man standing before his table.</p><p>"... Um… Yeah. Why?"</p><p>The man took the seat across from him with a wide grin on his face as he dropped his chin in his palm.</p><p>"It was really good! The words you chose made it beautiful. I'm surprised how much it moved me. Are you a writing major?"</p><p>Taiga's eyes returned to his papers, already becoming irritated from a stranger inviting himself to his table without permission.</p><p>"No…" Taiga muttered as he pushed up his glasses. "I'm in theater and cinema studies."</p><p>"My professor submitted the poem for me."</p><p>"My studies have nothing to do with creative writing, but it's important to understand script writing for film. Now, please, let me continue my work already-"</p><p>Taiga flinched when hands were placed around his own, stopping his writing and forcing him to meet the gaze of the man who grew closer as he leaned across the table.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>The heavy frames on Taiga's nose slipped.</p><p>"W-what?..."</p><p>His hand felt warm wrapped inside his.</p><p>"Have you ever considered writing romance?"</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga met Tanaka Juri in college in his 3rd year.</p><p>He was a Theater/Cinema Studies major.</p><p>Juri was in Literature.</p><p>Juri asked him to write a story.</p><p>The rest was history.</p><p>Now, many years later, Juri was smiling, his face sharper with his old colored hair gone and replaced with a sleek black made for a professional as he stood in Taiga's doorway.</p><p>"Can I come in?"</p><p>"Ah- uh-" Taiga started before remembering the soup, his head whipping around to glance at the stove.</p><p>"Yeah. Uh- hold on."</p><p>As Taiga ran to the kitchen to turn down the flame, the chime of the elevator arriving sounded through the hall.</p><p>"Juri?"</p><p>The man in question turned, his face illuminating once seeing who walked towards him.</p><p>"Oh! Hokuto! What are you doing here?" He grinned as he gave Hokuto a strong pat on the shoulder.</p><p>"I came ov-"</p><p>"He's just visiting!" Taiga shouted over Hokuto as if the truth would have damned him.</p><p>Juri would have just laughed at the details, but it really wasn't the first thing Taiga wanted to tell him after so long.</p><p>He forced a smile as he quickly went to hold the door open.</p><p>"Come inside. Let's all have breakfast."</p><p>"Sounds great," Juri grinned, undoing a button on his suit as Taiga stepped back to let them both inside.</p><p>"Why didn't you say you were coming over?" Taiga asked as he shut the door behind them.</p><p>"Also, why aren't you in Osaka?"</p><p>Juri walked in as if he had been there millions of times, waving his hand as he looked over the mess of books and papers strewn about the living room. "I wanted to surprise you! And don't worry about that. Let's eat first."</p><p>"It already smells great. Is this your work, Hokuto?"</p><p>"Mhm. I'm about to make some tamagoyaki as well."</p><p>"It's been a while since I've had your food. I'm excited!"</p><p>Hokuto was already cracking eggs into a bowl in the kitchen while Juri laughed and threw his suit jacket over the back of the couch. They conversed casually, Taiga's eyes darted back and forth between the visitors in his home as he was lost for words.</p><p>What the hell was going on?...</p><p>"Um…"</p><p>The two of them turned to look over to Taiga who was still stood at the front door.</p><p>"Do you two… know… each other?..."</p><p>As odd as it was for them to both hardly react to the presence of another person, it was even more strange that both of them acted as if the other was meant to be there. Juri's sudden arrival was already shocking and this just layered onto Taiga's bafflement.</p><p>Juri grinned as he took wide steps to grab Taiga's arm and dislodge his feet that were seemingly glued to the floor as he pushed him to the kitchen.</p><p>"We've known each other since high school," Juri said, leading him with his hands on Taiga's back. "We got in a lot of trouble together back then."</p><p>Hokuto tapped his chopsticks against the side of his bowl as Juri accepted Taiga's offer of coffee. "It's more like you got me in trouble. It was all your decision to put shock pens in the teachers' office supplies."</p><p>"But you didn't say no to holding the door open while I did it, did you?"</p><p>Hokuto switched on the stove. "I guess not."</p><p>Juri thanked Taiga as he set the mug next to him on the counter. When Taiga returned with bowls of rice and soup for the three of them, Juri beckoned him to sit beside him. As Taiga sat down, Juri rested his hand on the back of Taiga's chair as he leaned into the table, propping his elbow on it.</p><p>"So."</p><p>"I see you're still struggling with writing a manuscript."</p><p>Taiga sipped his coffee as Juri looked past him to the mess that was his living room.</p><p>"They told you?"</p><p>"Them and the piles of books over there, but that's why I'm here."</p><p>Juri smiled, his cheek resting on his knuckles as Taiga peered at him over his mug.</p><p>Taiga sighed into his drink, the steam fogging his glasses. "Are you also going to force me to write a romance novel?"</p><p>"Not necessarily. But they called me because I was the one who got you to do it last time," Juri said softly as he placed his hand on Taiga's shoulder, giving it an encouraging rub before settling his hand on his lower back.</p><p>"I'm just here to support you."</p><p>They both raised their heads when a plate clattered loudly onto the table.</p><p>"The tamagoyaki is done," Hokuto smiled, standing across from them with the edge of the dish still at the ends of his fingers.</p><p>"Shall we eat?"</p><p>The three of them said their thanks before beginning their meal.</p><p>All of it tasted amazing. Taiga had never seen or tasted a tamagoyaki that was so fluffy and soft. Even the miso soup was amazing with the added smoothness from the potatoes that he would have never thought would change a simple soup so much. It took a lot to make a miso soup truly bad, but that just meant it took a lot to make it extraordinary too and somehow Hokuto managed to achieve that. The rice also made a delicious pairing as the texture was perfectly balanced between wet and dry.</p><p>Taiga ate, stubbornly holding back how joyous he was as they talked, slowly catching up on their lost time with their friend from Osaka while sharing breakfast. When Taiga saw Juri stop eating before his plate was empty, he wasn't surprised. Juri didn't eat much. He never did as he chose to fill himself with black coffee and cigarettes. It always made Taiga feel like a glutton swallowing down his lunch while Juri did as much as eat air.</p><p>But it was nice to have his friend here, whether Taiga really acknowledged it or not.</p><p>There was a sort of satisfaction that he hadn't felt in a long time as he sat next to his friend and his bright smile.</p><p>"You're moving back here?" Hokuto asked as he watched Juri move a cut of tamagoyaki from his plate to Taiga's.</p><p>"Not yet. I'm just renting a place for now," Juri said as he set down his chopsticks and leaned back in his chair. "For now, I'm just here to watch him."</p><p>He tapped the back of his hand against Taiga's shoulder as Taiga took the extra slice and ate it without question.</p><p>"It's this a little below your pay grade?..." Taiga mumbled as he picked up his bowl of soup to raise to his lips. "You're a chief editor in Osaka. Chasing after authors isn't really in your job description anymore."</p><p>"Well, I can't exactly complain about getting paid more to do less," Juri laughed. "Either way, I've been training someone for a while that can pick up my slack while I do the rest remotely. My team will be fine."</p><p>"Also, aren't you excited about seeing me again? It'll just be like the old days."</p><p>Taiga didn't respond as he drank his soup, only to have Juri chuckle and give his arm a squeeze before looking down at his watch that was far more expensive than what Taiga had ever seen him wear before.</p><p>"I better get going. I was only able to slip away for a moment before I go say my greetings at the Tokyo office," Juri said as he fixed his cuff. "I only wanted to drop by and let you know that I'll be checking up on you."</p><p>As Taiga saw Juri leave his seat, he hastily finished his last sip and set his bowl down to follow.</p><p>"Oh–" He swallowed. "Okay."</p><p>"Let me get the door."</p><p>Taiga sped after him to open it as Juri shrugged back on his suit jacket.</p><p>"Do you still use the same number?" Juri asked as he turned around after stepping through the doorway.</p><p>"Yeah. Should be."</p><p>"Hey, look at me."</p><p>Taiga winced, blinking as Juri nudged the bridge of his glasses back into place with the joint of his finger before Taiga met the kind eyes he only now vividly remembered.</p><p>"I'll be back in a few days. Watch your phone, okay?"</p><p>Taiga nodded, fixing his glasses himself as he couldn't help his lips from curling up just a little.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Juri peeked through the door to wave a goodbye at Hokuto before taking his leave down the hallway, Taiga watching until he rounded the corner to shut the door.</p><p>When Taiga turned back, Hokuto was cleaning up Juri's dishes.</p><p>"Oh. Sorry. I should be doing that, not you." Taiga quickly went to the sink to take the plate from Hokuto's hand.</p><p>Hokuto shifted aside as his job was stolen from him, his hands left wet with no purpose.</p><p>"It's okay. I guess you could say I'm used to it," Hokuto laughed a little as he grabbed a towel.</p><p>"... Hey, turn to me for a second."</p><p>"Hm? Huh-? Wait! What are you-"</p><p>When Hokuto's hand did as much enter his vision, Taiga flinched back, shifting away as much as he could while keeping his soaked hands in the sink. He held still until Hokuto's blurred hand came into focus, holding a barely visible white thread between his fingers.</p><p>"I just saw something in your hair."</p><p>The sound of the running water filled the empty air before Taiga sighed and moved back to the sink</p><p>"Well. Thanks."</p><p>"You're welcome." Hokuto brushed the thread off on his pants. "Are you done eating?"</p><p>Taiga shut off the faucet and shook the water off his hands. "No, not yet."</p><p>They both sat back down, the room much more quiet with just the two of them, eating with only the sounds from their dinnerware until Hokuto was the first to break the silence.</p><p>"... Juri said that he was the one who got you to write romance before?"</p><p>For a moment, Taiga didn't respond, biting into his last tamagoyaki before chasing it with more soup as Hokuto waited patiently.</p><p>Taiga set down his empty bowl and his chopstick across his cleaned plate.</p><p>"... Yeah."</p><p>Hokuto looked down into his bowl, fishing out a cube of potato to place in his mouth. "I thought you didn't write romance."</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>Taiga stacked his empty bowls and brought them to the sink. "I wrote a short story once and now people won't leave me alone about it."</p><p>"What got you to write the last one?"</p><p>"I don't know. It was probably just some kind of fluke."</p><p>Hokuto stared at his last bite of rice.</p><p>"So what changed?..."</p><p>Taiga's hand paused on the faucet, listening to the clink of Hokuto's chopsticks as he ate the rest of his food.</p><p>The water started again, filling the bowls at the bottom.</p><p>"... I don't know."</p><p>He didn't know. It didn't matter.</p><p>Right now. At this moment. It was the last thing he wanted to write, even if it cost him his job.</p><p>Their breakfast finished quietly. Taiga washed the rest of the dishes as Hokuto taught him how to keep and reheat the leftovers of their breakfast and dinner.</p><p>"Are you sure you don't want to take any back? You made all of it after all," Taiga said as he tacked the notes he had scribbled down on the back of a crumpled failed attempt of a plotline onto his fridge.</p><p>"No. I already told you that the food was made for you." Hokuto set his utensils and pot back into one of his bags.</p><p>"It's already 9. Aren't you going to be late?" Taiga glanced at the clock, walking to the door as Hokuto heaved his bag onto his shoulder.</p><p>"It should be fine. I already brushed my teeth but I live above the restaurant so I can go down right after a quick shower."</p><p>Taiga's eyebrow raised as he propped the door open with his foot.</p><p>"... When did you brush your teeth?"</p><p>"Before you woke up. I always have one with me."</p><p>He didn't think too hard about the reason why that might be as he covered his mouth, suddenly very aware of his breath.</p><p>"Oh, could you give me your LINE?"</p><p>"Yeah," Taiga said with his hand still over his mouth as he pulled out his phone. "Let me get it."</p><p>The two of them stood at the doorway as they exchanged accounts, Hokuto looking satisfied as the name saved in his contacts.</p><p>"Text me about when you're open next week. I'll let you know when I have time."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>As Hokuto stepped out, Taiga's mind was already filling with the day's tasks, first being a shower, as he stared at their feet, not noticing the warm gaze before him.</p><p>"I'll see you soon."</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>He watched Hokuto's feet turn and walk away as he bit the inside of his cheek, the taste of the miso still lingering at the end of his tongue.</p><p>"Matsumura!"</p><p>When Hokuto turned around, he saw Taiga leaning out of the door with a crease in his brow.</p><p>"About the bet…"</p><p>For a second, Hokuto just stared at him, making Taiga's stomach twist and tense, but as soon as the corner of Hokuto's lip tugged up after a short quiet laugh escaped his chest, all of it came loose and fell apart.</p><p>"Since we're seeing each other next week, don't you think we already have our answer?"</p><p>Hokuto waved another goodbye before Taiga retreated into his home, shutting the door behind him maybe a little too briskly.</p><p>He tore off his glasses, roughly rubbing at his eyes as he hung his head.</p><p>"I need this..."</p><h6></h6><p>It felt like in the matter of days, Taiga's life had been completely flipped around.</p><p>Not in a good way.</p><p>But not in a bad way.</p><p>Just in a completely confusing way.</p><p>Hokuto came over the next week with a smile and a bag of groceries exactly as he had done before, but this time Taiga's goal was different. He welcomed Hokuto in, letting him into his home and kitchen before watching over his shoulder from start to finish.</p><p>He showered him with questions.</p><p>How do you cut mushrooms so thinly?</p><p>How can you tell the chicken is done?</p><p>When do you know the sauce is thick enough?</p><p>Do you add salt?</p><p>Do you add pepper?</p><p>When did you start cooking?</p><p>When did you start liking cooking?</p><p>What do you like to cook the most?</p><p>When it came to the questions about the food, the response Hokuto gave was usually the same.</p><p>"Experience."</p><p>Taiga didn't like that answer, knowing that experience is the result of memorizing the answer, but he didn't know enough about cooking to complain.</p><p>At least Hokuto replied to the questions about himself honestly.</p><p>He told him he cooked because he enjoyed giving people the pleasure of a full stomach and it was a bonus if they enjoyed it on the way.</p><p>It was a simple human necessity that he was able to enhance into a pleasing experience.</p><p>Taiga guessed that made sense.</p><p>He also preferred to have people enjoy his books rather than be unhappy with the story.</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"Hmm?" Taiga chimed, staring at the meat in the pan Hokuto held.</p><p>"I forgot about the mousse."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Honestly, Taiga had forgotten too after his constant inquiries which he knew were to blame for their forgotten dessert, but he wasn't about to admit that.</p><p>"Do you still want to make it?"</p><p>Taiga nodded as he moved back, letting Hokuto adjust the pan.</p><p>"It's your payment after all."</p><p>After finishing the main course, Hokuto continued on to ready the ingredients for their dessert just for Taiga to less than skillfully fumble through each step before they sat for dinner.</p><p>The escalope de veau was wonderful. Taiga had never eaten veal before and was surprised by the light and gentle flavor that was assisted amazingly by the saltiness of butter and smooth umami taste of the mushroom cream sauce.</p><p>It was too bad that the chocolate mousse they took to have as they watched TV was less than satisfying after a well made dinner.</p><p>Taiga was just glad that he was still able to call it mousse.</p><p>Even after he had seized the chocolate and over whipped the meringue, Hokuto was able to repair it enough to have the final product be vaguely enjoyable as they continued watching the same series from before, even if it was nearly as airy and was closer to a strange pudding.</p><p>Taiga had tried to watch the cooking show by himself before, but he found himself growing bored.</p><p>Without Hokuto, he just had a bunch of questions that were left unanswered, so he waited to watch it with him.</p><p>It didn't matter if Hokuto laughed after he told him.</p><p>Taiga just wanted what made the best experience for him, even at the cost of his pride.</p><p>Taiga pointed at the TV.</p><p>"How hard is it to make that?"</p><p>Hokuto tilted his head in thought.</p><p>"A pot roast?... It's not too difficult. Why? Do you want to try it?"</p><p>"Are you open tomorrow?"</p><p>Taiga didn't see Hokuto's surprised glance as he kept his eyes on the screen.</p><p>"What time?"</p><p>"Is 7:30 okay?"</p><p>"If it has to be a pot roast, then 7 might not work. Pot roast usually takes several hours to cook. It can't be any earlier?"</p><p>"I have to go into the office from 3 to 7."</p><p>Hokuto took his phone from the space on the couch between them. "Well, how about we just–"</p><p>"Hold on."</p><p>When Taiga came back after slipping away, he ignored Hokuto's confused expression and grabbed his wrist from behind the couch.</p><p>He didn't bother to notice Hokuto’s shock when he opened his hand to see the spare key that had been shoved onto his palm either.</p><p>"Just come over at 4 then," Taiga said as he flopped back into his spot.</p><p>"You can start and I'll just help out with whatever's left when I get back. You can just keep it too so I don't have to open the door for you every time you come over. Does that work for-..."</p><p>"... What?"</p><p>When Taiga looked over, he saw Hokuto still staring down at the small metal key held in his hold, the silence beginning to make him feel self conscious as he glanced between Hokuto and the TV to start the next episode.</p><p>"Did I do something weird?... If you don't like it, then give it back."</p><p>Taiga dropped the remote in his lap to reach over for the key, but before he could take it, Hokuto wrapped his fingers around it and closed it in his fist, leaving Taiga closer to him than he would have liked without purpose.</p><p>He watched as Hokuto held it to his chest, speaking in a voice that was much too soft and much too close to his ear.</p><p>"No, it's fine."</p><p>"You just have no idea what something like this means, do you?"</p><p>Before the shudder in his back could travel any further up his spine, Taiga swiftly retreated to his side of the couch and pulled a previously discarded blanket around him.</p><p>"It's just convenient. My editor has a spare just in case. I don't see what's so funny about it."</p><p>Hokuto leaned back into his spot, holding back his smile as he rounded his finger over the top of the key.</p><p>"I'll treasure it."</p><p>"Just watch the show already."</p><p>Somehow, it became a pattern.</p><p>Hokuto would arrive, he or Taiga would cook their dinner as Taiga asked questions and wrote notes of undetermined use, before finishing the night with some TV.</p><p>It was a pattern, but it was different from just being buried in his books.</p><p>It was different.</p><p>And that's all that mattered.</p><p>The days passed like a breeze.</p><p>Every day was a different whirlwind of culinary knowledge and skill.</p><p>While words weren't really being written for his manuscript, it was a blessing that words were being written at all.</p><h6></h6><p>The early morning air was crisp in Hokuto's lungs as he came down from his flat, his keys sounding against another as he sorted through the loop to find the right one to open the doors to Salut.</p><p>It had already been weeks since, but he couldn't keep his eye from catching the small silver key that mismatched from the dull bronze of the others he had long grown used to.</p><p>He gazed at the key for just a moment too long to the point that when the sound of approaching steps echoed down the alley, his fingers scrambled to grab the right key, jamming it into the lock as if he wasn't spending more time undoing the deadbolt than he usually did on his average day.</p><p>"Morning."</p><p>The latch thunked open.</p><p>"Morning."</p><p>Without looking, Hokuto could hear the chattering of Shintaro's teeth from behind him.</p><p>Shintaro was just a part timer. When he came in with his application, he had zero experience in cooking, baking, waiting, or bussing with his main motivation for picking Salut was just because it was close to his university.</p><p>There were many other applicants that were better qualified and had more experience, but they couldn't deny that his gusto and his exertion that he could learn and learn quickly wasn't convincing. What really won him the job was he laughed at Jesse's jokes well all the others had cringed.</p><p>Anyone who laughed at Jesse's jokes was a good person and a perfect match and having a cohesive and cooperative team was better than one that fell apart, no matter how perfectly the person could make a confit.</p><p>"Isn't it too cold?? I thought it was supposed to be warm this time of year."</p><p>Hokuto pushed open the door, letting the thinly clothed Shintaro in first with the large duffle he had swung onto his back. "It's supposed to be warmer the next few weeks."</p><p>"It'd also be less cold if you wore long pants."</p><p>Shintaro turned on his heel to face him as Hokuto entered after him, the lights inside already turned on by Jesse who already arrived first. "Look, Hokuto, I have a strict lifestyle that I stand by. I'm not going to give in just because of a little chill."</p><p>"Then be cold then."</p><p>"Mean…"</p><p>Hokuto set back the lock that would stay until opening as Shintaro slipped off his duffle from his shoulder to hold in his hand.</p><p>"Speaking of lifestyles, it's been a while since I've seen a girl leave your place."</p><p>Hokuto let out a sigh as he pulled off his coat. "I don't see what the issue is here," he said, walking to the kitchen door as Shintaro followed in tow.</p><p>"I was starting to wonder if our Hokuto was losing his touch!" Shintaro huffed jokingly, dropping down his bag to pull out his work clothes as Jesse and Hokuto exchanged good mornings. "I even started to get worried that something was wrong with you!"</p><p>Hokuto threw his jacket on his hook before trading it for his apron to start helping Jesse with preparations. "No, nothing is wrong. I've just been busy."</p><p>"Busy with what?"</p><p>"Busy with 'it's none of your business'. Are you just going to stand there or are you going to help?"</p><p>Shintaro frowned, stepping away to change before returning to complain about how he can never get the layers in puff pastries correct.</p><p>Shintaro's observations weren't wrong.</p><p>Less women had been leaving his place than they had before.</p><p>But Hokuto wasn't wrong either.</p><p>He was busy.</p><p>He just didn't say busy with what.</p><p>"Oh, before my hands get dirty, I forgot to give you this from the other day. I found it in my pocket before I did laundry."</p><p>Hokuto looked up from his bowl to see the scrap paper Shintaro held out casually between his fingers.</p><p>"It's from a person we did a delivery to. He told me to give it to you. Do you want me to throw it out or-"</p><p>"No." Hokuto set down his bowl and spatula to quickly wipe down his hands on his apron, Shintaro blinking as Hokuto plucked it from his fingers. "I'll take this one."</p><p>".... Alright. Have fun, I guess." Shintaro’s tone was questioning before he dropped it to see Jesse what he needed help with.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Hokuto had been given a note after Shintaro returned from a delivery. Every so often, he would come back with a paper or short letter that contained a phone number with "call me" scribbled across the bottom or something of a similar nature. Usually Hokuto didn't bother to give them all that much thought, feigning the excuse of "I rather you ask me in person" when asked why he never replied or called back.</p><p>But this note, he could immediately tell who it was from.</p><p>The messily placed but neat handwriting on the back of the torn off corner of a page made it obvious enough.</p><p>The soft chatter between his workmates with the gentle bustle and clatter of their work sounded behind him as Hokuto pushed his thumb on the top, separating the layers to let him open the folded slip.</p><p>
  <em>Thanks</em>
</p><p>Hokuto bit at the inside of his cheek.</p><p>He had thought that maybe the extra macaron he added to the order had gone unnoticed since it was never mentioned the days after the delivery. He wouldn't have minded either way, but he didn't think that Shintaro had the reply in his pocket this whole time.</p><p>After another moment of studying the way the handwriting became smaller with its particles, the paper crinkled as Hokuto folded it again and quickly pushed it into his breast pocket, stifling the way his heart warmed and the smile on his lips. When he turned back around, he found one less person than he expected.</p><p>"He went to go get flour," Jesse smiled, answering Hokuto's wordless question. "Is the filling done?"</p><p>"Ah. Yeah."</p><p>Hokuto handed Jesse his bowl before helping him cut the dough to be filled and baked.</p><p>"... You know, you have been a little different lately," Jesse said, cutting into the smooth dough with his knife.</p><p>"You think so?"</p><p>The two of them kept their eyes on their work as they talked.</p><p>"Just a little," Jesse chuckled as he slid layers over to Hokuto to fill. "Your course ideas have been more creative recently. Have you been doing more research?"</p><p>"In a way."</p><p>Jesse peeked over to see Hokuto's focused image as he folded the dough over the filling and cut even slits over the top.</p><p>"... Has something been on your mind?"</p><p>Jesse had always been like this.</p><p>Whether or not anything was actually wrong, he never spared a second to at least ask to make sure. It was a part of what made him so endearing and Hokuto couldn't have asked for a better person to run the restaurant with him.</p><p>Hokuto never held back in confiding in him, taking the quiet early mornings they had with each other to talk about whatever came to mind. Jesse had brought his own fair share of problems to the kitchen which Hokuto was always willing to help with, regardless of how helpful his advice was or not. Jesse had an optimistic and bright outlook Hokuto didn't have that he always found value from listening to.</p><p>But this one he wanted to keep to himself.</p><p>"No. Not really."</p><p>"I guess I've just been wanting to try something different."</p><p>Jesse smiled as he went to fetch the egg wash while Hokuto aligned the unbaked chaussons aux pommes onto the sheets. "Well, if that's all it is, then I say keep it up. Business has been good lately and returning customers seem to be enjoying the fresh ideas."</p><p>Hokuto laughed a little.</p><p>"Of course. Anything for business."</p><p>"Shintaro and I were talking about getting drinks tonight, are you open?"</p><p>"Sorry, not today."</p><p>"You really are busy…"</p><p>There was an hour until opening and there was still plenty to do.</p><p>Hokuto went to ready the dining area as Jesse finished his preparations. Shintaro returned on his motorbike, parking it in the back and coming in with the sack of flour hauled over his shoulder before Hokuto waved for him to fix his hair before helping him open.</p><p>As Hokuto swapped his apron for his usual waist apron, he took a deep breath as he flipped the sign and unlocked the door.</p><p>It wasn't too long before the first customer stepped in.</p><p>Hokuto put on a warm smile and bowed his head.</p><p>"Welcome. Will it just be you dining with us today?"</p><h6></h6><p>"Good morning."</p><p>Taiga stared at the man who stood at his front door after pressing the doorbell just one too many times for Taiga's liking. His dark hair was still wet with his towel over his shoulders as Juri grinned, stepping past Taiga and his door to welcome himself in.</p><p>Out of all the things that threw off his previous life pattern, Hokuto was first, but Juri was an extremely close second.</p><p>He had taken over his previous editor's job, which in the end, Taiga didn't mind all that much. It wasn't that he didn't like her, he liked her a lot, but if she had caught him with Hokuto in his home, he probably would have fired himself instead of just waiting for the next however many months.</p><p>Also Juri was great at his job. Taiga knew that better than anyone.</p><p>Juri was great at listening and talking at the same time. He was patient and always seemed to ask the perfect questions to the point where it seemed like he almost knew Taiga better than he knew himself.</p><p>When they talked, Taiga was sent back to the days when Juri was still chatting ecstatically about how editors found and brought out the beauty in an author's story. It felt like no time had passed at all as they talked with ease about how things had been and what was on Taiga's mind. All as if Juri hadn’t moved to Osaka 5 years ago.</p><p>Juri was just the same as he was in college, just in more expensive clothing.</p><p>It was great to have an old friend back.</p><p>It was just that Juri loved to arrive unannounced.</p><p>Not only did he come over when Hokuto was there, but he came over when he was sleeping, when he was eating, and like today, when he was in the shower.</p><p>As annoying as it was, Taiga at least appreciated one thing about Juri.</p><p>He never insisted on him writing romance.</p><p>He didn't even question Taiga's process.</p><p>"As long as you believe there's something," he had told him.</p><p>That on its own almost made Taiga forgive him for everything else.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>"Morning shower today?" Juri asked as he tossed his briefcase onto Taiga's couch.</p><p>Taiga frowned, shutting his door behind him.</p><p>"I stayed up late and fell asleep without one," Taiga said as he watched Juri shed off his suit jacket. "Why? Are you going to scold me?"</p><p>Juri just laughed and loosened his tie.</p><p>"No, of course not. Go finish up. I'll make us some coffee."</p><p>Taiga ruffled his towel into his hair, forfeiting the pointless battle he would lose. "Alright. Thanks."</p><p>Juri pulled out a box of cigarettes from his breast pocket and shaked it at Taiga before he disappeared into his room.</p><p>"Mind if I smoke?"</p><p>Taiga just pointed at the kitchen vent.</p><p>"You know the drill."</p><p>Taiga left to dry his hair and dress himself and when he returned, Juri was already starting his second smoke as he leaned under the vent, flipping through the scattered notes Taiga had written over the week.</p><p>The click of his door behind him drew Juri's attention as he looked over, plucking the cigarette from his lips while he tucked away his lighter, smiling and waving Taiga over.</p><p>"Is this the same dish from college?"</p><p>Taiga took the coffee mug Juri held out to him before glancing at the clear emerald glass tray that now held the ashes of Juri's spent cigarettes.</p><p>He had forgotten that he had bought it when Juri was over in his tiny apartment.</p><p>Back then, Juri had to smoke out of the window.</p><p>"I guess so…"</p><p>Juri chuckled past the end of the filter before patting at Taiga's back and putting the notes he had been pouring over between them as the fan hummed steadily above.</p><p>"This is all interesting," Juri said, smoke leaving his lips as he pointed down at the papers. "I mean it's kind of like reading an amateur cook book, but the details are much more about the action than the technique. It's amazing to see how your brain works."</p><p>Taiga sipped his coffee, hardly reading the lines Juri pointed to.</p><p>"Thanks…"</p><p>"I think…"</p><p>Juri went on, flipping through the pages as the end of his cigarette glowed.</p><p>"More than that, these notes about Hokuto are fascinating."</p><p>The papers creased when Taiga slapped his hand over them, dragging and ripping them away from Juri's sight.</p><p>Not that it really mattered.</p><p>Juri had already read all of them.</p><p>It was less that he was embarrassed, but more that he felt like a weird freak for writing down observations about the man that came over to cook more than once a week.</p><p>Juri just smiled as he put on his cigarette, chasing the last breath of smoke with his coffee as he watched Taiga awkwardly straighten the pages together.</p><p>"You've been having fun with him?"</p><p>Taiga scowled as he folded the papers in half.</p><p>"It's work."</p><p>"It's not fun."</p><p>Juri hummed, turning off the fan as he gave Taiga a look up and down.</p><p>"... No sweats today?"</p><p>Taiga fixed his glasses before turning back to Juri and looking down at himself.</p><p>"Ah. Yeah."</p><p>Juri pushed his cigarette box back into his pocket.</p><p>"You're also up early. I was a little surprised that you answered the door."</p><p>Then why did he come over if he expected him to be asleep?</p><p>"Yeah…" Taiga said, keeping his retort to himself.</p><p>"... Would it bother you if I asked the reason why?"</p><p>Taiga opened his mouth to reply, but the reason himself entered his key into the door.</p><p>If it had been anyone else, Taiga would have jolted forward to keep them from answering, but he just watched, tiredly drinking his coffee as Juri unlatched and opened the door.</p><p>Juri was already grinning before he saw who was on the other side.</p><p>"I knew it had to be you."</p><p>Hokuto was nearly taken aback when the key was pulled from his hand as the door swung open.</p><p>Taiga could see Hokuto glance over at him past Juri to which he just gave a lazy wave.</p><p>He listened to their conversation as he finished his drink.</p><p>"You're also well dressed today," Juri chuckled as Hokuto fixed his bag across his chest.</p><p>"... Why would I be dressed badly?"</p><p>Juri changed the subject.</p><p>"So! Where are you two going this morning?"</p><p>Taiga replied from the kitchen. "We're going to the local market."</p><p>"Ohh, sounds fun!" Juri smiled before turning back to Hokuto who was reaching past him to retrieve his key from the lock.</p><p>"No work today?"</p><p>"No, we're off," Hokuto flatly responded before leaning around Juri to speak to Taiga.</p><p>"Are you ready?"</p><p>Taiga nodded, placing his cup in the sink before getting his shoulder bag. "Yeah, give me a half second."</p><p>Juri gave an exaggerated sigh, leaning against the door frame as Taiga returned with his wallet. "Ahh how nice! I wish I could have a fun morning at the market!"</p><p>"Do you want to come with us?" Taiga asked as he toed on his shoes, already knowing the answer, but figuring it was worth asking out of curiosity.</p><p>Juri crossed his arms, resting his head against the frame in disappointment. "No, I can't. I only spared the first few hours this morning to spend with my author before a series of meetings, but seeing that he's about to run away, my whole schedule is ruined."</p><p>"How selfish, right Hokuto?"</p><p>Hokuto shrugged, giving a complicit "sure" as Taiga grumbled to himself.</p><p>"Maybe if you had told me, I would have rescheduled…"</p><p>Juri chuckled, turning to grip at Taiga's shoulder as he raised his head from his shoes.</p><p>"Well, I'll let you two youngsters go have fun."</p><p>"I'm older than you."</p><p>Juri ignored Taiga as he sighed.</p><p>"But I'll need a favor as repayment."</p><p>Taiga already didn't like the sound of that.</p><p>If it had anyone else, Taiga wouldn't have been so cautious, but this was Juri.</p><p>Juri loved being unpredictable.</p><p>Taiga gripped his bag.</p><p>"... What is it?..."</p><p>"Tonight, I have a party-"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Before Taiga could slip out the door, Juri planted his hand onto the other side of the frame, blocking him from moving forward.</p><p>"Kyomo…" Juri spoke in a playful stern tone.</p><p>"If you don't come, I'm not letting you go."</p><p>"Juri."</p><p>Taiga tried to duck under his arm, but Juri moved his whole body in front of him, making Taiga collide into his chest.</p><p>This was embarrassing.</p><p>It was embarrassing enough on its own, but seeing Hokuto standing there watching made it unbearable as his face flushed red.</p><p>"Juri." Taiga asserted again.</p><p>"Move."</p><p>Juri shook his head.</p><p>"You know my terms, Kyomo."</p><p>"If you go, you go to the party too."</p><p>Taiga grit his teeth.</p><p>"I promise it'll be good for you to socialize. It's only a casual dinner with friends to catch up."</p><p>"<em>Your</em> friends."</p><p>"You know some of them from college."</p><p>"And you know I never talked to them."</p><p>"I'll give you a seat at the end."</p><p>"Can I bring Matsumura?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>From over Juri's shoulder, Taiga saw Hokuto blink in surprise from suddenly being pulled into the conversation.</p><p>"Yeah, Hokuto can come."</p><p>Juri looked behind him. "Do you want to go?"</p><p>"U-uh… sure?"</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure if he had ever seen Hokuto so scattered.</p><p>"Then it's a deal."</p><p>Taiga pushed Juri aside as if he was his front door.</p><p>"I'll send you the address, alright? 8 pm!"</p><p>Taiga just waved his hand as Hokuto followed him down the hall.</p><p>"Yeah, whatever."</p><p>"Lock the door for me, will you?"</p><p>Juri chuckled. "Anything for you."</p><p>The elevator pinged after Taiga jammed his finger into the button, waiting for it to open its doors and let them both in where they would be silent until Hokuto finally asked before they hit the bottom floor.</p><p>"Why do you want me to go with you?"</p><p>The elevator pinged again, the doors rumbling as they opened.</p><p>"... You'll see."</p><h6></h6><p>From the moment they walked up and out from the subway station, Taiga was already amazed as he let Juri's stupid terms flush from his mind.</p><p>Taiga had been aware that places like this existed. He had seen them before during a brief detour to avoid traffic and had heard about them from those much more experienced, but he never found himself going to one until now.</p><p>After all, there was no purpose in buying groceries when he had no plans to use them, but from the way Hokuto had described the local marketplace before, Taiga found himself immediately intrigued and eager to visit despite Hokuto's proposed early waking time.</p><p>It wasn't like a hidden wonderland, but Taiga still found himself fascinated by the narrow covered area that was framed by tall concrete buildings on either side, brimming full of stalls and store fronts offering produce cultivated with the owner's blood, sweat and tears.</p><p>"Shall we go?"</p><p>Taiga shut his mouth that had been hanging open and nodded.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Taiga followed closely behind as the crowd began to thicken, relying on Hokuto's experience to take them exactly where they needed to go.</p><p>"Do you come here every morning?"</p><p>Hokuto shook his head, smoothly cutting between people until they reached a stall with an array of vegetables.</p><p>"Not every morning, but as much as I can."</p><p>Taiga peeked over Hokuto’s shoulder, trying to understand how he could possibly determine how much better one shallot was from another.</p><p>"Then this is where you buy your stuff for Salut?"</p><p>"Sometimes, depending on the seller, but usually what I buy here is only for myself."</p><p>Taiga waited patiently while Hokuto handed the storekeep his selection with a smile, complimenting her hair and making her laugh as she took his pay after totaling his due.</p><p>When Hokuto turned to him, Taiga blinked before remembering to hold open a bag Hokuto had handed him for their purchases.</p><p>"We receive a delivery of the stock we typically require, but sometimes when I feel like trying something new, I'll come here to find some inspiration," Hokuto said as he waited for Taiga to sling the filled bag on his shoulder before moving further into the market.</p><p>"Is anything inspiring you right now?"</p><p>As Taiga stayed close, keeping himself from losing sight of Hokuto's back by the distracting stalls, he didn't notice the smile the other hid after a glance at him from over his shoulder.</p><p>Hokuto offered his hand, but Taiga just swatted it away from him.</p><p>"Not at the moment," Hokuto chuckled, gesturing to a stall providing poultry with a light sting still on his palm. "I try not to force it. It comes as it may."</p><p>Again, Taiga didn't find himself very satisfied with Hokuto's answer.</p><p>He didn't really have the luxury of waiting for inspiration to hit.</p><p>He really needed it to smash into his stagnated brain right now.</p><p>"Has anything here caught your eye?"</p><p>The crease disappeared from Taiga's brow when Hokuto brought his attention to the large tables holding more eggs than Taiga had ever seen in his whole life at once.</p><p>He watched as Hokuto took a container to begin filling it with his preferred selection.</p><p>"... Let me think about it…"</p><p>When watching the cooking series together, it was easy for Taiga to pick something from the multitude of dishes that came on the screen, but when drowned in endless opportunities, the fuse in Taiga's mind fizzled as he tried to think of anything at all.</p><p>Hokuto just chuckled to himself before a woman called his name with a big grin.</p><p>"Matsumura!"</p><p>When Hokuto straightened out, Taiga could see just how much taller he was than the young woman before him.</p><p>"Ah, hello Ayumi. Are you working by yourself today?"</p><p>Even from behind Hokuto's back, Taiga could see the rosy color that grew on the woman's cheeks.</p><p>"No, my mother just stepped away for a moment. It's a surprise to see you here! Didn't we just do a delivery to Salut just a few days ago?"</p><p>Hokuto bowed his head as she took the filled egg carton from his hands.</p><p>"Yes, your father dropped them off. Everything was just perfect as always, thank you. Today, I'm just here for myself."</p><p>Well, that wasn't really true, but it wasn't like Taiga was going to cut into the conversation to just say that it was for him as well.</p><p>"By the way, you look lovely."</p><p>Did she really?...</p><p>Taiga wasn't saying that to be mean or saying that the woman was unattractive, but she wore workers clothes with a colored bandana over her hair which Hokuto reached forward to tuck back into place behind her ear. He was by no means the rule maker of what looked nice or not, but he didn’t think that this was most considered to be “lovely”.</p><p>Yet, flattery was flattery and there was no surprise it worked well when it was used with a face like Hokuto's.</p><p>The woman giggled, the flush deepening as she traded the cash for his purchase after Hokuto had held her hand for a moment too long.</p><p>"Hold on, let me give you something."</p><p>After a swift disappearance, she returned to place another half carton over the first dozen.</p><p>"My cousin got some ducks and they just had some eggs. My mother was keeping it for us, but she won't mind if a couple were given to you."</p><p>Hokuto's face brightened as he took them both. "Are you sure?" he said with what Taiga found to be questionable genuinity.</p><p>"I couldn't possibly take something that's meant for your family-"</p><p>The woman just shook her head and pushed them further into Hokuto's arms.</p><p>"No! I insist! There is plenty from where those came from!"</p><p>Her eyes shyly slipped away from his.</p><p>"You can um… You can always come back if you ever want more-"</p><p>Barf.</p><p>Taiga resisted rolling his.</p><p>This is exactly why he didn't go to Salut, but somehow he still came face to face with Hokuto's blatant flirting.</p><p>Taiga directed his attention to the large tanks filled with fish across the way, waiting for Hokuto to finish before holding out the bag, not bothering to turn back his gaze as Hokuto carefully set the cartons inside.</p><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><p>"No, It's nothing."</p><p>"Did I make you jealous?"</p><p>"Don't even joke about that…"</p><p>"Alright. I'm sorry."</p><p>Even though Hokuto laughed, the way his voice was low and soft as he apologized made something in Taiga's heart pinch from its sincerity.</p><p>The past few weeks, Hokuto's forward nature had significantly lessened, but instead of it being a tease, they almost felt like blasé attempts to win his approval.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure which he preferred more.</p><p>The plastic around the cartons rustled as Hokuto pushed the loose ends into the bag.</p><p>"... Do you always get free stuff like this?"</p><p>Again, Hokuto waited for Taiga to position the bag comfortably on his shoulder before responding.</p><p>"Only when they're interested in me," he said as he shifted to glance at the butcher beside their original stop. "Is there something wrong with that?"</p><p>"... No… I guess not…" Taiga mumbled as he pushed his hands into his pockets. "But isn't it tiring?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Hokuto leaned over to see the selection of cuts from a better view.</p><p>"I mean…"</p><p>"Does it ever get tiring being treated differently just because you're attractive?"</p><p>It sounded ridiculous the moment he said it.</p><p>And from the way he swore he saw something tighten in Hokuto's back, he believed that Hokuto thought it was too.</p><p>It was like complaining about being rich.</p><p>Of course, Hokuto benefited from his looks, being treated better than others or given things for free as he had just now, but Taiga couldn't help but feel exhausted from watching.</p><p>Hokuto seemed to handle it well, but if it were him, he would have crumbled from the demand of attention.</p><p>Taiga blinked when Hokuto turned to push him backward by the shoulder, moving him out of the cluster of waiting customers and into the stream of people passing by.</p><p>"Matsumura-?"</p><p>"You really are sharp, aren't you?"</p><p>"Huh?" Taiga questioned as a loud rattling of a cart sounded from down the path with a man shouting for people to move out of the way.</p><p>Before the cart charged by, Hokuto grabbed Taiga by the arm, pulling him to his chest before the metal frame could snip at Taiga's ankles.</p><p>As soon as it was gone, Taiga shoved himself away.</p><p>While Taiga wiped down his sleeve of the invisible dust left by Hokuto's hand, he heard the other speak.</p><p>"Don't you get the same treatment?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Why was Hokuto looking back at him as if he was just as confused?</p><p>No, Taiga never considered himself attractive, nor did he ever get any special treatment.</p><p>He thought that was obvious. It was no surprise since he never really bothered to keep his looks anything more than clean.</p><p>But when Hokuto asked if he was treated the same did that mean that he–</p><p>"I'm not–"</p><p>"Did you find anything interesting yet?"</p><p>Taiga wasn't given another second to ask exactly what Hokuto had implied before his mind was switched to another topic. For a second, it drew a blank until his eyes caught sight of the blue color of the tanks from before.</p><p>"... What about crab?"</p><p>"No, I can't do crab."</p><p>Taiga's brow raised.</p><p>This was the first time Hokuto had ever said no.</p><p>But Hokuto still followed him as he headed towards the displays of fish.</p><p>"Shrimp?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Razor clams?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"I'm allergic."</p><p>"... How can you be a chef when you hate tomatoes and can't eat shrimp or clams?"</p><p>"Well, technically I'm still the waiter."</p><p>"Don't bring technicalities into this…"</p><p>Taiga could almost see the contemplative look in Hokuto's eyes from their hazy reflection in the glass tanks with sealife stirring within them.</p><p>"Of course, I make sacrifices for my job."</p><p>"I love what I do. It's what I've always wanted to do."</p><p>Hokuto loved to cook and to serve.</p><p>Did that include all the flirting?...</p><p>Taiga didn't know.</p><p>He didn't ask.</p><p>He changed the subject.</p><p>"... I want to have shellfish…"</p><p>Taiga couldn't tell if the smile Hokuto had was genuine or not.</p><p>Well, it didn't matter.</p><p>It was none of his business.</p><p>Just because Hokuto was attractive, didn't mean that <em>he</em> had to treat him any differently.</p><p>"If it's scallops, I can make something work."</p><p>"But can I ask why shellfish?"</p><p>Taiga watched the crabs that scuttled aimlessly in the tank.</p><p>"I don't know…"</p><p>"Juri likes shellfish, I guess."</p><h6></h6><p>The coquilles saint jacques was delicious as expected.</p><p>Expensive, but delicious as the creamy flavor of the sauce and gruyere baked on top balanced well with the subtle but deep taste of the shellfish.</p><p>Though Taiga wished he could have enjoyed it more as his mind was stirring with anxiety as he mindlessly swallowed half of it without hardly tasting it.</p><p>He didn't want to go to this party.</p><p>He really <em>really</em> didn't want to go to this party.</p><p>What was worse than a party with strangers was a party with people he sort of knew but at the same time didn't at all as it only meant that he would receive question after question of mindless pointless talk.</p><p>"Was there something you wanted me to do at his party?" Hokuto asked as he took Taiga's empty plate.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Just you being there is enough."</p><p>"... Are you trying to make my heart skip?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Taiga sighed as he got up, deciding to at least check his hair before leaving.</p><p>"You'll see, I promise."</p><p>The dread only sank deeper and deeper as they rode the train to the yakiniku restaurant and when Taiga saw Juri laughing with a small group of women, he wanted to run the other way.</p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, Hokuto put his hand on his back to push him forward.</p><p>"Juri!"</p><p>Juri turned when Hokuto called his name and grinned as they met him outside the entrance.</p><p>"Hokuto! You actually came! And Kyomo!"</p><p>Taiga could have crumbled to the ground from the force Juri pat his shoulder.</p><p>"You're here!! Ah- sorry, let me introduce you!"</p><p>Juri stepped aside to present them to the three people he had been talking to.</p><p>"These three gorgeous women are from Osaka! We got so distracted by how much fun we were having that we hadn't made it inside yet, right?"</p><p>He turned to them for confirmation, all of them smiling and chuckling.</p><p>"At the end, we have the beauty of the publishing department, Haruka."</p><p>"Here is Marie, one of the smartest people I know."</p><p>"And last but not least, is Rise. She's very pretty, but don't try anything, she's currently has some else she has her eyes set on."</p><p>The woman wacked at Juri's arm playfully as Juri laughed, letting the three of them introduce themselves fully with a bow and their business cards.</p><p>Juri spoke with pride as Hokuto shook their hands. "The handsome tall one here is my old high school friend Matsumura Hokuto."</p><p>"You're not your eyes, he really is that handsome."</p><p>"And this!"</p><p>Taiga nearly fumbled his cards when Juri threw his arm over his shoulders.</p><p>"This is Kyomoto Taiga, the one who owns me."</p><p>Taiga didn't even flinch as the strangers laughed and chuckled at the implications of ownership.</p><p>This was something Juri used to do all the time, saying that "he belongs to Kyomoto Taiga" or "I won't hand Kyomo to you". It had been a while since, but even after so long, it didn't manage to bother him.</p><p>People in his company always talked about the close bond of editors and their writers anyhow.</p><p>"Nice to meet you…"</p><p>Juri flashed him a grin as he shook his shoulders. "With that all done, Come on, there's more people waiting inside."</p><p>Taiga wanted to resist being ushered inside, but there was no running now. Especially with Juri having his grip around him.</p><p>At least Juri gave him the seat at the end of the row of tables as promised, though Juri made him sit one spot in with Hokuto in the last seat.</p><p>There was a thorough mix of people Taiga recognized and didn't, though most he knew only by just their name or just their face. The man who sat next to him was someone who he remembered as another person in Juri's major. When he told Taiga his name, it didn't ring a bell, though the man's face was distinct in his mind. It was only until Juri called him "Shoppi" that Taiga remembered.</p><p>They talked for a bit, catching up on what little they actually had to catch up on, discussing their current conditions and how the last years have been treating them. Taiga replied as normally as he could muster, purposefully skirting around the fact that he could be losing his job in 4 months as he listened about Watanabe Shota's rather simple career as an editor. Thankfully, when the food and drink started coming, Taiga's conversation partner became more invested in his drink than maintaining their mundane talk, letting Taiga eat quietly by himself as his plan was working extraordinarily well.</p><p>The two people sitting across from him didn't bother to give him a second of their time as they were completely enamored with the man named Matsumura Hokuto.</p><p>This was exactly what Taiga wanted.</p><p>Hokuto's overwhelming charisma pulled so much attention that Taiga might as well be invisible and redirecting any conversation that was brought to him back to Hokuto worked like a charm.</p><p>Taiga was pleased.</p><p>He was so pleased he didn't notice that all the meat that appeared on his plate was given to him by Hokuto.</p><p>"Hey!! How is it going over here?" Juri smiled as he kneeled down between the two at the other side of the table who Taiga learned were both previous employees of his and Juri's current company.</p><p>"Wonderful!" One of them said, holding out his glass for Juri to fill. "I'm learning so much about your friend here!"</p><p>"I'm so impressed he's been able to do so much so young!"</p><p>Hokuto smiled politely as he set down his beer. "No no, it's not much at all. Just a bit of luck here and there."</p><p>Juri firmly nodded, placing the pitcher beside him as he sat down. "Absolutely. Hokuto is absolutely a wonder in every way, right?"</p><p>"Have you gotten to talk to Kyomo at all?"</p><p>Damnit, Juri.</p><p>He should have known that Juri was going to be the Achilles heel…</p><p>Taiga forced a smile as he shoved rice into his mouth to hopefully give off the message he didn't want to talk, but Juri talked for him.</p><p>"This person is the one who wrote Sapphire Bloom."</p><p>The woman's face brightened as she gasped. "Ah! So you're Kyomoto Taiga! Then Juri was your first editor?"</p><p>"Yep," Juri replied for him as Taiga chewed.</p><p>"I was still interning at our current company at the time but when I showed them Kyomo's first story, it basically promised me a position and a contract for Kyomo."</p><p>"Oh. I had no idea."</p><p>Taiga was almost more surprised that Hokuto didn't know than that he added to the conversation, but then he remembered that most of their conversations were only about food about what Hokuto thought about it. They really didn’t talk about himself much, which Taiga preferred.</p><p>"Pretty lucky, right?" Juri smiled, getting to his feet to move to the other side of the table. "Not too long after Sapphire Bloom was published as a novel, I was transferred to Osaka even though I was originally assigned to help with his second manuscript."</p><p>"Imagine my surprise when the book that came out was completely different from what we discussed."</p><p>When Juri shook his shoulders, the two laughed while Taiga missed his mouth as he went to take a bite of his pork belly.</p><p>Hokuto placed more meat onto the grill as Juri took a napkin to apologetically clean the corner of Taiga's lips.</p><p>"Was he supposed to–"</p><p>"So you two met in highschool?"</p><p>Before Hokuto could finish his question, Taiga spoke over him.</p><p>He just didn't want to talk about his writing.</p><p>It haunted him enough during his waking hours. He really didn't need it at this party either.</p><p>As he always did, Juri caught on quickly and shifted the topic after giving his shoulder a squeeze.</p><p>"Hokuto and I? Yes, that's right. I'm sure you guys have already talked all about what he's doing now, so what dirt from highschool can I dig up?"</p><p>"Juri."</p><p>Hokuto's voice was sharp when he said his name, but kept a playful tone that matched the atmosphere of the party.</p><p>Either way, Juri just laughed and pat his hand on his back.</p><p>"Don't worry, I won't say anything you don't want to be said. It's not like there's all that much to say anyways."</p><p>Taiga tried to not appear eager as he picked at the grains at the bottom of his bowl.</p><p>He was already happy to not have his past be the topic of discussion, but he couldn't help but be a little more than curious about what made Hokuto like <em>this</em>. Whatever <em>this</em> was.</p><p>Juri hummed, leaning himself over into the space between Taiga and Hokuto to rest his elbow on the table while looking up at his dark haired friend.</p><p>"Hokuto was rather quiet back then. Kept to himself, had high grades, always enjoyed cooking and making food for as long as I can remember."</p><p>"You cooked in high school too?" The man across from them asked.</p><p>Hokuto smiled. "Sometimes."</p><p>"All the time!" Juri corrected him as he sat back straight. "He used to come to school with his lunch and lie that his mom made it for him instead of admitting he did it himself!"</p><p>"I told him that girls would love it, but he didn't really care. Not that he needs the help or anything."</p><p>"After that we-"</p><p>"Tanaka!! Glasses are dry on this side!!"</p><p>Juri peered over the line of heads to the person who had raised up their empty glass, waiting for it to be filled.</p><p>"Alright! I'm coming!" Juri called back before bumping Hokuto's shoulder. "I'll leave the rest to you then."</p><p>As Juri stood up, he made sure to lean forward and speak to Taiga in a low voice.</p><p>"I'll check on you later, alright? Just relax."</p><p>"Don't rely on Hokuto too much."</p><p>When Taiga only replied with grabbing his beer, Juri smiled and bumped the back of his fingers against Taiga's neck before slipping away with the pitcher.</p><p>After checking his phone, Taiga couldn't believe it had only been an hour.</p><p>It had already felt like an eternity.</p><p>Taiga distracted himself with his food and drink as he passively listened to the conversations around him.</p><p>The speech of the man next to him slowly became more and more slurred as the drinks continued to flow, complaining and whining about how his youth was coming to his colleague across from him.</p><p>Taiga didn't catch the other person's name.</p><p>He may have heard Juri call him "master" but the most Taiga knew about him was that he had the patience of a saint as he nodded and agreed without question, though it was most likely because he was hardly listening as he ate.</p><p>After a few large exaggerated movements from the man Juri called Shoppi, Hokuto used the grill as an excuse to move closer to Taiga as he lowered his head to ask if he wanted to switch seats.</p><p>Taiga immediately said yes as he picked up his plate, lying to the people who gave him enquiring looks that it was just the overhead light that was straining his eyes.</p><p>It was only a one seat difference, but it was like he was thrown a life ring after drowning in open water.</p><p>It made the few questions he got a little more bearable as he was able to breath with the open end on one side and what felt like a wall holding back his worst worries on the other.</p><p>Really.</p><p>Bringing Hokuto was probably the smartest thing he had ever done in his life.</p><p>Not even his own books could beat this.</p><h6></h6><p>"Kyomo?"</p><p>Taiga's heavy lids blinked open as Juri tapped his arm after kneeling down beside him.</p><p>"Hmm?" Taiga huffed, only just noticing the glass in his hand was empty after he tried to take a drink from it.</p><p>Juri let out a soft chuckle as Taiga set it down and pushed it away from himself. "People are starting to talk about moving to a different bar."</p><p>"I'm assuming you don't want to go."</p><p>"Absolutely not."</p><p>"I thought so," Juri smiled.</p><p>"So I'll let you go."</p><p>Taiga suddenly felt a lot more awake.</p><p>"Really?!"</p><p>The people around him were thankfully a little too drunk to notice his enthusiasm.</p><p>"I figured you might as well before you fell asleep on your seat."</p><p>Taiga didn't think he could have gotten to his feet any faster.</p><p>Juri followed him as the party continued to spiritedly chatter around them. "I'll just tell people you drank too much and had to have Hokuto take you home, is that okay?"</p><p>He looked to Hokuto who was already standing up with them.</p><p>"Yeah, that's fine."</p><p>Juri grinned at his two friends.</p><p>"Great. Let me see you guys out."</p><p>Taiga went with Juri to the door as Hokuto was stopped by the woman he had been talking to before.</p><p>Just from the view from the window, Taiga was more than ready to get that first breath of fresh air when he stepped out as they waited for Hokuto to finish exchanging numbers and say goodbye.</p><p>"You two play nice, okay?"</p><p>Taiga turned to Juri behind him, frowning when he saw the teasing grin.</p><p>He looked out the window again.</p><p>"It's not like that."</p><p>"Yes, I know."</p><p>"But, Kyomo…"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>When Juri took his shoulders to make him face him, Taiga blinked.</p><p>There was something about Juri.</p><p>There had always been something about Juri that made his chest feel warm.</p><p>It was just the same as it had been in college.</p><p>If Juri was there, Taiga felt like he could do anything.</p><p>Taiga had completely forgotten what it felt like.</p><p>"If he does anything bad to you, just call me."</p><p>Taiga's jaw tensed as he nodded.</p><p>"He won't."</p><p>"What are you guys talking about?"</p><p>As Hokuto came over, Juri gave him a friendly smile, making it appear that they were doing nothing more than having casual conversation.</p><p>"Oh nothing. I was just asking Kyomo if he had ever considered dying his hair."</p><p>Taiga ran with it, hiding the previous topic from the subject himself as he sighed, letting Juri slip his fingers under his fringe to feel the smooth strands between his thumb.</p><p>"Are you saying it looks bad?"</p><p>Though it was just a diverting comment, Taiga couldn't help but be a little insulted even when he didn't really care in the end. If his hair was bad, then it was bad. The upkeep required for colored hair was way more work than he was willing to offer.</p><p>Hokuto thought he looked decent, apparently. So it couldn't be that bad.</p><p>"No, it looks fine. I just wonder if it would lighten you up a little," Juri smiled, taking his hand back after brushing Taiga's hair back into place.</p><p>"Mentally or physically?"</p><p>Juri laughed as he opened the door for the both of them.</p><p>"Preferably both, but don't let me keep you guys any longer. Text me when you get home, alright?"</p><p>They traded goodbyes as Hokuto followed Taiga outside. Once the door closed behind them, Taiga finally filled his lungs with the crisp air, his whole body chilling aside from the warm buzz in his center.</p><p>"... Kyomoto?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Train or car?"</p><p>He zipped his hoodie up to his neck.</p><p>"Doesn't matter to me."</p><p>They walked and found the station faster than they did a free cab.</p><p>It was a blessing the train was mostly empty at this time of night as the swaying of the cart almost made Taiga stumble before he could grab a pole to keep his feet grounded.</p><p>He was drunker than he thought as he pulled himself to a seat, exhaling through his nose as Hokuto took the seat beside him. As Hokuto took out his phone from his bag, Taiga kept his eyes on the windows across from him, seeing the train on the opposite rail whip by as his seat jostled gently under him.</p><p>Soon, their train sang its tune and the doors slid closed, sighing as they met before the wheels came to life and once they left the station with the night created his reflection in the glass.</p><p>Taiga stared at himself, seeing Hokuto beside him with his head lowered facing his phone.</p><p>When he reached up to fix his hair, Hokuto peered at him through the evening-made mirror for a second before returning to his screen.</p><p>"Are you still thinking about what Juri said?"</p><p>Taiga dropped his hand back into his lap, catching the message that glowed on Hokuto's phone the moment after he locked it from the edge of his vision.</p><p>"... Not really…"</p><p>Hokuto sat back as Taiga met the reflected image of his eyes with his own.</p><p>With the layer of separation, it made it less intimidating.</p><p>"Do you want to change your hair?"</p><p>"No…"</p><p>"Then it's fine as it is."</p><p>"Is that because you think I'm attractive?"</p><p>"Do you actually want me to answer that?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Hokuto let out a low chuckle as Taiga saw his phone brighten again.</p><p>Both times and every time, it was a girl's name.</p><p>A different one.</p><p>Taiga had noticed before when Hokuto's phone was set between them as they watched TV or when the message dropped down from the top as Taiga read a recipe from the phone when Hokuto's hands were dirty. Each time it was always different with different emojis and hearts attached to the message.</p><p>This was pretty typical though there was one name that seemed to show up just a bit more than the others.</p><p>Taiga looked the other way as Hokuto unlocked his phone.</p><p>Juri had said Hokuto was quiet before…</p><p>That wasn't exactly what Taiga had imagined.</p><p>Wasn't this the person who flirted with all his customers? The same person who confidently teased him at the theme park before insistently asked him on a date?</p><p>He didn't think that the person getting all these texts from women would have been timid in his youth. He had expected a high school playboy who stole and broke many hearts.</p><p>Not a boy who was afraid to say he made his lunch himself.</p><p>How was that the same person who he had seen lipstick smudged over his lips?</p><p>It didn't make sense.</p><p>Nothing about Hokuto ever made sense.</p><p>The automated voice announced Taiga's stop and when Hokuto got up with him, Taiga gave him a confused look.</p><p>"I'll see you to your door."</p><p>"You don't need to do that."</p><p>"I saw you nearly fall over earlier. Let me at least bring you to your building."</p><p>The embarrassment from Hokuto being witness to his pathetic moment of weakness made Taiga hold back his objections even as Hokuto went inside his apartment building with him.</p><p>Taiga tapped the elevator button many more times than needed as if it would make it arrive any faster as he heard Hokuto speak from behind him.</p><p>"Can I ask something?"</p><p>Taiga sighed, forfeiting to the button as he shoved his hand back into his pocket.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>The elevator light came on, announcing its arrival.</p><p>"Did the way Juri talk to those girls not bother you?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>The doors slid open.</p><p>"Oh, you mean before we went in?"</p><p>Hokuto pressed Taiga's floor button for him as Taiga leaned against the wall.</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"No…" Taiga spoke, emphasizing in his voice that it was strange to assume otherwise. "Why would that have bothered me?"</p><p>"You hated it when I talked to the woman at the market this morning though, didn't you?"</p><p>"You noticed?</p><p>"Sometimes you're not the most secretive with your expressions."</p><p>"..."</p><p>The elevator chimed and the doors slid open as Taiga opened his bag to look for his key.</p><p>"Aren't they the same thing?"</p><p>"No," Taiga said, his keys jingling in his hand as he pulled them out.</p><p>"It's not."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"It's different."</p><p>"It seemed similar to me."</p><p>Taiga pushed his keys into the lock.</p><p>"It's just his business talk. You do all that other-... stuff or whatever that makes it all gross."</p><p>"I don't think warming up a client is all that different from flirting."</p><p>"Juri does it with men too. It's not like that."</p><p>Taiga's keyring clattered against the door as it came open.</p><p>"Then would it make a difference if I flirted with men too?"</p><p>The creak of the door stopped as Taiga's hand stopped.</p><p>And when Taiga slowly looked over to Hokuto beside him, Hokuto wore an expression he couldn't understand.</p><p>"... Huh?... Why would that–"</p><p>"Oh, I forgot."</p><p>Taiga blinked as he watched Hokuto open his bag before his alcohol riddled mind completely forgot what they were just talking about when books were pulled out from inside.</p><p>"I should have given these to you earlier. You wanted to see them?"</p><p>Hokuto barely had time to put his bag back on his shoulder before Taiga yanked from his hands the books that had grown round and softened at the corners from wear.</p><p>"Yes!! Thank you!!"</p><p>As Taiga flipped through the worn down pages, he had also forgotten that he had asked Hokuto for the cook books that drove his love for cooking. He hoped that whatever had lit the fires of inspiration in Hokuto could give him at least the tiniest of sparks.</p><p>"Keep them as long as you want. I'm sure if I need them, I can come back for them."</p><p>That made a hit of guilt twisted in Taiga's chest.</p><p>It wasn't that Taiga felt like he had done anything wrong, but Hokuto had been hauling the books all day just because he had asked a favor of him.</p><p>"Um…"</p><p>When Hokuto looked up after pulling out his keys, with one attached that looked very familiar, Taiga spoke up.</p><p>"Do you want to come inside?"</p><p>It was reasonable for Hokuto to look so confused. After all, he had just said that he didn't need to follow him to his door, but it was only right to show Hokuto some courtesy.</p><p>"If you're in no rush to go home, we can watch another episode of the show and I can make some tea or something…"</p><p>Taiga was already embarrassed, but seeing how Hokuto's eyes softened and his small nod saying yes only made his ears almost burn.</p><p>Thank god the room was dark.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>He pushed the door open to let Hokuto follow in after as he went to fill the kettle, setting it away from the dishes that were left undone.</p><p>It almost felt strange to not have Hokuto immediately follow him into the kitchen.</p><p>"... How much longer do you have?" Taiga heard Hokuto ask from the living area.</p><p>As vague as the question was, Taiga knew what Hokuto was referring to. It wasn't like there were many other countdowns in his life.</p><p>"... 4 months and 18 days…"</p><p>Time was running out, but at least he wasn't empty handed.</p><p>He had something. He just didn't know what to do with it.</p><p>"Do you want me to cross off today for you?"</p><p>The kettle rang quietly against the stove before Taiga turned on the flame.</p><p>"Go ahead. Be my guest."</p><p>Hokuto popped the cap off the pen to draw another 'X' on the calendar that was somehow distinctly different from the others before he followed what became their usual pattern of clearing the coffee table for whatever they were treating themselves after their dinner as they watched TV.</p><p>Despite its differences tonight, Taiga had become used to this as his nighttime ritual. With the creeping deadline, some of his previous editors may have called all of this a waste of time, but it put his life in a dependable rhythm that wasn't dominated by helplessly suffering in front of the blank page on his computer.</p><p>Any progress was progress, even if it wasn't really progress at all.</p><p>Hokuto turned on a baking competition, replacing the last show that had become stale after seasons of the same storyline and drama with just different fillings.</p><p>It was comfortable.</p><p>"Ready?"</p><p>Taiga nodded, setting down the teapot to lean back into his spot on the couch with his cup in hand, the room going dark as the episode loaded before it was filled with the bright saturated colors from the screen.</p><p>They did as they usually did, as they always did, as they watched in quiet only until Taiga had something to ask to which Hokuto always replied.</p><p>The third episode was about tiered cakes as beautifully and skillfully crafted towers made by the day's judge were shown on screen.</p><p>"... How do they get the frosting to lay so smooth?"</p><p>"You don't want to wait to find out?"</p><p>"I like how you explain it."</p><p>The dark veiled Hokuto's smile as he held out his hands in front of him, the light from the TV dimly illuminating them.</p><p>"You can see they use those cake stands that turn."</p><p>Taiga nodded, glancing between Hokuto's vague but understandable representation of the cake's surface with his hand with the other holding the imaginary leveler and the TV screen.</p><p>"They layer on the butter cream and then use the leveling tool to make sure it's flat and has an even shape."</p><p>"I see, like this?" Taiga said, setting down his cup to mimic Hokuto's posture.</p><p>"No, it lays more flat."</p><p>Taiga focused on his posture as Hokuto leaned over the empty space on the couch to reach over and adjust the angle of Taiga's wrist, his fingers setting gently on the back of Taiga's hand and turning it slowly with his own.</p><p>"This way it guides the cream instead of tugging at it which can make the tool skip."</p><p>It was silent as both of them watched Taiga's fingers rotate with Hokuto's to spread a cream that wasn't there with only the haughty banter of the competitors on screen.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure what got him to look.</p><p>It must have been Hokuto's gaze that he caught in the corner of his sight that pulled his eyes over to lock with Hokuto's.</p><p>Taiga was comfortable.</p><p>But maybe he had gotten too comfortable.</p><p>All Taiga could only think of was questions as his heart began to race.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why wasn't he looking at their hands?</p><p>Why was he looking at me?...</p><p>Taiga's breath caught in his throat as Hokuto's hand started to smooth over his, his warm palm laying over the back of it as his fingers traced along his own.</p><p>And just before Hokuto thread the tips of his fingers between his, Taiga yanked his hand back.</p><p>He looked back at the TV, hoping whatever happened would all go away if he pretended it didn't happen.</p><p>But Hokuto stayed, the space between them gone as his eyes didn't move from his.</p><p>"... Kyomoto."</p><p>Taiga kept his eyes on the TV as his hand gripped onto his sleeve, the warm feeling of Hokuto's touch still stinging his skin.</p><p>He struggled to get his voice out from his chest.</p><p>"... What?"</p><p>While his eyes were on the screen, his brain absorbed none of it.</p><p>In the dark room, Hokuto could see the images on the screen reflect off Taiga's lenses, hiding the way Taiga's gaze wandered, hesitantly flickering over to him before jumping back to the TV.</p><p>Even though it was soft, Hokuto's voice sounded so much louder than the shouting people in the show that neither of them were really watching.</p><p>"... Do you hate it when I touch you?"</p><p>Taiga's body felt hot as his eyes shot over to Hokuto's again, stumbling over his words that came spilling out.</p><p>Taiga knew the answer.</p><p>So then why was it such a jumbled mess when he spoke?</p><p>"No! W-Well, yes, but no! I just-"</p><p>Though it brought no real defense, Taiga curled into the side of the couch as he brought his knees to his chest, tearing his eyes away from Hokuto's to watch, but not really watch the TV.</p><p>"I just don't like being touched. By anyone."</p><p>"But then what about Juri? He lays his hands all over you and you don't even flinch."</p><p>"Juri is different. He doesn't touch me like how you do it. When you do it, it just feels like you're trying to flirt with me and-"</p><p>"You keep saying that."</p><p>Taiga forced a nervous laugh. "What?? I-"</p><p>"You keep saying Juri is different. That with him, it's not the same. That he isn't like me."</p><p>"Do you not see how he touches you?"</p><p>Hokuto saw how Taiga's eyes widened.</p><p>Hokuto didn't know why his body felt hot or why his pulse was rising. Or why his body tensed, his chest clenched and his voice raised.</p><p>But what came from his mouth he couldn't stop.</p><p>"Do you not notice his hand on your back? Or his napkin on your mouth?"</p><p>"Do you not feel his fingers in your hair?"</p><p>"Is this all so different from me?"</p><p>Taiga's eyes started to shoot everywhere around the room besides the person beside him, his head was spinning as Hokuto's chest began to burn.</p><p>"I- I don't–"</p><p>"What if I did that to you?"</p><p>"What if I touched your hair?"</p><p>"What if I cleaned your lips?"</p><p>"Wouldn't you pull away as always?"</p><p>"How is all of that not flirting? Or am I just that disgusting to you?"</p><p>"No-! I-"</p><p>"Kyomoto."</p><p>Hokuto caught Taiga's eyes again when he called his name, not realizing that he had grown close enough to place his hand on the armrest at Taiga's side, trapping the other on the couch.</p><p>He could see how the light from the TV danced over Taiga's skin with shifting colors as he looked up at him in some sort of horror, his lips parted as his chest heaved with his arms crossed over it to protect himself from the man looming over him.</p><p>Like a river breaking free from a failing dam, the words came from Hokuto's lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you in love with Juri?"</p><p> </p><p>The only sound in the room was Taiga's breaths as they left his lips. Not even the TV played the music of the next episode as it paused, asking its viewers if they were still watching, which they weren't.</p><p>Hokuto expected a big reaction.</p><p>He expected an overexerted denial and complaint about how Hokuto continued to ask him if he was interested in men.</p><p>He thought that he would even be struck before being kicked out and told to never come back again.</p><p>He almost would have preferred that as he watched a deep red grow Taiga's skin that was dark enough to still be visible in the dark room.</p><p>He watched as Taiga's mouth widened as he covered it with his hand that trembled, his eyes breaking away from Hokuto's with a look that Hokuto could only recognize as realization.</p><p> </p><p>"... Juri?..."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s phone vibrated with a message.</p><p>It asked if he had gotten home safely.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm… in love with… Juri?"</p><h6></h6><p>His lights were on.</p><p>Hokuto knew what that meant when he unlocked the door to his flat.</p><p>"You're home so late."</p><p>He gave a smile as he set down his things.</p><p>"Sorry. I was out with a friend."</p><p>She stood up, sauntering over to him to place her hand on his chest to feel the muscles that hid underneath before slowly slipping the buttons on his shirt out from their loops.</p><p>"I've been so lonely while you've been gone. You'll keep me company tonight, won't you?"</p><p>Hokuto let her push his shirt off his shoulders as she whispered into his neck.</p><p>"What about your husband back home?"</p><p>"He's not the same as you."</p><p>His shirt dropped to the floor.</p><p>"Are you saying that you don't want me?"</p><p>Hokuto placed his hand on her thin waist to speak into her ear.</p><p>"No, of course not… Just let me use the shower first."</p><p>"Give me a taste before you go."</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his hair, leading him down to her lips for a kiss.</p><p>Hokuto waited for her to get her fill until he was released to the shower.</p><p>Before he entered the water, he paused to run the back of his hand against his lips to see how the red stain smeared up and along his wrist, knowing it would take more than soap to remove.</p><p>He let the hot water pour over his body as he scrubbed himself clean before he came out with only shorts and a towel over his head to see her on his bed playing with something between her fingers.</p><p>He froze.</p><p>From behind her ruby nails, Hokuto could see the neat, but misplaced handwriting.</p><p>"Hokkun~ What's this?" She said in her sweet voice with a smile as she held up the slip.</p><p>His lips stuck for a second before forming a smile and forcing words to come from them.</p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p>"Just some garbage."</p><p>She tilted her head before unfolding the paper and reading it out loud.</p><p>"It says 'Thanks'… Why was it on the stand next to your bed?"</p><p>Hokuto laughed and ruffled his hair with his towel. "I must have just forgotten it when doing laundry. Just took it out before throwing my clothes in."</p><p>"Then can I throw it away?"</p><p>Hokuto's hands stilled, his towel hiding his face.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>She smiled as she stood up, her heels clacking against his wood floor as she approached the trash.</p><p>He heard the tearing of paper.</p><p>Once.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>Then the fluttering of scraps falling into the empty bin.</p><p>Hokuto wondered if there would have been a third if the slip hadn't already been so small.</p><p>The towel slipped and fell to the floor as she pulled it from his head to cup his cheeks.</p><p>Her red lips formed a grin as she chuckled softly.</p><p>"Now what's this face?... You didn't actually care about that little piece of trash, did you?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No…"</p><p>He pulled her in by her hips, receiving an excited giggle as he kissed her neck, running his tongue over the soft skin as he pulled down the zipper on the back of her dress.</p><p>They stumbled to the bed, her dress dropping to the floor as he fell over her and her arms wrapped around his neck.</p><p>She sighed out a moan as Hokuto reached behind her to unclip her bra, his lips staying on her shoulder and collar, hiding his face he couldn't control.</p><p>"I love you, Hokuto."</p><p>"... I love you too."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Kyomoto Taiga was in love with Tanaka Juri.</p><p>… Maybe…</p><p>It made sense but it also didn't at the same time.</p><p>Tanaka Juri was the one who got him to write his first romance novel and was the one who almost got him to write his second. After Hokuto asked him if he was in love with Juri, all the memories that had disappeared from his mind came back in full force.</p><p>Taiga had forgotten that after an annoyingly persistent exertion from Juri to write romance, he finally snapped at him that things like love and dating made no sense to him.</p><p>So what did Tanaka Juri do?</p><p>He offered to take him on a date.</p><p>A fake one.</p><p>For the sake of writing.</p><p>Juri had arrived at his dorm room door and before he dragged him out to see a movie. After, Taiga was taken to a family restaurant dinner where the other grinned and laughed as he joked about how bad the movie was. As much as he wanted to resist it, Taiga laughed too because the movie truly had been just that bad as he ate the curry Juri offered to pay for.</p><p>He had fun… but it was hard to say if it was really because it was a date or if it was because he had an unexpectedly good time with a new friend.</p><p>Love and romance still didn't make sense.</p><p>And on the way home back to campus, when Taiga felt the touch of Juri's fingers between his, he ripped his hand away.</p><p>Juri had chuckled and held out his out again.</p><p>"Come on, there's nothing to be embarrassed about."</p><p>"It's just pretend. Just try to picture someone who's in love."</p><p>There was a beat of silence before Juri refused any of his protests, and without a way out, Taiga hesitantly placed his hand in his, letting Juri shift their hands to slip their fingers together in a tight hold.</p><p>It was embarrassing. But it was even more embarrassing having the lover's hold through campus as if there was nothing strange at all. Taiga had heard his heart pounding in his chest as they warmed each other's fingers which had grown cold from the night breeze.</p><p>Why it was pounding, he didn't know.</p><p>At the time, he blamed it on the fear of someone he knew seeing the two of them act so foolishly as the pretend dating didn't seem to stop even weeks after the pretend date was over.</p><p>While Taiga wrote, Juri would play with the ends of his hair, messily setting the longest strands in braids or use Taiga's body as a resting post as he read. Juri still took him places on days off and had his frequent afternoon naps on his lap where Taiga found himself lulled to sleep by his slow even breathing.</p><p>Each time, Taiga flinched away from him less and less, growing used to Juri's fingers on his skin as he lied to himself that it was for the betterment of his writing.</p><p>Not because he found comfort in Juri's touch.</p><p>As Taiga wrote the beginnings of what would be "Sapphire Bloom", he wasn't really sure what he was writing besides that it was supposed to be a romance. He did his best to write what he thought people found enjoyable in a relationship as Juri had told him to do. Going on dates. Hugging. Kissing. Laughing.</p><p>It felt stiff.</p><p>It had no life.</p><p>Juri confirmed it too when he read it.</p><p>He had laughed and given him a forgiving smile, squeezing his knee as he sat beside him.</p><p>"Don't think about it so hard… Just write how you feel. Even if it doesn't make sense."</p><p>So he did.</p><p>Taiga just wrote how he felt.</p><p>Taiga wrote how it felt to have someone warm your hands. He wrote how it felt when someone shared your laughter. He wrote how it felt when someone was there when you fell asleep and he wrote how it felt when you woke up with someone beside you.</p><p>It felt stupid.</p><p>He didn't think it had the depth of what it was like when someone was truly in love, but when Juri read it, he beamed as he grabbed Taiga's shoulders and pulled him in for a tight hug.</p><p>Taiga jumped, shocked and surprised, unsure what to do with his hands as Juri set heavy pats onto his back.</p><p>"I knew it," Taiga heard Juri say over his shoulder.</p><p>"I knew you were the one."</p><p>Taiga could feel Juri's heart against his chest.</p><p>He wondered if he could feel his.</p><p>Taiga wrapped his arms around him and buried his face into his neck as Juri rubbed his back.</p><p>"Your writing is truly amazing, Kyomo," Juri said in a soft voice, using the nickname only he used.</p><p>"I knew you could do it."</p><p>After several edits and sleepless nights, they were able to meet the deadline for the short story anthology. The publication was printed once a year by their university, including poetry, art, sculpture and, of course, writing. For someone to have their piece included was high praise as it was selected from hundreds of entries. Being chosen meant their piece was one of the unspoken favorites of the professors who had meticulously reviewed each before picking which to be added.</p><p>Unlike Juri, Taiga hadn't expected much. He wasn't majoring in writing, though his classes had required him to read many.</p><p>If he wasn't selected, he wouldn't have been heartbroken about it. Sure, hours of work would have come to nothing. Most of the entries were either class assignments or class assignments that were required to be submitted, so those students hadn't spent free time to write something like he had as their writing had another purpose.</p><p>But it didn't matter to him.</p><p>The time spent writing it was worth more than the reward.</p><p>Amazingly, Sapphire Bloom was the third story of 5 that were included in the book.</p><p>The placement of the stories were in no particular order, despite what Juri believed as he claimed that the middle was the best placement since most curious people opened books from the center.</p><p>"It's the first thing they see!" Juri exclaimed as they walked through campus, the book flapping open and closed in his hands as he demonstrated it to him.</p><p>The book was so newly printed that the spine creaked when it opened, the pages of Taiga's story fluttering at its center.</p><p>Taiga laughed.</p><p>He didn't even know how big his grin was when Juri laughed with him.</p><p>"It doesn't matter if it's first or last," Taiga said once his laughter settled, the smile still on his lips.</p><p>"I'm happy we did it together."</p><p>Juri chuckled, throwing his arm over Taiga's shoulder with the book still clutched in his hand.</p><p>"Me too, Kyomo."</p><p>"Thank you for giving me a chance."</p><p>When they graduated, Juri submitted the book to his internship as a reference for his application for a full time job.</p><p>Juri encouraged Taiga to submit his writing for publication, promising that his new position would help his book go through, though as a fresh employee, he didn't have any more sway than the secretary who had been there for years.</p><p>Taiga did it anyway.</p><p>There was no shame in trying.</p><p>A few weeks later, Juri arrived at Taiga's apartment with a bottle of wine and his contract to be signed.</p><p>And after the success of Sapphire Bloom, Taiga was asked to write another romance novel.</p><p>It should have been simple. He did it once before, he could do it once again, right?</p><p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you that I'm being transferred to the Osaka branch."</p><p>Taiga nearly choked on his beer as Juri placed more meat on the grill between them, cooking for the both of them as he always did at their favorite yakiniku place.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"They were impressed with my work so they wanted me to work with one of the well experienced chief editors down there. They said they wanted to maximize my potential."</p><p>Taiga's grip tightened on his cup, staring at Juri who was dressed for work, his top layer off and his tie tucked in his breast pocket as he placed the finished beef onto his plate.</p><p>"... What did you say?"</p><p>Juri smiled to himself, placing his own serving on his plate.</p><p>"I said yes, of course."</p><p>At the end of the night, Taiga told Juri congratulations to which Juri responded by giving him a hug around the shoulders and saying thanks.</p><p>"It's all thanks to you."</p><p>Taiga couldn't bring himself to ask about what would happen to him.</p><p>It would have been selfish to ask "what about the new book you're doing with me?" or "who's going to take your place?" when Juri was on such a high.</p><p>He couldn't ask "what will happen to us?"</p><p>Why did you pull me in to leave me by myself?</p><p>What about me?</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>It wasn't about him.</p><p>He wanted Juri to be happy.</p><p>Taiga helped Juri move and waved goodbye when he left after receiving a hug he didn't want to let go of. He went home, flipping on the lights of his empty apartment and did the only thing he could do.</p><p>He wrote.</p><p>At least he tried to.</p><p>The first couple weeks were okay. He wrote as he always did, typing out just the beginnings of the new book he and Juri had thought of together.</p><p>Juri texted every so often. He would send pictures of his new place, his food and the bright lights of the city. The texts slowed as his work became busy.</p><p>But, slowly, it became difficult.</p><p>Taiga couldn't think of anything.</p><p>Writing became empty.</p><p>Pointless.</p><p>A month after Juri had left, he sent a picture of his room the morning after a party, joking about how much of a mess it was with the cans of beer littering the small apartment and left over food abandoned on the table.</p><p>In the back, Taiga saw a pair of bright red heels by the door.</p><p>Taiga didn't text back.</p><p>The texts stopped.</p><p>Finally, after weeks of silence and cups of alcohol were drained into his stomach, Taiga stood up and walked away from his work.</p><p>When he came back, he printed every page, watching the machine spit out the papers before he read every word.</p><p>It was like someone else had written it.</p><p>Even without the vodka in his blood, Taiga couldn't recognize the words on the pages or their purpose.</p><p>It was supposed to be a romance, but it was just two people aimlessly dancing around each other, and for what reason?</p><p>Love?</p><p>Affection?</p><p>Marriage?</p><p>Children?</p><p>It felt pointless. Useless. Empty as Taiga wasn't even sure himself. Even when he read through the outline Juri had typed up for him, it was heartless when it once seemed so full of life.</p><p>Taiga roughly collected the pages and threw them all away, the stack fluttering apart, falling and sinking to the bottom of the bin as Taiga went to his computer, not looking back.</p><p>He closed the document.</p><p>He closed the outline.</p><p>His mind blank as he dragged the files to the trash, watching them disappear as his finger lifted from the mouse.</p><p>There was no point.</p><p>There was no purpose to love.</p><p>It had no place in his life.</p><p>Romance meant nothing.</p><h6></h6><p>"Hokuto? Is something wrong?"</p><p>Hokuto blinked as he finished refilling a customer's glass, a cute young woman dressed in bright colors. From her gold rings and her floral decorated watch, he recognized she had come by a few times before.</p><p>"Oh, pardon me," he smiled. "Of course, I'm perfectly alright. Did I forget to bring something?"</p><p>She frowned, a worried look in her eyes as she placed her hand over his on the glass pitcher.</p><p>"You just seem a little out of it. Your spacey expression is cute, but I just wanted to make sure everything is okay."</p><p>Hokuto laughed warmly as he took her hand into his own, giving it a light squeeze before letting it go. "I'm alright. Thank you for your concern. You're very sweet. Let me know if you need anything, alright?"</p><p>She smiled and gave him a nod which he returned before walking back behind the bar to place the new orders in the window, his own smile gone as soon no one could see.</p><p>As he released the last order sheet from his fingers, his hand slowed before it dropped, fisted on the narrow steel frame.</p><p>It had been a week since Taiga contacted him.</p><p>Hokuto wasn't sure if he would be contacting him this week either.</p><p>After that night, Hokuto wasn't sure what would happen. The rest of the evening, Taiga seemed to be in a daze as it became painfully silent between them with only the sounds of the TV occupying the space.</p><p>Once the episode ended, Hokuto asked if he should go home to which Taiga nodded without sparing him a glance, his eyes still wandering, distracted by his thoughts, as he told him that that would be probably for the best.</p><p>Since then, every sound that even remotely resembled the whistle of a LINE message made Hokuto's hand go to his pocket whether it was actually on his body or not. Each time, he was met with disappointment, it either being a message from someone else or a false alarm.</p><p>Jesse peeked through the service window to see Hokuto on the other side.</p><p>"Hey. Can you come in here for a minute?"</p><p>Hokuto peered back. "Sure. What is it?"</p><p>"Just get in here."</p><p>Hokuto's brow furrowed before walking around to enter the kitchen door. He expected Jesse would need help finishing a dish or fetching something from the pantry, but all he was met with was a shot of cooking sherry.</p><p>"Hmm?" Hokuto looked up from the cup up to his tall friend.</p><p>Jesse lifted his hand, again encouraging Hokuto to take it before pouring another glass.</p><p>"Jesse, what is this?"</p><p>"You just seemed like you needed it."</p><p>Hokuto laughed half heartedly, watching Jesse take the other glass to raise it up to his.</p><p>"Jesse, we're working…"</p><p>"And there's only an hour left before closing. Those are the last orders, right?" He gestured to the new tabs in the window.</p><p>"I guess so."</p><p>"So. Cheers."</p><p>Jesse clinked his shot against Hokuto's, leaving Hokuto with nothing else to do but throw it back, letting it burn down his throat. Hokuto's face scrunched as the alcohol reached his stomach, heating his chest as it went down.</p><p>"You couldn't have at least offered a better drink?" Hokuto hissed as he quickly filled the shot glass with water to chase it.</p><p>Jesse rubbed his tongue over the roof of his mouth, smothering the odd flavor. "Well it was this or cooking wine and what crazy person does shots of wine."</p><p>Hokuto swallowed down the water, rinsing his mouth to ensure the alcohol didn't stick to his breath when he spoke to the customers out front. He spit out the water, quickly washing it away with his head hung over the sink.</p><p>"... Thanks, Jesse."</p><p>Jesse watched his partner for a moment before rubbing his back in wide strokes, chuckling before taking the two glasses to place by the wash.</p><p>"Any day, Hokuto."</p><p>"Unless you want another, let's wrap today up."</p><p>"I'm good…"</p><p>"Then back to work."</p><p>Hokuto straightened himself out as Jesse took the last orders, exhaling through his nose to prepare himself to check on the patrons again.</p><p>But not before checking his phone one more time.</p><p>The screen brightened.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>At least not from the person he wanted to hear from.</p><p>He sighed, restraining himself from taking out his regret on his phone as he set it down gently instead of chucking it at the metal table.</p><p>Despite the anxious stir in his chest, he plastered on a smile to keep the customers from worrying as he let the warm buzz brewing in his stomach take him through the last hour in a flash.</p><p>He pushed forward, presenting a smile as he served the last few orders, following it with dessert with a side of innocent flirting at the end before he finally turned the sign to show "closed".</p><p>The last woman Hokuto escorted to the door turned to him as she stepped outside into the cool air.</p><p>"Are you sure you're not free tonight? It's been so long since we've spent time together."</p><p>Hokuto replied with a soft smile as he held the door open.</p><p>"I'm sorry, not tonight."</p><p>"Next time, then?"</p><p>"Next time, I promise. As long as I'm free."</p><p>He had a feeling he would be a lot more free in the future anyways.</p><p>He closed the door behind her, releasing a deep breath as his hand laid flat against it, clicking it shut. After turning away, when he returned to the kitchen, Jesse was just about done putting all the food preparations away.</p><p>"You can handle sweeping, right?" Jesse called over his shoulder, starting to rinse the dishes for the wash.</p><p>Hokuto nodded as he picked up his phone, barely giving it a glance.</p><p>"Yeah, you go ahead and–..."</p><p>Jesse was listening, but when Hokuto suddenly went silent, his hands paused under the water as he waited, confused.</p><p>"... And? … And what?"</p><p>"I have to go."</p><p>Jesse whipped around to see Hokuto throwing off his apron and heading for the door.</p><p>"Hokuto?? Wait-! What about closing up?!"</p><p>Hokuto held his hand up to his face in a praying motion with his phone still gasped in it. "Please, Jesse. Just this once."</p><p>Jesse didn't really feel like he had a choice as Hokuto was already opening the door.</p><p>"You owe me!" he shouted after him as Hokuto sped out of the restaurant.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Kyomoto:<br/>
<em>Can you come over?</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Kyomoto:<br/>
<em>Tonight?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Hokuto didn't know if he had arrived anywhere faster.</p><p>Even the elevator felt slow as it carried him to Taiga's floor.</p><p>What Taiga wanted him there for, he wasn't sure.</p><p>He just had to be there.</p><p>He wanted to see him.</p><p>Hokuto jammed the key into the lock before prying it open, his chest heaving as his heart raced within it.</p><p>When he finally raised his head once catching his breath, he saw Taiga at the stove with a ladle in his hand.</p><p>The first thing that wanted to spill from Hokuto's mouth was an apology, but he lost his chance when Taiga was the first to speak.</p><p>"... Can you tell me what's wrong with the curry?..."</p><p>Hokuto's mouth stuttered, catching on the words that almost came pouring out before he swallowed them back to adjust himself to answer.</p><p>"U-um… Yeah. Sure."</p><p>He hung his bag on the back of one of the dining room chairs as he walked over.</p><p>"What's wrong with it?"</p><p>Taiga sighed, staring into the pot.</p><p>"It's too runny… It's like soup right now."</p><p>Hokuto grabbed a spoon from the drawer, dabbing just the bottom of its bowl into the curry to watch the way it ran off the metal.</p><p>Well, it was certainly runny.</p><p>"Did you use roux blocks?" Hokuto asked as he placed the spoon on his tongue. The flavor was fine aside from being slightly thin, and as far as he could see, the vegetables and the meat inside seemed to be cooked well.</p><p>"I did…"</p><p>"Did you follow the instructions?..."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"... Kyomoto?"</p><p>Taiga grabbed Hokuto's hand to shove the ladle into it before tearing off his apron as he grumbled. "I didn't, alright?"</p><p>"You eye everything all the time. I thought it would be fine."</p><p>Hokuto gave a sympathetic smile before opening an upper cabinet to look for starch to add to the mix. "How much do you think is in 500 cc?"</p><p>Taiga furrowed his brow as he held out his hands to make a vague shape of what he imagined what 500 milliliters was.</p><p>"I don't know, something like this?"</p><p>Hokuto glanced over to look as he pulled out a clean spoon for the starch. He chuckled as the container came open in his other hand.</p><p>"That's way too much."</p><p>Taiga's hands fell to his lap.</p><p>"You're lying."</p><p>"I'm not."</p><p>"You have to be lying to me," Taiga said as he dug through his drawer for a measuring cup.</p><p>"I wouldn't lie to you."</p><p>Taiga squinted his eyes as he pulled out the steel tool.</p><p>"... It must have shrunk."</p><p>Hokuto laughed, his teeth showing as he smiled. "It didn't shrink!"</p><p>Taiga tossed it back into the mess of his drawer, defeated as he shoved it shut. "Is it fixed yet?"</p><p>"Try it."</p><p>Taiga took the tasting spoon he had been using the stick into the hot curry. When he lifted it, he could see how the roux stuck to the utensil before smoothly slipping off its curve.</p><p>Hokuto looked over to him, watching Taiga place the spoon into his mouth.</p><p>"Better?"</p><p>"... Better… Have you eaten yet?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>"Have some. I made too much anyways."</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>As Hokuto began to reach for the plates, he felt a jab on his leg, only to find Taiga nudging him with his slipper clad foot when he looked down.</p><p>"Just go sit. Let me serve you in my own home for once," Taiga said as he pushed at him again.</p><p>Hokuto blinked as he stepped aside to let Taiga take his place in grabbing the plates from the shelf.</p><p>"Go get whatever you want to drink and sit down."</p><p>"Oh- Okay."</p><p>It had been a long time since he had been served outside of a restaurant, or even within his own house or other's. Usually others were happy to pass the job to him, but Taiga somehow always seemed to oppose his expectations.</p><p>After days of worry, Hokuto felt at ease at Taiga's side.</p><p>Back at his side.</p><p>"Do you want cold tea?" Hokuto asked as he opened Taiga's fridge, now rather acquainted with it after his repeated use of it.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Hokuto plucked the drink pitcher from the door shelf to bring to the island where they ate, bringing two glasses along with it.</p><p>When Taiga set down the plates, loaded with curry and rice, he saw Hokuto filling the cups.</p><p>"You can't help yourself, can you?..."</p><p>Hokuto smiled to himself as Taiga went to get spoons for them.</p><p>"It's just reflex, I guess."</p><p>They sat down to eat, saying their thank yous before digging their spoons in.</p><p>The ratio was a little off. There was far more curry than rice on the plate, almost swallowing the white grains Taiga had scooped into the dish. But the rice was delicious on its own. Out of all the things Taiga had learned to do, was making a balanced pot of rice. He had taken pride in it, making Hokuto try it plain whenever he came over as he improved it day by day.</p><p>The vegetables were cooked evenly and the pork was tender, though Hokuto could tell Taiga had bought it pre-sliced. Overall, it was a decent curry. Box made, yes, but it still had a good taste and was filling for the stomach.</p><p>"It's good."</p><p>"Really?..."</p><p>"Mhm," Hokuto hummed as he took another bite. "Maybe it could use some dimension, but for box curry, it's good."</p><p>Taiga pursed his lips before jamming more of his food into his mouth, hiding the smile that wanted to grow on his lips.</p><p>They ate quietly as their plates slowly became empty, aside from the one or two refills of rice used to finish what was left of the curry.</p><p>Taiga set down his cup, but his hand didn't return to his spoon as Hokuto continued to eat across from him, cutting the soft potato with the edge of his spoon before dragging it through the curry and rice for a perfect bite.</p><p>"... You were right."</p><p>Hokuto glanced up, pulling the spoon from his lips.</p><p>Taiga stared down at his dish, stripes of what was left of his curry streaked around it with the stained rice laying on the side.</p><p>"I'm in love with Juri."</p><p>"... I think."</p><p>There was a pause, a tense feeling growing between them as Hokuto set down his spoon, it clinking softly against the porcelain.</p><p>Hokuto took in a deep breath before releasing it slowly through his nose in the silence.</p><p>"... And?"</p><p>"... What are you going to do?"</p><p>Taiga swallowed the lump in his throat.</p><p>"I… I don't know."</p><p>Taiga dropped down his spoon as he put his hand over his eyes, pushing his glasses up and shifting them askew. He held his face while letting out a sharp deep sigh.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>"I don't know what to do. I just know that when I'm around him, it feels good… I don't really know if it's-... love… or whatever, I just know that it hurt when he was gone."</p><p>"But now when I see him, my stomach feels sick and it makes me want to throw up... Is that how it's supposed to feel?"</p><p>"It's a little different for everyone."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Taiga peeked over at Hokuto through his fingers to see him eating as just as he was before.</p><p>"... I thought you would have reacted differently…"</p><p>"How did you think I would act?"</p><p>Taiga sighed as his hand fell from his eyes and the other ran through his hair to take his glasses. "I don't know. I thought you would laugh and tell me 'I told you so' or pick on me for liking Juri."</p><p>"Maybe," Taiga corrected at the end.</p><p>"Well isn't it a good thing?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Hokuto took his glass, looking into his drink.</p><p>"You said that you didn't understand romance. Isn't this your chance to finally find out?"</p><p>Taiga frowned as he took his spoon to scrape it over his plate, the leftover curry collecting on its edge.</p><p>"... He's taking me out to dinner in two weeks…"</p><p>Hokuto set down his empty glass.</p><p>"Why in two weeks?"</p><p>"It's the same day my first novel was published…"</p><p>Taiga looked embarrassed as he crossed his arms on the counter with his fingers playing with the edge of his sleeve.</p><p>"Um… Matsumura…"</p><p>Hokuto picked up his plate and cup as he stood to take them to the sink.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"... You know stuff about clothes… right?"</p><h6></h6><p>"You look good."</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>"Huh? Oh- uh… Yeah… Thanks."</p><p>Juri smiled as he opened the door to the restaurant he had reserved for them, letting Taiga step in first.</p><p>"Did you have someone help you pick this out? I don't think I've seen you wear something like this before." Juri quickened his step to catch up to Taiga's pace after holding the door for a woman and her child who followed after Taiga, setting his hand gently on the small of his back as he gave his outfit a look up and down.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Who was it?" Juri asked as he told the hostess their reservation.</p><p>"It's a secret..."</p><p>Juri laughed. "A secret? Alright. Then I won't ask."</p><p>Taiga looked down at himself while Juri complemented the hostess' necklace as she brought them to their table.</p><p>The suit that Hokuto picked out was able to impress Juri, but it felt so constraining on his body.</p><p>He had never spent so much time on what he wore.</p><p>His wardrobe was really just a repeated copy of the same things in different forms. Black shirt. Blue shirt. Black jacket. Black hoodie. Black sweatpants. Grey sweatpants. Black shorts.</p><p>A lot of it was black… Aside from the rare colored shirts or tops, black was a color he heavily relied on. He did have the couple of flannels and coats that could make his outfit just a bit more visually appealing, but otherwise there was no better word to describe his closet than plain.</p><p>He simply didn't care.</p><p>He still didn't.</p><p>If he had to dress up for a meeting, he would rather skip the meeting completely than put on the ill-fitting suit that he's had for years.</p><p>But Juri had asked him to dress "nice" for their dinner.</p><p>So he had to find something better than a T-shirt and athletic pants.</p><p>Taiga had started at his closet, observing the monochromatic color shades it contained and figured it would probably be best to just try to buy something else rather than battle with what his closet was already lacking. At first online shopping seemed like the best option as actually having to leave his home to go find clothes was by far the last thing he wanted to do, but as he stared at the pages and pages of shirts, shoes and pants, he realized he had no idea what he was looking at.</p><p>Weren't there colors that aren't supposed to be worn together? What about patterns? Were there patterns that looked better with each other? Was all of this stuff really what was in style? Was he even dressing within his age? What was a man in his mid to late 20s even supposed to be wearing nowadays?</p><p>After subduing the headache he got with painkillers and sleep, he tried again.</p><p>He started with calling Kochi.</p><p>Taiga had thought that Kochi had to have some kind of advice that was better than the absolute nothing he was starting with. He really thought there would have been some knowledge to gain, but as they continued to talk, it became glaringly apparent that Kochi's clothing repertoire really only fell under outdoors and camping.</p><p>Not really helpful.</p><p>Kochi had certifications in life activities. Not fashion.</p><p>And even before Taiga could start to consider texting his previous editor, he could see the scenario play out in his mind's eye.</p><p>She would surely laugh at his confusion before making remarks about how she had always told him his outfits were bad and just the thought of shopping with her made the energy drain from Taiga's body.</p><p>So this left him with two options, either Juri or Hokuto.</p><p>Which really meant that his only option was Hokuto.</p><p>As far as Taiga could interpret, Hokuto dressed well. He always seemed to be put together when he came over, including the "date but not date". Even the outfit Taiga asked him to pick out to save him from embarrassment when out shopping seemed to be carefully put together.</p><p>While Hokuto pulled more options from the racks in the store, Taiga felt like he was looking at a stranger as he stood in front of the dressing room mirror. He never thought that just a well fitting button up shirt was enough to change everything.</p><p>With Hokuto's guidance and help, the shopping trip was far less painful than it would have been. And maybe Taiga had just the barest amount of fun.</p><p>Hokuto seemed like he was having fun too.</p><p>"So, have you gotten used to it yet?"</p><p>Taiga looked up at Juri across from him as he sat down at their table with a view of the city below them.</p><p>"What?...  Oh. You mean this?"</p><p>Taiga lifted his fringe with his fingers, the dark color was now a bright blonde.</p><p>Juri had dragged him out of the house to get his haircut just a few days before, exerting his opinion that Taiga's hair was too long as a fact.</p><p>Juri told him a fresh cut could help open his mind and that a light color would brighten his world as he led him into his car, and by the time Taiga sat in the salon chair, he couldn't bring himself to say no as the hairdresser was already throwing the cape around his neck.</p><p>His recent revelations didn't help either as he let Juri convince him to go blonde.</p><p>The next morning, he almost scared himself in the mirror.</p><p>"Um… It's alright. I can't exactly say it suits me though…" Taiga sighed as he opened the menu.</p><p>… When did salads get so expensive?...</p><p>The place was incredibly extravagant.</p><p>Taiga couldn't begin to imagine how expensive it was. Juri was the same person, but the amount of money he spent was strikingly different from his frugal days in college.</p><p>"I think it matches," Juri chuckled, the menu laying casually in his hand as he rested his chin in his palm. "It really lightens up your whole image."</p><p>Taiga prayed his face didn't turn red.</p><p>"Well… Thank you… I guess…"</p><p>"You're welcome." Juri smiled as he sat back in his lavish seat.</p><p>"Hokuto couldn't convince you to use contacts though?"</p><p>Taiga mumbled barely loud enough for Juri to hear.</p><p>"... They didn't come in time."</p><p>"So it was Hokuto who helped you."</p><p>Taiga nearly stubbed his toe into the table leg underneath when he flinched and dropped the menu he had been using to hide his face. "No! I-"</p><p>His head whipped around after his voice had been just a bit too loud for a nice restaurant. He adjusted his tone, clearing his throat, and started again.</p><p>"No. Well… Yes. He did help. A little."</p><p>Hokuto had helped a lot. It could even be said he did all of the work, but Taiga wasn't going to admit that in front of Juri.</p><p>Juri laughed as his lips formed his large grin.</p><p>The grin that made Taiga's chest warm.</p><p>Juri set down his menu to unfold the cloth napkin from his plate. "It doesn't matter to me. I was wondering what Hokuto thought of your hair if he saw it."</p><p>Taiga slowly hid himself with his menu again.</p><p>When Hokuto arrived at his door to take him shopping, Taiga caught him turning his gaze away as he was putting on the clothes Hokuto had pulled out of his closet for him.</p><p>He asked him if it was weird or if it looked bad.</p><p>From his delayed response and his silence before reaching the elevator, Taiga figured Hokuto had struggled to form a compliment.</p><p>"Hard to say…" Taiga muttered behind his menu. "He said it looked good, but he was weird about it when he said it."</p><p>Juri smiled as he waved down a waiter. "That's Hokuto for you. Always bad with words."</p><p>… Was he?</p><p>From what Taiga had seen, his tongue was always sharp and always had the right thing to say.</p><p>Whenever Juri talked about Hokuto, it was like he was speaking of a whole different person. It didn't make sense how someone could change so quickly.</p><p>But people change, Taiga guessed.</p><p>"Wine?"</p><p>Taiga looked over his menu to see Juri holding the thorough drink menu which didn't list a single price.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>The low pendant light reflected through the wine glass as Juri held it by the base with his fingers, letting the waiter who had returned with a bottle of red pour the deep color into the crystal. When Taiga set his own forward, Juri took it from him for it to be filled before handing it back with his raised, patiently waiting for Taiga to gently chime his glass with his own as he smiled.</p><p>"Happy anniversary to our first child, Kyomoto Taiga."</p><p>If Taiga hadn't felt so nervous, he would have laughed, but it didn't keep his lips from tugging up at the corners as he took a sip.</p><p>"It's just a book, Juri."</p><p>"That doesn't mean that it's not worth celebrating."</p><p>They talked for a while, the alcohol loosening their lips as they discussed the menu and awaited their incoming meals. It was easy to talk to Juri as it always had been, laughing and smiling when a joke was made or focusing when approached with honesty, but Taiga couldn't get a nagging out from the back of his mind.</p><p>Was… this supposed to be romantic?...</p><p>By all reason, this could have just been another dinner with a friend that was using the anniversary of his book as an excuse to gussy it up. It could very well just be Juri having fun with his recent wealth.</p><p>If it had been anyone else besides Juri, Taiga would have thought it was exactly that.</p><p>But because it was Juri sitting across from him, he couldn't ignore the moody dim lighting and the light jazz played by the live band on the small stage. He couldn't help but have his eyes catch on the passing and dining guests that were dressed up in suits and fine dresses as they talked leisurely over their overpriced food that was only truly reserved for special occasions unless they had pockets full of money ready to burn.</p><p>Taiga couldn't not notice that Juri offered to pay for their meal.</p><p>He just couldn't help but feel that it was a bit more than just celebrating an anniversary.</p><p>But it wasn't, of course.</p><p>Taiga knew it wasn't, but it didn't keep his mind from racing as he smiled when Juri reflected with him on their past, pretending he wasn't trying to convince himself on the inside to not expect anything more. He could barely taste his steak as Juri mused over how much he missed him and Tokyo while his head wouldn't stop reeling.</p><p>"Actually, Kyomo, I have a bit of a surprise for us," Juri said, smiling as he handed the waiter his card.</p><p>The mantra Taiga had crafted during their meal repeated in his head.</p><p>It's nothing.</p><p>It's nothing.</p><p>It's <em>nothing</em>.</p><p>It's normal.</p><p>He took his nearly empty glass to drink from what was left.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"It'll be here in just a second."</p><p>When the waiter returned to set a plate before him, the cake that sat atop it was incredible. It was so carefully and precisely shaped, decorated with a drizzle that was described as something much more complicated than just chocolate by the waiter and a shmeer made with an overly complicated processed fruit jam.</p><p>In movies, this kind of thing would have surely been paired with a deep confession and a ring displayed perfectly at its center.</p><p>Before his thoughts could wander any further, Taiga dug his fork into its middle, roughly splitting it in half.</p><p>"Hey, Kyomo?"</p><p>When Taiga looked across from him, Juri was watching him with his own dessert untouched in front of him.</p><p>His hand was nowhere near his small silver fork as Taiga's left his lips.</p><p>He swallowed hard, pressing the smooth cake and mousse into the roof of his mouth as he prayed for his mind to shut up and stop working for just a moment.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>
  <em>Stop.</em>
</p><p>It's <em>nothing</em>.</p><p>This isn't anything more than it was.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>Juri gave him a nervous smile as he faced him head on, his hands in his lap.</p><p>All Taiga could bring himself to do was to cut into the cake again, ruining the clean patterned drizzle before dragging the piece through the jam shmear.</p><p>"There's something I've been keeping from you since I came back."</p><p>The words pounded through Taiga's head as their eyes met.</p><p>It's not that.</p><p>It can't be <em>that</em>.</p><p>"There's another reason why I came back to Tokyo."</p><p>It can't be.</p><p>There's no <em>way</em> it would be.</p><p>"You know I care about you."</p><p>It couldn't be a confession.</p><p>It couldn't be.</p><p>There's no way it would be.</p><p>There was no way that Juri was about to tell him how he felt about him.</p><p>It couldn't.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>........ Right?</p><p>Juri took his hand into his own, the fork in Taiga's fingers falling to the plate below it as a shiver shot up his spine.</p><p>"I want you to know."</p><p>Taiga's breath caught in his throat as he waited for Juri's next words.</p><p>There were millions of things that could have come from Juri's lips.</p><p>That he bought a house. That he bought a dog. Or a cat. Or a bird. Or maybe he quit smoking. Maybe that he was moving back permanently. That he got another promotion or was even moving companies..</p><p>It could have been anything.</p><p>Anything at all.</p><p>But for a split second, Taiga had hoped it was that one thing.</p><p>That one thing he couldn't understand.</p><p>He thought for a moment that maybe he could try.</p><p>If it was Juri, he could try.</p><p>If Juri had said the words he had denied all night.</p><p>If it all had actually been true.</p><p>But he was wrong.</p><p>Taiga's breath stopped as a warm smile curled on Juri's lips.</p><p>"Kyomo."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I'm getting married."</p><h6></h6><p>Hokuto stirred in his sleep when he heard a knock at his door.</p><p>He let out a deep sigh from his nose as he glanced at his clock.</p><p>It was just about 10 pm.</p><p>He forgot he had tried to sleep early to quiet his mind as the knock sounded on the door again.</p><p>It had to be her.</p><p>No one came at this time besides her.</p><p>Hokuto rubbed his eyes for a moment before throwing off his covers to step out of bed. He grabbed the zip up he had thrown over his chair to tug onto himself as he went to answer the door, the sleep still in his eyes.</p><p>"You know, I told you to call before–..."</p><p>His voice faded and trailed off as the door came open.</p><p>"...... Hey."</p><p>Taiga's voice was so soft, he could barely hear it.</p><p>Hokuto looked at his eyes that were trained on the ground between them as the quiet sounds of the night whispered behind him.</p><p>"... Hey."</p><p>Taiga's hand clutched into the sleeve of the suit he had helped him select as his feet shifted.</p><p>"... Um…"</p><p>"Were you… expecting someone?..."</p><p>Hokuto stumbled over his words for a second.</p><p>"Uh– No. No… Not really…"</p><p>Taiga's eyes still wouldn't meet his.</p><p>"Can I come in?..."</p><p>Hokuto moved back and opened the door wide.</p><p>"Yeah… Of course."</p><p>Hokuto watched Taiga remove his shoes, unsure what to do.</p><p>"Do you want something to drink? Or-..."</p><p>"Do you have whiskey?"</p><p>"Downstairs. I can get it. Do you want ice?"</p><p>"No. It's fine."</p><p>"Okay. Go ahead and sit down, I'll be right back."</p><p>Hokuto grabbed his keys and slipped on his shoes before going downstairs to the restaurant bar. He took two glasses before pulling one of their better bottles of alcohol.</p><p>His hand tightened around the neck of the bourbon as he made his way back up the stairs.</p><p>… What the hell happened?...</p><p>Tonight was the night Taiga had his dinner with Juri, but what reason could he possibly have for him to be here?</p><p>With him.</p><p>Shouldn't he still be with Juri?</p><p>No matter what was going on, it worried him and it only managed to worsen as he saw Taiga sitting at the small table in his room, emptily gazing out his dark window that held nothing but street lights.</p><p>Hokuto tore his gaze away from him as he quietly set down the glasses on the table, the cork squeaking softly as he pulled it from the mouth to begin pouring the amber drink.</p><p>"... How much do you-"</p><p>"Juri's engaged."</p><p>Hokuto's wrist lifted.</p><p>After the last escaping drop fell into the cup below, the room went dead silent.</p><p>Hokuto looked up at Taiga, his eyes still empty as they stayed trained on the window.</p><p>"... Huh?..."</p><p>"... He has a girlfriend?..."</p><p>Taiga inhaled sharply as if he hadn't been breathing this whole time.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>His voice that had been so quiet that it was nearly a whisper suddenly filled the room as he released his breath with it.</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>Taiga grabbed the glass, his lips shaping a cold smile as he kicked back the glass.</p><p>Hokuto could only watch.</p><p>"He got her pregnant so she convinced him to marry. Amazing, right?"</p><p>Taiga filled his voice with false cheer as he held out his glass for more, Hokuto obediently pouring again as Taiga's volume raised as if it'd make his excitement more authentic.</p><p>"For as long as I've known him, he's always said that he doesn't want to get married and he can't even imagine settling down. After 5 long years he arrives on my doorstep a changed man and just like that, he invites me to this <em>stupid</em> fancy dinner to tell me that he's finally tying the knot. Isn't that just hilarious??"</p><p>Taiga swallowed down the second glass, slamming down his cup for another which Hokuto didn't fill.</p><p>"He sets all of this up. Just to tell me he's getting married. What a piece of work!"</p><p>Taiga bit out each word. He clenched his teeth as his mask began to slip, his joy morphing into anger. His smile slowly breaking.</p><p>He spoke through his teeth.</p><p>"Tanaka Juri…"</p><p>"<em>Fucking</em> Tanaka Juri…"</p><p>"I'm so happy for him…"</p><p>"I'm so <em>god<strong>damn</strong></em> over the moon."</p><p>Taiga swallowed hard, trying to smother the shake in his voice before speaking again.</p><p>"Come on, Matsumura! Let's have a drink for Tanaka Juri!"</p><p>He cheered in voice only as he reached out to grab the bottle. "To Juri and his marriage!"</p><p>Hokuto placed his hand over Taiga's, keeping him from taking the bourbon.</p><p>"Kyomoto."</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>Taiga's voice rose as he stood to tug against Hokuto's grip and gave a laugh like everything was just fun and games.</p><p>"What??"</p><p>"What's so wrong with being happy for my friend? My long time friend is finally getting married! He's your friend too!"</p><p>"Why would I want to do anything else but be ecstatic for him and his new <em>wife</em>!"</p><p>Taiga nearly snapped out the last word.</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>"I'm just so excited!! I'm so excited to see him walk down that aisle! Can you believe he even asked me to write his vows too?! I'm just so god damn <em>fucking</em> ha-!!"</p><p>"Kyomoto!!!"</p><p>When Hokuto shouted, Taiga finally went silent after it broke him from his blindsighted speech.</p><p>Taiga stared at his hands on the neck of the bottle, stunned as his weighted breath came and left his lips.</p><p>He dropped down into his chair with Hokuto's hands still wrapped tightly around his, his eyes still blank in his shock.</p><p>A lump grew in his throat as eyes began to sting.</p><p>"... Don't laugh…"</p><p>Hokuto's gentle voice almost stung.</p><p>"Why would I laugh?"</p><p>Taiga hung his head, forcing empty laughter in an attempt to save himself any dignity.</p><p>"I always talk about how useless love is. I've fought with you about stupid it is. Now here I am, a mess over it. You can laugh. Go ahead… Laugh all you want..."</p><p>"I wouldn't laugh at that."</p><p>"You're lying."</p><p>Hokuto's fingers tightened around his.</p><p>"I would never lie to you…"</p><p>Hokuto could feel Taiga's hands begin to quiver under his.</p><p>"... Is it…. Is it really okay?..."</p><p>In the silence, the sound of Taiga's tears falling onto his lap was crystal clear.</p><p>His breath shook as his words could barely escape his throat.</p><p>"... Is it really okay for someone like me who doesn't understand love to cry over someone?..."</p><p>Hokuto couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>He couldn't hold back this time.</p><p>He let go.</p><p>He scooped Taiga into his arms.</p><p>Taiga broke apart in his arms as Hokuto pressed his head against his shoulder, knocking his glasses askew and clattering to the ground.</p><p>Taiga began to sob.</p><p>Hokuto cradled his head as he held him close, regardless if Taiga held him back or not.</p><p>"It's okay."</p><p>"It's okay…"</p><p>Taiga filled his fists with Hokuto's hoodie and shirt, clutching at his chest as he soaked his tears into his shoulder.</p><p>"I… I was such an idiot–!!" Taiga's voice cracked, his tears refusing to stop. "It was so stupid of me–!!... How could it have ever been anything!... I'm so– I'm so–!!"</p><p>Hokuto's fingers tangled in Taiga's hair.</p><p>"No, you did nothing wrong."</p><p>"It's okay."</p><p>"It's okay…"</p><p>Taiga cried, his breath ragged as Hokuto held him tight against his chest.</p><p>"I s-should have n-never–..."</p><p>"I shouldn't h-have ever—......"</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>When Juri told him, his mind went blank.</p><p>All he could do was laugh and tell him "Congratulations. When's the wedding?"</p><p>His mind that was so full of buzzing thoughts and worries was suddenly empty. He couldn't think of anything.</p><p>Only Juri's words echoed in his head.</p><p>Tanaka Juri was getting married.</p><p>The same Tanaka Juri that said that he never wanted to settle down.</p><p>The same Juri who said he had more fun being next to him.</p><p>Who's smile now made his stomach feel sick.</p><p>The rest of the night, Taiga felt like his body was on autopilot, behaving how it should be and not how it really felt, laughing, smiling, telling his friend again, how truly and genuinely happy he was for him.</p><p>When Juri offered him a ride home, he turned it down, saying there was somewhere he wanted to go before heading home.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Like anyone had a place they needed to go at 9:38 pm.</p><p>He just couldn't be in that car with him.</p><p>Once the car pulled away, he walked.</p><p>Taiga didn't know where, his feet just moved for him.</p><p>… Was it really love?</p><p>Honestly, Taiga still wasn't sure.</p><p>It felt like it could have been, but that was only by what he had been told.</p><p>Was he really in love or was he just shoving his feelings into a rose colored box to make it seem like it was?</p><p>Love was supposed to be wonderful and beautiful. It was supposed to be something unlike any other. It was supposed to make someone feel like they were on a high and that nothing in the world could hurt them as long as that someone was at their side.</p><p>That's what Taiga thought.</p><p>He thought.</p><p>But there was only an ache that grew bigger with each step as he walked.</p><p>It was horrible.</p><p>And when he saw the entrance of that decorated alleyway, his feet moved by themselves.</p><p>He didn't get it.</p><p>Just what was so good about love?</p><p>Was it really worth all these tears?</p><p>Taiga clenched his teeth as he buried his face into the fabric of Hokuto's hood, gasping as he tried to control his breath. He let Hokuto bring them to the floor as Hokuto curled him into his lap, Taiga's hold not loosening around him for a second.</p><p>Taiga cried until he had no tears left, leaving only his quiet sniffling and the hiccups lingering in his breath.</p><p>The whole time he cried, Hokuto held him.</p><p>Even as the tears slowed and Taiga's grip weakened to a fragile hold, he held him.</p><p>He just let Taiga cry.</p><p>There wasn't much else he could do.</p><p>Taiga was crying over a love he didn't know he had, only to have it torn apart as soon as he gave it a chance. Any words of comfort or reassurance weren't worth anything to a newly broken heart.</p><p>So Hokuto held him. He felt his pain, listening to him cry as his heart stung for him.</p><p>With maybe just a bit of it being his own.</p><p>Hokuto rubbed Taiga's arm, smooth and rhythmically as Taiga's ragged breath slowly became soft and steady, slowly drifting off with his energy spent on his tears.</p><p>And when Taiga's fingers finally slipped from his clothes, Hokuto knew he was asleep.</p><p>For just a second, Hokuto tightened his arms around him, letting his nose bury in his new clothes for just a moment before easing Taiga into his arms.</p><p>His mind wandered as he laid him down in his bed.</p><p>Really.</p><p>What did you do with love?</p><p>Was it really all worth it?...</p><p>Hokuto carefully eased Taiga out of his suit jacket, smoothing his arms out from the sleeves before gently holding the back of his neck to not wake him as he removed it from under him.</p><p>What was love?</p><p>Hokuto began to wonder if he truly knew.</p><p>The tie came smoothly from its knot as Hokuto loosened it and slipped it out from under his collar. He folded it neatly with the suit jacket before undoing the top buttons of Taiga's shirt, each coming easily from their loops to make it more comfortable for his sleep.</p><p>As the last button came undone, a slow breath escaped Hokuto's lips as his palm smoothed over Taiga's chest, feeling the heart that beat steadily within.</p><p>Beat by beat, time passing by with the quiet whispers of the night.</p><p>It was warm.</p><p>And whole.</p><p>And sweet.</p><p>Hokuto gazed over Taiga's swollen eyes as his hand slowly began to reach.</p><p>His fingers followed the curve of Taiga's cheek, Taiga's breath warming his palm as his fingertips nearly threaded with the pale strands.</p><p>But before anything more than the pads of his fingers touched Taiga's skin, he stopped.</p><p>After another beat, his hand withdrew.</p><p>So did his heart.</p><p>Hokuto pulled his blanket over Taiga and went to shut off the lights.</p><p>But not before whispering over the sleeping man in his bed.</p><p>"... I would have never let you cry like this…"</p><h6></h6><p>When Taiga woke up, he woke up to a ceiling he didn't recognize.</p><p>His eyes felt dry and his vision was blurry.</p><p>It felt like a hangover.</p><p>It felt like he had pumped his veins full of poison before pushing his body to act it ways it never had until the adrenaline wore off, bringing him crashing down, left with only ache and numbness the next morning.</p><p>It was numb, but it still hurt.</p><p>For a moment, Taiga felt like he could get through it. With the dulled pain, he could get up and push forward like any other day as long as he didn't think about it. All he needed to do was not think about it.</p><p>But when he saw Hokuto sleeping beside him, the frail will he had taped himself together with came falling apart.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure what it was.</p><p>Maybe it was that Hokuto had put a pillow between them to create distance, or maybe it was the fact that Hokuto only had his own arm to rest his head, giving Taiga the only other one he had.</p><p>Maybe it was just his peaceful image.</p><p>Or maybe it was the feeling or protection Taiga didn't feel he deserved with Hokuto sacrificing his bed and blanket as he slept with only his hoodie to keep him warm.</p><p>Whatever it was, Taiga felt his eyes begin to sting.</p><p>He pulled the pillow between them to his chest as he threw the blanket over both of them best he could before his vision could blur with tears.</p><p>He had slept beside Juri before when he had invited himself to sleep in his dorm.</p><p>But this was different.</p><p>It felt safe.</p><p>"... Are you alright?"</p><p>Despite Hokuto's voice being quiet and gentle as he spoke, Taiga flinched as his fingers dug into the pillow.</p><p>Such a simple question and yet Taiga's tears started all over again.</p><p>It just made all the pain and anger well up back in his throat as Hokuto spoke softly again.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>"I'm sorry…"</p><p>"I promise… things will be okay."</p><p>Taiga's crying only worsened when Hokuto wrapped him back in his hold, his arm tucked under his head with the other wound tightly around his waist, encouraging his tears. He let Hokuto draw his head under his chin as his tears fell and soaked into the pillow in his arms and into Hokuto's sleeve.</p><p>He cried, wrapped in Hokuto's arms just as he had the night before.</p><p>But this time, he could feel Hokuto's warmth. He could feel the way his arms tightened around him when his body shook. He could feel his thumb slowly stroking over the curve of his shoulder.</p><p>He could smell the gentle scent of his skin.</p><p>All of which surely, many others had felt before him.</p><p>Taiga's jaw clenched.</p><p>Hokuto's fingers ran gently through his hair as he spoke into his crown.</p><p>"Please don't cry anymore…"</p><p>"... I'll do anything for you…"</p><p>"Anything…"</p><p>There was a beat before the covers fell to the floor when Taiga planted his hands on Hokuto's chest, shoving him back and breaking from his arms.</p><p>Hokuto blinked, his brow furrowing after as he put his hand over Taiga's on his chest.</p><p>"Kyomoto? Hey, I'm sorry, I-"</p><p>Hokuto was afraid he had crossed a line.</p><p>Maybe he had gotten too comfortable with Taiga depending on him that he got greedy, moving just one step too close.</p><p>Maybe Taiga had figured him all out.</p><p>But when Taiga spoke over him in his small tired voice, he shut his mouth and listened.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Hokuto's gaze followed the tears still rolling from Taiga's eyes as they lowered, his fingers digging into his shirt.</p><p>"You…" he repeated.</p><p>"... Who gives himself to everyone…"</p><p>Taiga's voice began to waver as it weakened, the quiver in his breath starting to show.</p><p>His hands clutched into Hokuto's clothes, collecting it tightly in his fist.</p><p>"Could you…"</p><p>He spoke in barely a whisper, cracking between his words.</p><p>"... Could you spare some for me?..."</p><p>Hokuto lost his breath.</p><p>Taiga pulled, the fabric of Hokuto's shirt becoming taught in his grip as he was blinded by his tears.</p><p>"I… I just… I just want to understand… I want… I want to know what's good for…"</p><p>"I want to know what it feels like…"</p><p>"Even if it means nothing…"</p><p>"Matsumura."</p><p>When Taiga looked up, he closed his eyes tight as Hokuto reached over, fruitlessly wiping the tears from his eyes with his thumb only for them to come flooding back.</p><p>"... Kyomoto."</p><p>A part of him still flinched as Hokuto's hand rested on his cheek with his bracelet slipping down his wrist.</p><p>A part of him still wanted to push it away.</p><p>But it was so warm.</p><p>And gentle.</p><p>And kind as it only started with a feather's touch, waiting for it to be accepted before slowly resting on his skin.</p><p>Taiga could hear the shifting of fabric as Hokuto grew closer, but he didn't need to hear it to know it. He could feel it from the way the tension in his hands loosened and Hokuto's caress smoothed back behind his neck and in his hair.</p><p>He could hear Hokuto's breath.</p><p>He could feel Hokuto's heart against his hold from his chest as Hokuto asked in a whisper.</p><p>"... Will you let me kiss you?..."</p><p>Taiga didn't say yes.</p><p>But nothing about him said no.</p><p>Hokuto believed he found his answer when Taiga met his eyes for the first time since he arrived.</p><p>When he leaned in, he saw the tears trapped in the lashes, he found to be so beautiful, escape as his eyes fluttered closed.</p><p>Taiga wondered if it really even happened.</p><p>He only knew by Hokuto's breath against his lips and the cool that was left by the loss of the touch.</p><p>Hokuto's heart was pounding, throbbing against his rib cage as he kissed him. He swallowed hard when he pulled back, waiting and resisting the overbearing temptation to take another.</p><p>And when Taiga's eyes opened, he couldn't keep himself from asking.</p><p>"... How was it?"</p><p>There were many times when Hokuto met the eyes of a girl he had kissed after they asked him.</p><p>They asked him to kiss <em>them</em>.</p><p>He had seen many things within them after he pulled away.</p><p>Some were full of joy. Others brimming with yearning. Glee. Lust. Embarrassment. Shame. Excitement.</p><p>The list could go on.</p><p>But Taiga was different.</p><p>Because of course he was.</p><p>He had never seen this before.</p><p>After Hokuto had asked <em>him</em>.</p><p>Hokuto felt his chest go cold after it had been so warm as he watched Taiga's gaze wander away from his.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Indifference.</p><p>Taiga's fingers slipped loose from his clothes.</p><p>"... Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Are you leaving already?"</p><p>It was still early in the morning when Hokuto got out of his bed to start dressing himself.</p><p>The woman sharing his bed rolled onto her stomach to watch Hokuto buckle his belt before going through his closet to find a shirt.</p><p>She propped her chin in her hands as her bra strap fell from her shoulder. "I thought you didn't work until later. I was hoping we could have some fun this morning."</p><p>Hokuto flashed her a smile before looking down to tuck in his shirt as he walked back over to the bed beside her. He sat at the edge of the bed as she rolled onto her back to slide her fingers behind his neck.</p><p>His fingers slipped under the thin band of her bra as he leaned over her, smoothing up her arm and gently gliding it in its proper place on her shoulder.</p><p>"Sorry, I have to run some errands this morning, but I really did enjoy our time together." Hokuto spoke in a low tone with his eyes trailing after his fingertips as they traveled down the pretty pink fabric before drawing away.</p><p>"You'll come by again soon, won't you? Sooner than before, I hope."</p><p>She chuckled before grabbing Hokuto's collar to pull him down for a brisk kiss that was much sweeter and gentle than the ones they shared from the night before.</p><p>"If my boyfriend and I fight again, I will be sure to give you a call."</p><p>Hokuto smiled before getting up to grab his bag from the hook by the door.</p><p>"You know to put the keys in the mailbox after locking up, right?"</p><p>The woman smiled as she pulled Hokuto's covers around herself, ready to fall back asleep while Hokuto slipped on his shoes.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Just like last time."</p><h6></h6><p>Hokuto pushed his copy of the key into the lock, quietly undoing the latch and the door, careful to not let the hinges whine with the smile from the morning long faded away.</p><p>As soon as he stepped inside, something inside him carried him to that room.</p><p>He didn't fight it.</p><p>His bags were left abandoned, carelessly dropped by the doorway as he walked, his jacket to fight the early morning chill still on his shoulders.</p><p>The bedroom door was left ajar when Hokuto pushed it open, revealing the man who was still peacefully asleep behind it, curled into his covers. Even disheveled in his sleep, his newly lightened hair gleamed in the strip of sunlight that peaked through his curtains, making him somehow just as beautiful as when he was awake.</p><p>Hokuto walked over, kneeling down beside the bed to just watch.</p><p>Just for a moment.</p><p>He listened to the soft even breaths leave Taiga's chest as he studied the shadows under his eyes that had still yet to fade, his blonde hair falling over them as Taiga shifted in his sleep.</p><p>"... How long have you actually been asleep?"</p><p>Hokuto spoke in a bare whisper to himself as he couldn't keep himself from reaching over and brushing the light strands from Taiga's eyes, only treating himself once with barely brushing his fingers around the back of his ear.</p><p>The touch lingered as Hokuto gazed over him in the silence of the morning, studying the curve of his lips and the length of his lashes.</p><p>Only until Taiga began to stir, his lungs taking in a deep breath as he woke, did Hokuto draw his hand back.</p><p>Taiga's vision was blurry, but even without his glasses, he already knew who was beside his bed. His tired voice croaked through his throat as he let his eyes close again.</p><p>"Hey…"</p><p>The corner of Hokuto's lips tugged up by themselves as Taiga pulled his blanket tighter around himself.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Taiga's speech was muffled as he spoke into the fabric of his blanket.</p><p>"... What time is it?…"</p><p>"8 am."</p><p>There was a grunt before a lifeless hand reached out from under the covers and planted itself flat on Hokuto's chest, receiving only a soft laugh as Hokuto placed his own hand over it.</p><p>The only time Taiga's hands felt warm was in the mornings.</p><p>"... It's too early," Taiga said in a volume Hokuto could hardly hear.</p><p>He responded just as gently with a smile Taiga couldn't see.</p><p>"I'm sorry…"</p><p>The hand drew back, Hokuto holding on to the ends of his fingers just a second longer before they slipped away and pulled back under the down cover, leaving Hokuto's feeling cold.</p><p>"... Breakfast?"</p><p>The blonde mess of hair gave a vague movement Hokuto interpreted as a nod.</p><p>"Any requests?"</p><p>Taiga's voice faded as he spoke, sleep slowly seeping back into his body.</p><p>"French toast…"</p><p>Hokuto waited until Taiga's breath was soft and steady, signalizing his sleep.</p><p>He gave himself a few more seconds with Taiga's sleeping image before getting up, his smile becoming weak.</p><p>"... Okay."</p><p>Ever since that horrible night, the time that Hokuto spent in Taiga's apartment had steadily increased.</p><p>What was once a couple of evenings a week, became multiple mornings, afternoons, evenings and nights where Hokuto would simply sleep on the couch, using one of the few throw blankets Taiga kept under the coffee table.</p><p>Taiga could only assume it was because he felt guilty.</p><p>Hokuto was the one who brought him to believe he felt something for Juri, only to have it all crumble and fall beneath his feet.</p><p>The only way Taiga could bring himself to sleep was to wait until his body no longer had the energy to stay up. Any moment he had in silence was painful as it allowed his brain to drown in the shame and regret for now he felt and what he had thought that night. He did everything he could to keep his mind busy until exhaustion took over. He cooked, he cleaned, he watched TV, played games, listened to music and desperately tried to write to keep himself distracted to the point where he woke up at his desk with a horrible ache in his neck.</p><p>While that did work, the best distraction Taiga had was Hokuto.</p><p>Taiga could focus on the lessons and the food as he emptied his mind, listening to Hokuto's low and careful voice as he filled his curiosities.</p><p>And after the first night Taiga kept him up with him until 3 am, saying "just one more episode" much more than once, Hokuto staying overnight became normal.</p><p>…… Oh, and the kiss?</p><p>There really wasn't much Taiga could say about it.</p><p>After he and Hokuto kissed, Taiga told him it felt like nothing.</p><p>Because it was true.</p><p>It felt like nothing.</p><p>It felt like simply the touching of skin in a strange place.</p><p>No fireworks or sparks like in movies.</p><p>Just an awkward silence before Hokuto nodded and got up out of bed to change. Since then, neither of them mentioned it and nothing else happened. Taiga knew he wasn't going to say anything about it, but Hokuto didn't say anything either.</p><p>Taiga didn't lie when he said he wanted to know, because he truly did even if it was through his tears.</p><p>He wanted to know what love felt like.</p><p>Or at least he wanted to try to know.</p><p>If love was enough to cry over, then he wanted to know what was so amazing about it to make all the tears worth it all, even if he wasn't sure if he could truly ever understand.</p><p>After Juri, he just wanted to know.</p><p>And if it wasn't worth the pain, then Taiga was willing to give up on it forever.</p><p>It would just mean he was right all along.</p><p>Romance and love would just be something not meant for him.</p><p>But whether Hokuto chose to help him with it or not wasn't up to him and was too shameful to ask.</p><p>When the sweet scent from the kitchen wafted into his room, Taiga dragged himself out of bed as only his whining stomach motivated him to pull on a hoodie over his pajamas before making it into his main room.</p><p>He shut his bedroom door behind him, ruffling his messy hair as he pushed his glasses into place on his nose.</p><p>"... Smells good."</p><p>Hokuto glanced over his shoulder before turning back to plate the slice that had properly finished browning in the pan.</p><p>"Has it ever smelled bad?"</p><p>Taiga shrugged to himself as he poured himself coffee from the coffee press that Hokuto had brought and left in his home.</p><p>Ever since Hokuto had taught him how to use a press, his coffee maker went untouched.</p><p>"I guess not…"</p><p>"Can you set the table?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Taiga pulled open the drawer to collect forks and knives as Hokuto finished the last pieces, stacking them neatly before placing them on the kitchen island they ate at.</p><p>"What is it called in French?" Taiga asked as Hokuto set Taiga's breakfast in front of what now felt like "his spot' with Hokuto's own 'spot' across from him. "It can't also be called french toast, right?"</p><p>"It's pain perdu."</p><p>"Oh…" Taiga looked down at his plate.</p><p>"... It looks a bit different from the photos online…"</p><p>"Well, it is a little different," Hokuto said as he settled in his seat. "Traditionally the bread is stale and soaked in the egg mix overnight. It's also preferred to be either a brioche or a challah."</p><p>"The best you had was shokupan and the few hours you were still asleep…"</p><p>"... Don't frown, I promise it will taste the same."</p><p>Taiga didn't even notice that the corners of his lips had turned down as he was looking at the perfectly square slices that were different from the dome shape he had seen when he was scrolling his phone in bed last night.</p><p>He shouldn't complain… After all, Hokuto still had made it after he had asked for it the same morning without warning.</p><p>Taiga smothered the frown from his lips.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>Hokuto gave a small smile before pulling off his apron.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"By the way, I brought your books back. I added the markers as you asked."</p><p>Taiga cut into his toast, marveling at how the crispy outsider crust hid the smooth soft texture of the bread within before looking up and glancing over at the bag of books Hokuto had left in the living room that seemed to hold a mess that only grew bigger day by day.</p><p>"Oh– thanks again…" Taiga said, feeling guilty as he pushed his fork through the crust. "... You really didn't have to do that. I would have gotten to it myself… eventually…"</p><p>Hokuto looked into his coffee before taking a sip from it. "It's okay, I'm happy to help. I know your deadline is getting closer."</p><p>Hokuto was right. Despite everything, Juri, Juri's engagement, his breakdown, the kiss, and the empty feeling in his chest, Taiga still had a deadline to meet.</p><p>He was already halfway through his 8 months and he barely had anything except a "concept" of what he wanted to do, which truly just meant that he really had nothing but stacks of books and a strong understanding of what he <em>didn't</em> want to write.</p><p>It didn't help that he wasn't exactly being productive either. Taiga would try to open up books and look through the drafts on his computer, but all he ever ended up doing was stare at the lines of words as his brain would think of nothing. Just nothing. Simple empty, until it slowly his body was swarmed with regrets and weighted by the pressure that only got heavier with each passing day.</p><p>The only escape he had was the eventual sleep that never made him feel rested as he woke up just as tired and strained as the day before.</p><p>Whether it was the aching heartbreak or the anxiety riddling loom of his approaching deadline, Taiga wasn't getting anything done.</p><p>Hokuto tried to help the best he could, going through books and marking the pages that had a character or a topic Taiga found interesting, but as Taiga flipped through the pages of colored tabs, it felt pointless.</p><p>It felt like a losing battle.</p><p>But Taiga still had to try.</p><p>And of course, Juri still came by.</p><p>Because, of course he did.</p><p>Because Juri wasn't the one who was broken that night. Taiga gave his all for Juri to simply have a long time friend who was excited for his future over dinner.</p><p>It was only Taiga who felt like he was drowning when they were together alone with water slowly rising from the floor beneath them.</p><p>At first, the water would fill Taiga's shoes as he tried to wade through their meeting, a discomfort settling into him from his socks becoming soaked from the rising tide until it reached his knees. Taiga would plaster on a smile as they talked, his body being weighed down by flood at his waist, making him unable to move and function with ease with it fighting and battling against him.</p><p>Soon enough, it would rise to his neck.</p><p>It strangled and swallowed him, Taiga choking on the water filling his lungs with his eyes stinging with tears as he sat and listened to Juri proudly tell him about his future.</p><p>It was unbearable.</p><p>The first day Juri came over, Taiga locked himself in the bathroom, faking a stomach ache until he could get the tears to stop.</p><p>The most Taiga could do was tell Juri he was busy or that his arrival would break the writing flow he didn't actually have. This at least, after Taiga turned him away from his door for a week, got Juri to start messaging him of his intended arrival, allowing Taiga to patch together excuses.</p><p>But Taiga was still supposed to be writing a manuscript.</p><p>And Juri was his editor.</p><p>It was their job and Taiga had no choice but to let Juri into his home. Even if Taiga wasn't getting anything done, he couldn't keep Juri from doing his.</p><p>So Taiga would let him in.</p><p>But only when Hokuto was there too.</p><p>With Hokuto, there was no water and there was no flood to strangle him.</p><p>It just became a room with Juri in it.</p><p>If Taiga was asked what it was about Hokuto that made it all different, he wouldn't be able to give an answer.</p><p>Hokuto just did.</p><p>And that was good enough.</p><p>Taiga didn't want to learn how to fight it when the water became too deep.</p><p>Taiga didn't want to learn to swim.</p><p>Right now, he just wanted to be saved.</p><p>Taiga gazed emptily at the bite he had cut from his toast before pushing it into mouth.</p><p>The flavor of the sweet breakfast was wonderful as expected.</p><p>The insides of the toast had melted into a soft texture as it held the flavors of cooked off liquor along with the sweetness from the added honey and sugar. Using a brioche would have added a richness and depth, but the thickly sliced shokupan held up to its own, serving well with its light yeast flavor and simple taste as it cut the sweetness.</p><p>The strawberries that were placed on top were also deliciously ripe.</p><p>The brief bliss of his breakfast allowed him to escape the throb in his chest for just a moment.</p><p>"I have to leave early today."</p><p>Taiga glanced over to see Hokuto folding his apron before returning back to his food, mindlessly running his fork through the golden syrup.</p><p>"... Is it for work?... Or something else?"</p><p>At this point, Taiga was well aware of Hokuto's "appointments" as more of his time was spent at his apartment.</p><p>Hokuto never explicitly said what they were, but Taiga could smell the extra spray of cologne that followed when Taiga closed the door behind him on his way out.</p><p>He wasn't an idiot.</p><p>Hokuto had been doing this far before he had ever met him and just because they had met wasn't going to change the type of person Hokuto was.</p><p>The other across from him responded promptly before taking his next bite.</p><p>"Work."</p><p>Taiga watched him chew for a moment before looking down at the strawberry he sank his fork into, the red juices drawing from its wound.</p><p>"I thought you didn't do lunch service on Mondays…"</p><p>"We're trying to increase our hours… It's just a special promotion for now, but if all goes well, we may keep the adjustment permanently," Hokuto sighed as he cut his knife into his food again.</p><p>"So I may not be able to be here as often or I have to leave early in the morning if I stay over."</p><p>Taiga finally put the brutalized fruit into his mouth.</p><p>"That's fine…"</p><p>"...... Are you guys struggling with money?"</p><p>Taiga didn't look up as Hokuto lightly laughed to himself.</p><p>"Salut? No, Salut is fine. We're just seeing how we can optimize our profits, even if it means working a little more during the week."</p><p>When Hokuto peered over, he saw Taiga still glowering over his plate although all he was doing was playing with the cuts of strawberry and stray slices of almonds alongside the main course.</p><p>His hand paused with his next bite as the kitchen went silent aside from the quiet tapping of Taiga's silverware against his plate.</p><p>"... Is something wrong?..."</p><p>Taiga stuck the prongs of his fork into an almond slice, cracking the soft flesh into pieces.</p><p>The silence dragged on as Hokuto waited, watching the almond under Taiga's wrath break into smaller and smaller pieces until Taiga finally spoke, mumbling against the sleeve he pressed to his mouth.</p><p>"... Can you go to work later?..."</p><p>"Like maybe until… around noonish?… Or maybe like… 12:15 exactly?..."</p><p>Hokuto took the bite on his fork that had been waiting just a bit too long.</p><p>"Is Juri coming?..."</p><p>The shattered pieces of the almond collected at the edge of Taiga's fork as he scraped it across his plate, not yet meeting Hokuto's gaze.</p><p>That was enough of an answer for Hokuto to interpret.</p><p>"... Just come with me."</p><p>Taiga's fork stopped its stabbing and scraping after Hokuto spoke, followed by Taiga finally raising his head.</p><p>"... Huh?"</p><p>Hokuto huffed out a restrained laugh, his lips forming a smile he covered with his mug of coffee.</p><p>"Come with me to Salut."</p><h6></h6><p>There was a wash of deja vu when Taiga stepped out of Hokuto's car in front of the restaurant.</p><p>When he had done this before, there was a line of girls at the front of the store that all were less than conspicuous when the stole giggling glances at him with the store sign set proudly before the alley, announcing it's availability for patronage.</p><p>Deep inside, Taiga was thankful it was quiet as he shut the door behind him, no line and no sign. Just a closed restaurant, not yet ready to accept its customers.</p><p>Juri had bought Taiga's excuse as he walked down the alley, his phone pinging with an "okay, I'll see you later then!" before Taiga stopped before the door.</p><p>The "Closed" sign turned against the glass intimidated Taiga for a second as he felt he was intruding on a business before opening, but Hokuto had told him to just knock on the door and someone would come.</p><p>Taiga sighed, raising his knuckles to tap on the frame twice.</p><p>It wasn't like he had a lot of options anyways.</p><p>It was either Salut or Juri and for the first time ever, Salut was the better option.</p><p>Taiga's mind was slowly clouding in his own thoughts as failed to notice the mix of shouting voices and the approaching heavy footsteps that came to the door before it burst open.</p><p>It was a little more energetic than Taiga had expected at this time in the morning, but at least he had learned his lesson from his first visit as he quickly stepped back, the door just nearly grazing his arm to present a familiar wide smile from behind it.</p><p>"Woah! Sorry, I almost got you there!" The man laughed brightly. "The door is just a little wide for the front step, you see, if people stand too close, it's very easy to accidentally get hit by it if you're not paying attention. You can't even imagine how many times I've almost hit someone with this door, you would think we would put some kind of warning, but <em>someone</em> told me a paper sign would make the entrance less attractive or something."</p><p>With the speed and energy the man used when he spoke, Taiga's sleep deprived brain was hardly able to keep up processing each word that rambled from the man's mouth as he presented the concrete pad beneath his feet. Even when he was given a breath's second of silence to respond, Taiga could only open his mouth before helplessly forfeiting to the man's wave of words.</p><p>"Um… I-"</p><p>"Well, aside from our establishment's wonderful design, I assume that you are here to dine with us and we here a Salut greatly appreciate your patronage." The man bowed politely, his gesture injected with his lighthearted boyish charm.</p><p>"No- I–"</p><p>"But! I'm sorry to tell you that we're actually closed at this time!" He spoke loudly with his chest puffed as he checked his watch.</p><p>"We are opening today at an earlier time, but we aren't quite ready to serve yet so if you would please come in-… 1 hour and 38 minutes, we would be pleased to have you–"</p><p>Finally, Taiga's brain caught up with the one-sided conversation when he saw the man began to close the door.</p><p>"Huh? No! I–!"</p><p>"Thank you! We hope to see you soon!"</p><p>"W-Wait–!"</p><p>Before Taiga could begin to hesitate grabbing the outer handle of the door, the both of them froze as a voice boomed from inside.</p><p>"Shintaro!!!"</p><p>The man's head whipped around as he leaned backwards, trying to get a better view of the service window his name had blasted through.</p><p>"You know that's the guy Hokuto texted us about!!! Just let him in!!!"</p><p>It had been a while, but even when echoed at a distance through the restaurant, Taiga could recognize the voice as Jesse's while the person whose name must have been Shintaro laughed and opened the door wide once again.</p><p>"Hey, sorry about that! As you heard, my name is Morimoto Shintaro, but since we already feel so close, feel free to call me Shintaro. It's always nice to have a little bit of fun in the morning, right?"</p><p>The man beamed as Taiga gave a stiff laugh.</p><p>"Yeah… Of course."</p><p>Even without his exhaustion, this whole encounter would have sapped all the energy Taiga had in his body in one go, but Taiga could tell Shintaro wasn't ill intended.</p><p>It was just that his life battery was at a completely different level.</p><p>If Taiga could generously call himself a pack of double As, then Shintaro must have been running on a pack of 9-volts with an energy drink packed on top.</p><p>Shintaro chuckled lightly as he held out his hand, leading Taiga inside.</p><p>"We set up a table for you." Shintaro spoke over his shoulder, locking the door behind Taiga as he walked past him. "If you can see it, it's at the other side of the bar."</p><p>Sure enough, there was a small table only big enough to snugly fit two pushed against the wall within the raised area of the bar.</p><p>It was… a little out of place.</p><p>Taiga didn't need to have the interior of Salut to notice that. All the other tables were set and placed neatly below the steps while his table stood solitary at the side of the bar.</p><p>Shintaro peaked over to him as he made quick steps to catch up behind him, raising an eyebrow once seeing the crease between Taiga's.</p><p>"... Is there something wrong?"</p><p>"... No…"</p><p>"It's fine."</p><p>Shintaro looked over to the table, pondering it himself before the light clicked on in his brain.</p><p>"... Oh!"</p><p>"Are you worried about standing out?"</p><p>Bullseye.</p><p>But Taiga knew better than to be ungrateful for something that was set up just for him. Shintaro, Jesse and Hokuto very well could have just given him a seat at the bar or at one of the typical tables and called it a day.</p><p>It was just that Taiga knew this would draw unwanted attention.</p><p>"... Just a bit, but it'll be alright. Thank you."</p><p>He was an adult, after all. He had to act like one sometimes.</p><p>Shintaro smiled as he walked with Taiga to his seat. "As much as we would have liked to have you stay with us in the kitchen, Jesse had to remind us that it would be a health code violation."</p><p>"He just had to remind you."</p><p>Shintaro jolted in surprise, the chair he was pulling out for Taiga briefly squeaking against the floor as he looked over to Hokuto who corrected him as he came inside from the back door.</p><p>"Not us."</p><p>"You just didn't want to carry out the spare table."</p><p>"And can you blame me??" Shintaro huffed, stepping back now that the chair was ready to welcome a guest. "It's heavy!!!"</p><p>Taiga watched the two bicker, stepping past Shintaro as he let out a deep exaggerated sigh while Hokuto removed his jacket, quickly retorting his complaints.</p><p>This was a side of Hokuto he hadn't seen before.</p><p>When it was Salut or when they were alone, it was always smiles and niceties before and after their forgotten bet took place. Even when they were at the theme park with Jesse and Kochi, Hokuto had his charms turned on as he tried to make their date as much of a date as he could.</p><p>Honestly, Taiga thought that was the only side of him, at least Hokuto had certainly fooled him into believing so.</p><p>It wasn't like Hokuto had turned from an angel to a devil, but there was a demeanor Taiga had grown used to and seeing the professional but comfortable and casual conversation Hokuto had with his workmates surprised him more than he thought.</p><p>There were always new things to learn about someone, he guessed.</p><p>As Hokuto laughed, smiling as he opened the door to the kitchen, Taiga took his gaze away, moving his attention back to the contents of his bag.</p><p>"Oh, that Hokuto. Always being a stickler for the details," Shintaro scoffed, waving his hand at the door Hokuto disappeared behind before finally turning back to Taiga.</p><p>"But I'm sure you're well aware of that by now, right?"</p><p>While Taiga nodded yes with a smile, he didn't really believe in his response.</p><p>Hokuto was always confident but patient with him, letting him make mistakes and learn from them when they cooked together. When something didn't turn out exactly right, Hokuto would just laugh and assure him that it's about the experience and how full his satisfaction was over his stomach.</p><p>He was never brash with him the way he was with Shintaro.</p><p>"Well!" Shintaro exhaled with a grin. "I have to get in there and help, but don't be afraid to holler if you need anything. Hokuto told me you'd be bringing a laptop so I went ahead and set up an extension cord back there for you."</p><p>From the obscure way Shintaro motioned to the area between the table and the wall, Taiga could guess where he would find it.</p><p>"Once we open the doors, I'll be the one to call on since Hokuto will be busy with the guests. I'm more like a…" Shintaro crossed his arms as he thought. "... Like an assistant or like uhh… back up. Reinforcements. Squad B. Hokuto being squad A. I'm the team that parachutes in when things get dire. I drive in the tank to finish the battle. I get the radio call to come in as fresh blood, you could say."</p><p>That got Taiga to laugh.</p><p>Shintaro seemed pleased by the fact that it did as he chuckled with a crooked grin.</p><p>"I got it. Thank you, Shintaro."</p><p>Shintaro gave him a playful salute, shortly bowing after.</p><p>"Do you want me to get you anything to drink before I get my hands dirty? Coffee? Tea? Iced tea? Water? Warm water? Morning beer? Morning wine??" Shintaro rambled, purposefully not giving Taiga the room to respond.</p><p>"Uhh… Tea?" Taiga replied hesitantly as he placed his books on the table.</p><p>"Black? Green? Genmai? Barley? English breakfast? Assam? Lapsang? Earl gray? Rooibos? Chamom–"</p><p>"Do you even have all of those? Isn't this a bar?"</p><p>Taiga figured he could go on, but while it was entertaining, the volume of Shintaro's voice made something pinch in the back of his skull.</p><p>"No! We don't!" Shintaro laughed. "How about green?"</p><p>"Green sounds just fine."</p><p>Shintaro gave him one last grin and a pat on the shoulder, jostling Taiga's glasses down his nose before speeding off.</p><p>"Got it. Be back in a bit."</p><p>As soon as Shintaro left through the kitchen door, the contrast made it feel eerily silent with only the muffled chatter and the chiming of kitchenware through the service window as Taiga was reminded he was now in the restaurant alone.</p><p>Without a soul occupying it, the room seemed to grow longer and wider in the quiet, almost intimidating him with its space and solitude as Taiga gazed around it.</p><p>Yet, it made it feel peaceful.</p><p>The morning sun that reflected off the windows from the building across the street poured through the wide panes of glass of the restaurant's front, laying large swaying flats of bright light over the dining room. Without anyone to bother it, the light only played with the chairs and tables before it, being cut and curved by the window frames and warm shifting patterns across the wooden floor.</p><p>Taiga watched how the shapes waved and brightened, manipulated by the drifting clouds in the sky as he listened to the laughter he now knew belonged to Jesse and Shintaro before placing his headphones into his ears, bringing him back into silence.</p><p>There was a loneliness in the empty space, but a serenity knowing that on the other side of the music playing in his ears, there were the warm voices of three friends that were enough to fill all of Salut.</p><p>With his music as his soundtrack, Taiga took his bag to set out his laptop and notebook, remembering the power strip that was placed just for him. He bent down under the table to push the prongs into the charger to find Shintaro returned with a cup of tea in a royal blue cup alongside a mille-feuille when he raised his head back above it.</p><p>The song that was playing switched as he read the overemphasized words Shintaro mouthed to him as he pointed to the pastry.</p><p>From Jesse.</p><p>"Thank you," Taiga said deafly, receiving a nod and a smile from Shintaro as he set down a fork for him before returning behind the kitchen door.</p><p>The cup clinked gently against its saucer as Taiga brought it to his lips, debating his own stomach while he was cleansed by the gentle bitterness of his tea.</p><p>As delicious as it looked, he wasn't sure if he would be able to digest any more sugar. The toast had already been a rare sweet for his morning and Taiga wasn't sure if innards could handle doubling up on that break from his usual patterns.</p><p>He set the pastry aside in favor of his books as he began to read and skim, looking for something to guide his writing, but as his eyes were stolen again and again by the flawless marbling of chocolate and the even piping of cream, he gave in to his watering mouth.</p><p>The pastry was flakey and buttery and crackled when Taiga cut into it with his fork, squishing the cream layers out its sides. The buttery savory of the puffed pastry tasted blissful as it blended with the smooth and airy custard cream.</p><p>Taiga hummed with delight as he finished it just a little too quickly, scraping up the last remnants with his fork before setting it down on the empty plate to push away, sighing as he found himself distracted for long enough.</p><p>He had told Juri that he would be going out to find some new scenery to help him write despite its irony, but even if it was just an excuse to escape, he had better make use of his things he had hastily packed and lugged with him and make a showing of it.</p><p>Another sip of his tea to wash the sweetness down with a deep breath, and Taiga steeled himself to start his work.</p><p>Or whatever was the right word to describe exactly what he was doing.</p><p>His current scheme was to mark the parts he found interesting in his favored books and then notate what it was about them that made them captivating. So far, he had been able to make a pretty substantial dent in his own library of books, filling them with a nondescript color coding of tabs with Hokuto being a large part of its steady acceleration.</p><p>While the tabs and points of interest weren't his own, it was fascinating to see how different or similar the placement of their marks would be if Taiga had done it himself. It made the process a little more enticing but even still, it was all moving at a snail's pace in the second half.</p><p>The tabbing was the easy part with Hokuto's help, but the collecting and writing he has to do himself.</p><p>And frankly, he just wasn't in the mood to do it, but the softly sunlit Salut gave him just enough encouragement to open his laptop and at least try.</p><p>Taiga thumbed through the book he had stopped midway through before, the colored tabs flipping by to find where he left off and began to read.</p><p>Trying was at least better than nothing.</p><p>As Taiga tried to focus for the next hour or so, Shintaro stopped by every so often, apron smeared with flour, asking if he wanted more tea or anything to eat. Taiga knew that Shintaro was using him as a reason to slip away from his work, but even though it broke him away from his own as well, the quick momentary visits broke him free from the sinking despair and sleep that weighed down his eyes. He always came with a big smile as he would refill Taiga's cup and wave a silent goodbye after seeing Taiga's headphones still in his ears.</p><p>Jesse had also made time to stop by as well, just as cheerful and friendly as he had been before, but without the nerves of the date as he laughed loudly and grinned when Shintaro not so purposefully but purposefully clashed his shoulder into his back on his way to prepare the main room. He asked Taiga about the mille-feuille and the roasted tomato recipe Hokuto had passed onto him before to which both Taiga said were delicious, drawing an embarrassed chuckle and smile from him.</p><p>"Have you still been in contact with Kochi?"</p><p>Jesse's ears instantly burned red as his fingers tugged at the sleeve of his work uniform.</p><p>"Yes, but… um…"</p><p>"He hasn't been replying lately…"</p><p>Taiga's brow raised before looking at the calendar on his computer.</p><p>That wasn't like Kochi to not reply.</p><p>Especially to someone he had forced his friend to go on a double date with.</p><p>"Oh. I see," Taiga said as he sat back in his chair. "It's his crunch period. He'll be back in a week or so. Were you worried that he was mad at you or something?"</p><p>The way Jesse sighed as he covered his mouth with his hand made him sound relieved, but the way his neck turned pink looked like he was only more nervous.</p><p>Which one was it?...</p><p>"No… Not mad, I just–… Well. I shouldn't bother you anymore and I should get back to the oven. Thank you, Kyomoto."</p><p>Taiga blinked as Jesse bowed to him. "Oh– uh. Yeah. No worries."</p><p>As the door swung closed behind Jesse, Taiga exhaled a breath through his nose, returning to his book and only thinking for a second that there was a third person he had yet to see come through the door to speak to him.</p><p>Other than that, Taiga's work was surprisingly calm as he flipped through the tabs, reading paragraph by paragraph to write down in words what about it captivated him.</p><p>After a while, Shintaro tapped his shoulder to let him know that the doors would be opening to which Taiga replied with a nod and placed his headphone back into his ear.</p><p>Thankfully, there wasn't much of a difference between the space being filled and the place being empty with his music as Taiga found his rhythm. Being in a separated area away from the main seating area minimized his distractions as the muted muffle of varying chatter only broke through when the song changed on his phone. At most, he saw the people who sat at the bar, but the rest were behind him and out of sight.</p><p>But on occasion as his neck grew stiff, Taiga looked up to see how the others were doing.</p><p>Jesse stayed in the kitchen, only appearing every so often in the service window as he set out the finished orders. Shintaro sped by frequently, quickly bussing and cleaning tables before checking out tabs at the bar as his attention was requested by a customer from time to time.</p><p>Everything else was handled by the man who had yet to speak to him since Taiga left his car.</p><p>Hokuto sat and served the guests, tending to their needs as much as he was physically available from the moment he greeted them at the door to when he handed them their jacket as they left. He worked tirelessly to make each custom feel welcome and warm in the restaurant, wearing a smile on his lips.</p><p>By far, Hokuto was the one he saw the most when Taiga raised his head to stretch his tightening shoulders and back.</p><p>Whenever he did, Taiga saw him doing exactly as he had expected.</p><p>A hand on their shoulder or an arm around the back of their chair. A low quiet voice meant for two or a secret brushing of fingers. Those subtle touches of intimacy that had disgusted Taiga before and now still made his insides curl.</p><p>Phrasing it simply, Hokuto was busy.</p><p>This wasn't like when they were at his apartment, cooking or watching TV together.</p><p>When Hokuto only had to give attention to him.</p><p>The page in Taiga's hand paused, left mid-turn as Taiga rested his chin in his palm, not realizing he was watching Hokuto a bit longer than he intended.</p><p>With the women in the restaurant, Hokuto attended to them so closely, it was like he wasn't even there, but Taiga understood. It was a job and it was a job that Hokuto clearly cared about deeply.</p><p>Right now, Taiga was nothing more than a second thought.</p><p>He watched as Hokuto kneeled down beside a woman, tilting his head to meet her eye with a smile. He nodded to her, talking briefly about dishes with his hand on her arm before getting back to his feet with the menu with the same warm expression.</p><p>Taiga had seen this before as he ran his thumbnail along the side of the page, catching on the light blue tab that stuck off the edge. It was nothing more than usual.</p><p>Then he blinked.</p><p>Hm?...</p><p>For a second, he could have sworn their eyes had locked when Hokuto glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>It had been so quick, Taiga would have almost thought it didn't happen, but from the way Hokuto seemed to fidget with the menus in his hand before returning them with the others, Taiga believed he wasn't mistaken.</p><p>It felt like Hokuto had done something he wasn't supposed to.</p><p>Was there something wrong with just a glance?...</p><p>A warm tingle crawled up the back of his neck and Taiga returned to his book.</p><p>It didn't matter.</p><h6></h6><p>
  <em>Would you like to have lunch?</em>
</p><p>Taiga's fingers stopped typing when the note scribbled on an order sheet was placed between his hands.</p><p>As he had expected, Shintaro was the one smiling back at him when he looked up from his screen.</p><p>After all, the handwriting was much messier than Hokuto's.</p><p>"What do you guys have?" Taiga asked, removing his headphones and wrapping the wire around his hand to stuff in his pocket.</p><p>"Well, you're free to look at the menu, but we'll have to charge you," Shintaro laughed.</p><p>"Or! You can have whatever I can scrape together in the back."</p><p>Taiga gave him a questioning glance before he double saved his document.</p><p>"Is that what you usually eat?"</p><p>"Yep!" Shintaro said proudly as he leaned into the table. "I will bring lunch pretty often, but eating whatever Jesse lets me have is not bad either. It's usually just food that's been sitting around for too long to serve but still good enough to eat."</p><p>"Oh, also if you accept the latter, the rule is that you have to eat with me."</p><p>While it was vague and potentially dubious, Taiga couldn't help but be curious about what that mystery could entail. Some company while eating didn’t sound all half bad either.</p><p>"Sure. I'll take whatever you have."</p><p>Shintaro grinned as he set himself back on his feet.</p><p>"Excellent. Give me 20 minutes and I'll have our meal."</p><p>When Shintaro said that it would take him 20 minutes, Taiga didn’t really think that he would arrive exactly 20 minutes later on the dot with two plates in hand.</p><p>Taiga had cleared off the table, setting his books neatly on top of his laptop on the side to allow Shintaro to slide the saucers onto the table, messily dropping forks beside them for both of them.</p><p>"I hope the presentation doesn't bother you. I'm not really one for looks when it's just a meal for myself." Shintaro let out a tired sigh, settling into the seat across from Taiga. "I did at least wipe the sauce off the rims for you though, so you have to at least give me some credit there."</p><p>As Shintaro had said, the presentation of the plate in front of Taiga wasn't exactly picture perfect. The noodles were messily poured into the saucer with no particular order, slathered in the white sauce that coated it and aside from the flat rim on the plate, there was no particular care on how it was served.</p><p>If it had been 5 months ago, Taiga wouldn’t have spared a second to notice how the noodles were thoroughly mixed with the sauce instead of placed over the top, making him believe that Shintaro had poured both into a pot to heat together rather than taking the time to heat the sauce separately. Either way worked, it was just that one looked a little better than the other. The dishes that Hokuto served him at home were always plated as nicely and picturesque as they would be inside of Salut, but Taiga didn’t complain about Shintaro’s work. Aesthetics didn’t change the flavor and it was a lunch Shintaro had made for him for free. It would have been selfish to ask for anything more.</p><p>"Thanks. It looks good," Taiga smiled with Shintaro mirroring it with his own, his cheeks puffed full of his food.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"It's-…" Shintaro took a second to swallow. "It's bechamel with linguine. We had croque monsieurs last week but we ran out of cheese. You'd be surprised by how hard it is to find the right type of cheese in this country."</p><p>"Oh! We have some rolls, let me get those!"</p><p>As Shintaro scurried out of his chair and through the kitchen door, Taiga twirled the pasta into his fork, watching how they glided smoothly in the tangled mess that was his lunch.</p><p>The taste was better than its appearance.</p><p>Taiga had tasted bechamel before, but not with pasta. While it had been with bread before, the linguine was not a bad replacement as it was comparable as a carb based foundation to the dish. It wasn't exactly balanced and the creamy sauce was easy to become overwhelming, but Shintaro had portioned it well with the roughly cut rings of green onion he had scattered on the top.</p><p>Shintaro returned, placing the bowl that was much too small for the rolls within it between them.</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>"... It's good," Taiga said as he took another bite.</p><p>Shintaro chuckled as he took a roll, breaking it in half.</p><p>"You don't have to be nice, but I appreciate it anyways."</p><p>The both of them ate quietly for a moment before Taiga spoke up, feeling the need to fill the dead air.</p><p>"Um, so this is your lunch break?"</p><p>"Mhm." Shintaro nodded as he wiped his mouth with his napkin. "I get 30 minutes to eat, not including any prep time I need to cook since I usually work as I wait for things to heat up and whatever.</p><p>"What about Matsumura?"</p><p>Shintaro dragged the last bit of his roll through his sauce. "Ahh, he just eats while he works. He did it like this before I was added to the staff so he said he's used to it. That guy eats like a bird during lunch anyhow."</p><p>He waved his hand at the kitchen door as he pushed the bread into his mouth. "He eats like two bananas back there, taking bites when he gets a chance or like a bowl of rice with just shichimi on it."</p><p>"I wish I could tell you how surprised I was when I saw that half empty bottle of shichimi when I started working here. For a second I thought Jesse was adding it to his food, claiming it to be French before I found out it was Hokuto's personal stash."</p><p>Taiga had wondered why he saw shichimi on his counter at home.</p><p>He never questioned it as other seasonings and dressings were starting to fill his cabinet as well, but Hokuto never used it in the food they shared.</p><p>The spice was just for him.</p><p>"By the way, I don't think I caught your name. Hokuto had just referred to you as 'a friend' in his message. Are you studying or something?"</p><p>"Oh. Sorry," Taiga said as he took the roll from the bowl.</p><p>"My name is Kyomoto Taiga."</p><p>Shintaro nodded and hummed as he lowered his head to eat another fork full of noodles, but the food never made it into his mouth as he froze.</p><p>"... Wait... Kyomoto Taiga?" His fork lowered back into his plate.</p><p>"WAIT. <em>THAT</em> KYOMOTO??"</p><p>Taiga pressed his finger to his lips, quickly hushing Shintaro as Shintaro whipped his head around, bowing his head in apology to the people who suddenly shot looks at them from his sudden outburst.</p><p>Taiga knew that his name was known in some circles, but it was far from being a household name unless someone just happened to be a fan. If anything, the title of his book was better known than the author attached to it.</p><p>But that didn't mean he wanted Shintaro to be shouting it in a small establishment.</p><p>"No wonder you have all these books with you!" Shintaro said in a loud whisper, pulling his chair back under him as he sat down, leaning into the table between them. "I haven't read any of them, but my mom is a huge fan of your series. My siblings and I bought her the set for Christmas a while back!"</p><p>"Ahh well thank you," Taiga laughed awkwardly, winding his fork into his food again. "I'm glad she enjoys my work."</p><p>"She's been really hoping that you'd write a spin off based on the partner in the third book"</p><p>"Tamamori? He passed in the fourth… I'm not sure how much more I could write on his story…"</p><p>Shintaro laughed. "Well, she can dream."</p><p>He sighed, dragging his hands back through his hair as he leaned back into his chair, eyes still wide with shock. "I can't believe Hokuto made friends with <em>the</em> Kyomoto Taiga. It was at that company party we hosted a while ago, wasn't it?"</p><p>Truthfully, it was a bit earlier than that… but to keep things simple, Taiga just said yes. Thinking back on that day still made Taiga cringe on the inside. Regardless of how much time had passed, it was still horrible from start to finish.</p><p>Hokuto had changed a lot since then. Or the way he acted had changed at least… or maybe just the way he acted around him had changed. He didn’t really make the advances the way he did their first few encounters, there was no teasing or flirtatious attempted touches and approaches. It really had just turned into something much more similar to two friends spending time with each other.</p><p>Or something like that… as long as you ignored the fact that he had cried in his arms and asked to kiss him as a favor for his own personal reasons.</p><p>"On the topic of Hokuto, there was something I wanted to ask." Shintaro dropped his hands into his lap.</p><p>Taiga broke his roll to dip a small portion into the bechamel. "I mean… You probably know more than I do, but go ahead."</p><p>"Do you think that Hokuto has been going out with less girls lately?"</p><p>Taiga paused as it took a moment for the question to completely process in his brain.</p><p>As far as he could tell, Hokuto still had days when he told him he was busy and walked away to take calls from girls while in the middle of cooking. His phone didn’t seem to vibrate with messages any less either. It didn’t appear any different.</p><p>"No… Do you?"</p><p>Shintaro crossed his arms as his brows furrowed in thought. "I used to see girls waiting outside for him all the time after work… Lately he's been going straight home more often." He waved his hand. "Don't get me wrong, he can do whatever he likes. It's great for business, I can tell, but…"</p><p>"I'm just curious what's going on with him."</p><p>Taiga was curious too.</p><p>Hokuto couldn't have been giving up that much of his schedule just to come over… Right?...</p><p>"... Well, he-"</p><p>Shintaro spun around in his seat when the kitchen door swung open.</p><p>Jesse was leaning through the door, pointing at the watch he wasn't wearing, prompting Shintaro to look down at his real one.</p><p>"Shit! I'm over time!" He scrambled picking up his empty water cup under his arm with his plate and fork in his hands, scarfing down what was left as he inched toward the door.</p><p>"Let me get your number later, okay!?" He shouted with his mouth full, toeing the door open. "I want to get your signature!"</p><p>Taiga waved, Shintaro responding with another puffy cheeked smile before the door swung shut behind him, leaving Taiga to finish the rest of his food alone.</p><p>He looked down at his mostly finished dish before peaking over into the main dining area again, spotting Hokuto's back.</p><p>Hokuto was serving a woman by the window, smiling as he set her order down and lightly setting his hand on her opposite shoulder. Taiga couldn't hear, but he knew Hokuto was explaining the dish as he leaned down towards her, his hand smoothing down to the center of her back as he finished, bowing politely before moving away.</p><p>Hokuto was the same.</p><p>But he was different.</p><p>Taiga wasn't really sure how to explain it.</p><p>He stuck his fork into his food, twirling the messy noodles together, choosing to think about it later as he cleaned his plate with his bread.</p><p>Shintaro came back after bussing a few tables to take Taiga's empty dish and to get his number. He quickly wiped down the table they shared as he was called by Jesse again, speeding away with a grin on his face and a promise that he'll be back.</p><p>With Shintaro gone and his table clean, Taiga had nothing else to do but to go back to his work.</p><p>He undid his neatly organized stack, taking each and opening them to where he shoved a napkin in to keep his place as his other hand blindly took the next. All were set out as he had them before but as he reached out for the last, the one he had currently as his focus, it was gone from its spot.</p><p>The first thing that Taiga noticed when he looked across from him were her nails.</p><p>They were as long and as lacquered as they were when Taiga saw them trail along Hokuto's arm and bury into his hair, but a deep emerald green instead of the ruby red they had been then.</p><p>"How interesting… I never thought that the heroine would be willing to leave her whole family like that, especially after she committed her whole journey just for them."</p><p>Her voice was smooth and sweet, but there was a certain bitterness underneath that Taiga couldn't ignore. But some people were just like this, even when their intentions weren't malicious.</p><p>It fit someone who would invite themself to a stranger's table.</p><p>"... Have you read it before?"</p><p>Taiga tried to hide the hesitancy in his voice, but he couldn't help but feel defensive, especially when her lips curled up as she turned the page.</p><p>"I have. It won awards a few years ago, right? All my friends were reading it." She held out the book, her nails dragging gently on the hard cover as Taiga took it from her hand.</p><p>"It did…"</p><p>Taiga could feel her eyes on him as he flipped through the pages to find his spot.</p><p>He had really hoped that would be the end of their conversation, finishing it with a silence to encourage her departure, but when he set down his book, she ran her fingers over his knuckles, making the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.</p><p>"You have very nice hands…" she smiled as she took Taiga's hand into hers, unfolding his fingers to brush hers along them. "Your fingers are so long and pretty…"</p><p>Taiga tried to force words from his mouth or even find a reason to take his stolen hand back to himself, but as the ends of her nails dragged gently over the inside of his hand, his speech got stuck in his throat as it sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>"U-um-"</p><p>"It makes me wonder what you can do with them."</p><p>Taiga snatched his hand back. His palm stung from the scratch that had dragged down it as he pulled his hand back, holding it against his chest that was barely containing his racing heart.</p><p>This whole situation went from uncomfortable to horrible in one fell swoop.</p><p>He found himself glancing around, looking for anyone who could save from the web that he felt was slowly encircling him as the woman giggled, placing her cheek in her palm as she watched Taiga fix his glasses and try to refocus on his book.</p><p>Hokuto was busy and Jesse and Shintaro were nowhere to be found.</p><p>He was on his own.</p><p>"You're cute."</p><p>"...... Thanks…"</p><p>She chuckled again.</p><p>"You're very welcome."</p><p>Taiga opened up his laptop, hoping to put up something like a wall between them, but any security that it brought was shattered as she ran her long colored nail across the top.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?..."</p><p>He had hoped that not responding would end the conversation, but to his dismay, she continued on.</p><p>"What is someone like you doing here?"</p><p>… How was Taiga supposed to answer that?…</p><p>He really didn’t want to tell her that he was doing anything more than what a normal customer would be doing at Salut despite the fact that he had a table set up just for him. He especially didn’t want to tell her it was because the three were nice enough to give him a place to escape his heartache.</p><p>"... What do you-"</p><p>She cut him off as soon as he started to speak.</p><p>Even with the way she layed on the playful tune thick, Taiga could still hear the condescending sting concealed underneath as she spoke.</p><p>"You can see this place is filled with girls... You seem like a smart boy. You know what they're here for, right?" She tapped her cheek with her finger as her lips formed a sweet smile.</p><p>Taiga’s fingers curled into the keys of his laptop. "Huh? What does th-"</p><p>"Are you here in hopes of picking one of them up? Maybe you think that some of them will pay attention to you and you can take one of them home?" She asked with an innocent inquiring look, sending shocks of panic and embarrassment through Taiga’s body as he began to protest.</p><p>"No! I just–!"</p><p>"Or are you hoping to get <em>his</em> attention too?"</p><p>Her last question rang in his ears as if it was amplified through a speaker, his mind going blank.</p><p>Taiga was speechless.</p><p>He hated how his silence made it seem as if it was true.</p><p>She laughed lightly, her smile becoming sly as she pushed down the screen of Taiga's laptop, leaning towards him.</p><p>Taiga couldn't bring himself to pull away as she grew close and placed her hand over his, the drape in her top revealing more of the tease of cleavage than before.</p><p>"Listen."</p><p>Her voice pounded in his ears, even when it was only nearly a whisper.</p><p>"He treats everyone the same."</p><p>"There's a pattern, you see. Look."</p><p>Like a spell, Taiga turned his head to look at Hokuto across the room.</p><p>It was like he was watching a movie that was being directed by her and Hokuto was her actor.</p><p>"He'll ask her name first. And once he says her name back to her, he'll get closer, using the menu as his reason."</p><p>He saw Hokuto's lips form words, handing the woman the menu as shrunk the distance from him and her side.</p><p>"Then he'll make a suggestion."</p><p>Hokuto's hand reached out to point at the menu.</p><p>"He'll ask if she has a question, which they always do."</p><p>He smiled with a nod.</p><p>"He'll kneel down to meet her level and put his hand on the back of her chair."</p><p>"If he can, he'll touch her hand."</p><p>"When he gets up, he'll touch her back. It's a bonus if he can also brush by her hair."</p><p>Step by step, Hokuto did exactly as she said. All Taiga could do was stare as he followed her script, one by one. Perfect to her description. In a way, he already knew all the moves and tricks he used, but from the way that Hokuto followed her line by line, he might as well have been a puppet in her hand.</p><p>His head snapped back to her when she tapped a nail under his chin, slipping his glasses back up his nose once their eyes locked again.</p><p>She was very pretty. Her light colored hair styled and curled into place with just a touch of color on her eyes, making them look bright with her painted lips.</p><p>But her words defied her appearance.</p><p> </p><p>"So don't come in here thinking you're so special."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes widened.</p><p>"... Wh-"</p><p>"Hinako!"</p><p>Hokuto's voice shattered the trance like state Taiga was locked in as his eyes broke away from hers, air finally reaching his lungs as the woman sat back in her chair.</p><p>Taiga could only stare down at his book, clenching his shaking hands as she smiled up at Hokuto who quickly approached the table.</p><p>"Hokkun! I was just-"</p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p>Taiga wasn’t able to notice the stern tone in Hokuto’s voice as he tried to pull himself together and slow his racing pulse.</p><p>"This is your friend, right? I just wanted to get to know him, just like Jesse and Shin-chan."</p><p>Her voice had returned to the sweet voice she had when she arrived, the sharp words gone from her tongue.</p><p>"Yes, but-..." Hokuto glanced over to Taiga whose head was still lowered. "... Look, you can't be here."</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Taiga saw her grab Hokuto’s hand as he pushed back open his laptop, trying to ground himself back in his work. Her fingers thread between his while her other hand held onto his wrist, tugging at his arm.</p><p>"Why not?... We were having so much fun…" she pouted.</p><p>"You're not mad at me are you?"</p><p>"No… Never."</p><p>"Hokkun."</p><p>The wire of his headphones became tangled as Taiga tried to pull the bundle apart. He had managed to steady his hands enough to jam the jack into his phone but was far from deafening himself with his music as she smiled up at him.</p><p>He only managed to get one side placed in his ear before she spoke.</p><p>"Kiss me?..."</p><p>Hokuto smiled, unable to keep his eyes from darting over to Taiga before returning to her as he cupped her cheek, his voice soft.  "Not inside… I told you."</p><p>"Then later?"</p><p>"Later… Come on. I'll take you back to your seat."</p><p>He held out his hand, helping her to her feet before taking her back to her place at the bar, their hands still locked together.</p><p>Finally, as his music began to play, Taiga felt like he could breathe.</p><p>He took in a deep breath, scratching the back of his neck and hair as he tried to calm himself and focus back on anything, anything at all as his eyes ran over the same sentence on his screen, over and over, not taking in any of the words.</p><p>Even with rock blasting in his ears, he could only hear the woman’s voice play in repeat.</p><p>
  <em>He treats everyone the same.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don't come in here thinking you're so special.</em>
</p><p>The same.</p><p>You're not special.</p><p>The voice that was hers became his own.</p><p>You're just like the rest.</p><p> </p><p>There is nothing special about you.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey. Are you alright?"</p><p>Taiga blinked and raised his head, finding Hokuto squatting down beside him with a concerned look on his face.</p><p>Hokuto’s hand was placed close to his own on the table, but not nearly enough to be touching.</p><p>"U-um…" Taiga's voice cracked as he forced it past his throat.</p><p>"Y-yeah…"</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p>Hokuto's worried expression softened as he sighed.</p><p>"I'm sorry about her… If she said anything weird, just ignore it. She's just a little…"</p><p>"... Different?"</p><p>Hokuto forced a bit of a smile as Taiga’s jaw clenched.</p><p>"I guess you could say that…"</p><p>Taiga saw Hokuto's hand rise from his knee as if to reach out, but it fell before it even started, smoothing down his lap.</p><p>"I have to get back to work…"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>He gave him another soft smile before getting back on his feet.</p><p>"Let Shintaro know if you need anything, okay?"</p><p>Taiga took his cup, hoping the cold water could wash away his shaken nerves.</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Also um…"</p><p>"I won't be coming over tonight…"</p><p>Taiga touched the lip of his glass to his lip.</p><p>"... Okay."</p><p>And with that, Hokuto left, ending the first and only exchange of words between them since Taiga had sat down in his seat.</p><p>Taiga was still, the cup still at his lips as the voices slowly returned, growing in volume.</p><p>He threw back his cup, draining the rest of its contents down his throat, the words playing in his head again.</p><p>
  <em>Hokuto doesn't find anything special about you.</em>
</p><h6></h6><p>Taiga went home early, knowing that he wouldn't be making any more progress in Salut.</p><p>Hokuto got Shintaro to drive him home as the restaurant slowly eased into its off hours, becoming easily managed alone.</p><p>On the drive home, Shintaro chatted with him cheerfully which Taiga greatly appreciated as it helped him feel a normalcy after the shock that was sent through his system. Before they arrived at the front of his building, Taiga jotted down his signature on a free page of his notebook, tearing it out and handing it to Shintaro with a promise of a more proper and quality one in the future before waving as he drove off.</p><p>The first thing Taiga did when he shut his door behind him was immediately fall asleep.</p><p>He dropped his bag on his ottoman before falling down onto his couch and curling one of his blankets around him.</p><p>Taiga was exhausted.</p><p>Both mentally and physically.</p><p>But he mostly just wanted to shut his mind off again.</p><p>He wanted the words to stop, just for long enough so he could forget them.</p><p>He slept, his brain quiet in his slumber as the remaining daylight burned away without a second thought. He tossed and turned in the narrow space of the couch until a warm lingering feeling touched his cheek made him stir.</p><p>Through his blurred vision, he knew it could only be one person just the same as the morning.</p><p>"... Matsumura?"</p><p>The owner of the name smiled, his hand drawing back to himself.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Taiga rubbed his eyes with his palms, pushing up his glasses he had forgotten to remove.</p><p>"I thought you couldn't come over tonight…"</p><p>"I did… but I found some time."</p><p>Though it was unfocused and hazed, Taiga could see the shapes and colors well enough to see Hokuto was still dressed in his work outfit, but just with one or two buttons undone more than usual.</p><p>He could have sworn he also saw a dark splotch on his collar before Hokuto fixed his shirt.</p><p>"... What time is it?"</p><p>"About 11 pm."</p><p>Taiga swallowed to wet his throat before throwing his arm over his eyes, trying to adjust to fall asleep again.</p><p>"... Do you want to go to bed?..."</p><p>"... Why can't I sleep here?" Taiga mumbled.</p><p>"Because if I stay over, this is where I sleep. Unless you're willing to give me your bed."</p><p>Taiga groaned, clutching his blanket.</p><p>"... Do you want me to carry you to bed?"</p><p>Taiga didn't respond.</p><p>Mostly because he wasn't sure what he wanted.</p><p>It was embarrassing to have another man carry him to bed like a child and their mother. It was emasculating and made him feel weaker than he already felt he was. By all reasonable means, Taiga should have said no.</p><p>But the next thing he knew, a warmth had wrapped under him, lifting him and bringing him to his room.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as his head rested in the crook of Hokuto’s neck.</p><p>Taiga had only felt a warmth like this once before, when Juri and him had jammed themselves onto a small narrow bed after both of them refused to take the old futon on the ground. They slept, backs facing each other, but Taiga had woken up when Juri threw his arm over him in his sleep, resting limply at his waist.</p><p>He knew he should have pushed Juri's arm off of him or woke him up, but the warmth on his back was comfortable and drew him back to sleep.</p><p>That same comforting heat was against his side and against his cheek.</p><p>But this one was warmer.</p><p>It was different.</p><p>Different.</p><p>Special.</p><p>Something.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>No one.</p><p>Everyone.</p><p>The same.</p><p>Taiga was just like the others, because of course he was. He had to be.</p><p>Because if he wasn't, then what was he?</p><p>There couldn't be anything else.</p><p>The way Shintaro had prepared their lunch was messy and mindless, throwing in what was needed but not sparing for what wasn’t required. He was kind and shared his food with a person he had just met the same day.</p><p>Hokuto always presented their meals nicely, taking the time and care to line up the slices of pain perdu with the even cuts of strawberries placed delicately on top.</p><p>It was nothing special.</p><p>It had to be.</p><p>Just as Hokuto smiled and showed kindness to all the women who came into his restaurant. He kissed them and held them as they asked. He held them in their sleep. He kept them warm in the cold. He cooked for them and gave them their plate with that smile that Taiga by now had picture perfect in his mind’s eye.</p><p>It was the same.</p><p>Everyone was the same.</p><p>Including him.</p><p>Why would he have ever believed anything different?</p><p>Taiga’s eyes fluttered open, finding himself tucked neatly into his bed and dressed in his pajamas he knew he wasn’t wearing before.</p><p>He first looked at the clock.</p><p>2 am.</p><p>Then he looked at his door.</p><p>There was a light still on and a quiet voice behind it.</p><p>Taiga quietly slipped out from his bed and took his glasses from his bedside stand, still half asleep as he stepped silently over to the door, gently pressing his ear against it, Hokuto's voice coming through.</p><p>"... Of course………. Why would you think any differently?..............."</p><p>A gentle laugh.</p><p>".......No, you're very beautiful………… Mhm………. Yes, I really think so."</p><p>Taiga’s fingers curled gently around his handle to unlatch the door.</p><p>The warm light from his living room lamp poured through the crack, Taiga squinting as it momentarily blinded him as the door came open, but once his eyes adjusted and focused as much as they could in the veil of his awakening, he saw the hazy shape of Hokuto sitting on his couch with his phone pressed to his ear and a book in his lap.</p><p>Marking and tabbing.</p><p>Still.</p><p>Even this late at night after working a full shift at work, rolling his sore neck and combing back his hair with his fingers.</p><p>Taiga pushed the door open slowly as Hokuto's conversation continued.</p><p>"... Going to sleep already?.......... Ending a call with you is always too soon………. I'll miss you too… Goodnight."</p><p>A touch. A smile. These candy sweet words. Isn't that what Hokuto gave to all the girls that asked for his attention?</p><p>Then what was this?</p><p>What was this tireless work he did for him even after he had told him not to?</p><p>What was the shocked but worried look that Hokuto gave him when he saw him standing there, still awake?</p><p>What were these incomplete touches that Hokuto started but never finished as he came over to him after he had said his name?</p><p>What were these soft words that felt so close even when they were completely opposite of ones he was saying into the phone before?</p><p>Was Hokuto different or was he just different around him?</p><p>Was Taiga the same as the rest or was he something special?</p><p>Hokuto's hand returned to his side before it had nearly placed itself on Taiga's arm.</p><p>"What's wrong?... Can you not sleep?..."</p><p>Taiga could only stare down at Hokuto's chest.</p><p>Hokuto had always faked and played with the image of love and affection with words and intimate touch. He would tell girls how pretty there were and how lovely they were with his sweet words. He held their hands and put himself around them, making them feel his embrace whether it be was innocent or heated and hot. This physical touch and carefully crafted words were the method of his attraction with all the women that asked and requested his attention whether at the restaurant or on a date where they played lovers for only the evening.</p><p>Taiga had asked Hokuto to show him what love was and in all honesty, he thought Hokuto had given up and forgotten after the kiss.</p><p>But maybe Taiga was just looking at it the wrong way.</p><p>Maybe love was much more than words and a kiss.</p><p>Hokuto searched for Taiga's eyes when Taiga had put his hand on his chest, gripping into his shirt.</p><p>"Kyomoto?... Wh-"</p><p>Taiga's voice was soft as words spilled out that he couldn't take back.</p><p>"Will you share my bed with me?..."</p><p>Taiga could feel the throbbing of Hokuto's heart under his hand, especially after Hokuto placed his own hand over his.</p><p>"... Are you sure?..."</p><p>Taiga nodded before pulling Hokuto by his shirt into his room.</p><p>Hokuto kept his hand wrapped around the fist that pulled him.</p><p>Taiga slipped into bed first after giving Hokuto a pair of his own pajamas, watching him pull off his shirt and undo the buckle in his belt to shed himself of the clothes that were dirtied by the outside, Taiga seeing the marks left over his shoulders and collar before they were covered by the pajamas Hokuto slipped over his toned body.</p><p>When Hokuto got into his bed, before he could take a pillow to set a space between them, Taiga curled into his chest, making Hokuto unable to keep himself from pulling him into his arms and tucking his head under his chin.</p><p>Hokuto had intended to keep his hands to himself, knowing the way that Taiga normally drew away from his touch, but when it was Taiga who came to him, he couldn’t help himself from taking as much as he could until Taiga pushed him away again.</p><p>Taiga settled into Hokuto's heat, letting himself be folded into it as he lifted his head to allow Hokuto to place his arm under it.</p><p>He absentmindedly played with the button on Hokuto's shirt as he stared at the dark bruise on Hokuto's skin.</p><p>Maybe he was the same as all the others and maybe there were other girls Hokuto stayed up late for. There could be girls Hokuto gave his time to, who he seemed he feared to touch. Girls who he used that gentle concerned voice with.</p><p>……</p><p>Who cares.</p><p>Hokuto could do what he wanted.</p><p>Hokuto could give everything Taiga thought was special to him to someone else.</p><p>As long as Taiga could have now.</p><p>"... Matsumura…"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"... Can you kiss me?"</p><p>Hokuto’s grip tighten on Taiga’s shoulder.</p><p>"........ Again?"</p><p>"Again."</p><p>They pulled away from their hold just enough to meet each other’s eyes, Taiga’s closing as Hokuto placed his hand on his cheek.</p><p>"... Can I ask why?..."</p><p>Hokuto knew what he wanted Taiga to say.</p><p>But he knew he was far from ever hearing those words from his lips.</p><p>"Practice… Training… Whatever."</p><p>"Just until it feels like something."</p><p>It wasn't the reason Hokuto wanted, but he would have been a fool to say no.</p><p>Hokuto kissed Taiga again, soft and gentle and though the magic of their first kiss had been long passed, Hokuto’s heart still raced.</p><p>A soft sigh left Taiga's lips with the kiss broke.</p><p>Taiga buried his head in Hokuto’s neck again, Hokuto threading his fingers through his hair and his arms tightened around him, holding him close.</p><p>Before Taiga’s eyes closed for sleep, they focused on the hint of red lipstick that Hokuto was unable to rub away, stained around the bruise on his collar.</p><p>He hid himself in the collar of Hokuto’s shirt with his hands loosely clutched into its back as he whispered.</p><p>“... Maybe next time.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"I have to get going."</p><p>Taiga had figured this was what Hokuto would say after he had gone quiet with his phone in his hand.</p><p>When Taiga glanced up at the clock, he saw it was just after 10 pm.</p><p>If the time passed 11, there was a sort of unsaid promise that Hokuto would be spending the night. Taiga had hoped that minute hand would have made its full round to the next hour, but Hokuto's phone called for his attention whenever it wanted. He had been more than selfish with Hokuto's time and he was in no place to ask for more.</p><p>"Oh. Okay."</p><p>He just had hoped Hokuto would share his bed with him again tonight.</p><p>Taiga paused the TV and followed Hokuto to the door. "Are you coming over tomorrow?"</p><p>Hokuto kept his eyes on his shoes as he slipped them onto his feet.</p><p>"I'll have to see."</p><p>That meant no. Taiga didn't have to look any further between the lines to know that. It was just Hokuto's polite way of saying it before it was confirmed by text from the next day.</p><p>"Alright… Just message me."</p><p>"I will."</p><p>Hokuto adjusted the bag on his shoulder one last time, a small smile warming on his lips though Taiga didn't meet his eyes.</p><p>"I'll see you soon."</p><p>"... Yeah."</p><p>The dead bolt thunked as Hokuto undid the lock before taking the handle, but before the door could unlatch, a hand grabbed at his arm, making Hokuto peer back over his shoulder to the gaze that still stayed trained on his back.</p><p>The gaze moved as Taiga's grip tightened only for a second before it barely tugged on his sleeve.</p><p>"Um… Before you go–..."</p><p>Hokuto knew well enough by now what this gaze meant without Taiga saying a word.</p><p>Whenever Taiga looked at his lips, he wanted a kiss.</p><p>Not because it was romantic.</p><p>Just because Taiga wanted to feel something.</p><p>Hokuto nodded and Taiga closed his eyes, his hold on Hokuto's shirt falling as he turned to him.</p><p>As much as Hokuto wanted to carefully hold his cheek and smile into his lips, he never did because that wasn't what this was for. There was no moment of shared endearment before Hokuto would be tempted to steal another from Taiga's lips.</p><p>All he ever did was lean in to have enough of a touch for it to be described as a kiss.</p><p>And everytime he pulled away, Taiga's eyes were the same as the first, wandering as he sought something inside him that he never found.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Just like before and surely the next that followed.</p><p>Hokuto turned back to the door.</p><p>"... Don't go to sleep too late."</p><p>Taiga nodded as Hokuto turned the handle.</p><p>"Matsumura."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Hokuto looked back to him after stepping through the doorway, his keys already in his hand.</p><p>"Have a safe trip."</p><p>It was just 4 words.</p><p>A lot could be said with just 4 words. And those 4 words meant a prayer of safety. A belonging to a home. An awaiting of return, even though Hokuto truly didn't know when he would be able to stand here at this door again.</p><p>Whether or not Taiga meant any of that, Hokuto smiled as his chest ached.</p><p>"I'm leaving now."</p><h6></h6><p>"Hey! Wooow, it looks so much cleaner in here!"</p><p>Taiga sighed sharply as he stepped back to let Juri inside.</p><p>"Like you're really one to talk."</p><p>"I'll never forget the state of your dorm room."</p><p>"That was a different time, okay? I'm a changed man. Also that was only once," Juri frowned, handing Taiga his briefcase to remove his shoes. "I had a very important tournament on my game that week and I didn't have time for my meticulous cleaning."</p><p>"Sure…"</p><p>Taiga shut the door before dropping Juri's bag by his preferred seat in the living area as Juri glanced around the room, smiling as he lowered his head to put his feet in the newly added guest slippers by the door.</p><p>"Really, it's nice to see the place picked up, though Kyomo. It makes me feel like I'm looking at where your mind is right now."</p><p>Taiga poured a mug of coffee he knew Juri would eventually ask for.</p><p>"I guess…"</p><p>Taiga had written something.</p><p><em>Something</em> was the key word here. It wasn't exactly full, but it was something. It was honestly a miracle in itself that he had been able to write anything at all, though it was nowhere close to being full. It was better described as a skeleton, but only if the skeleton had no shape, no form, and didn't actually really help show where things should be put to make it feel whole.</p><p>So, it was something.</p><p>But something was better than nothing.</p><p>"So!" Juri smiled, sitting in his place on the couch as he took the mug of coffee from Taiga.</p><p>"You want to show me what you got?"</p><p>"Yeah." Taiga quickly wiped his hands on a kitchen towel.</p><p>"Let me get it."</p><p>Juri made himself comfortable, taking off his suit jacket as Taiga scurried off to take his laptop and charger from his room. When he returned, Juri was all settled in, leaning back into the couch with his coffee in hand.</p><p>"No Hokuto today?"</p><p>Taiga paused midway through setting his laptop in front of Juri, glancing up at the other to see him sip from his mug.</p><p>He sighed as his body relaxed, placing the laptop down on the coffee table.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Not today."</p><p>Juri hummed as Taiga went to plug the charger in advance of its necessity.</p><p>It had already been around a month since Taiga had been able to be alone with Juri again.</p><p>The flooding waters had stopped filling the room and the suffocation in his chest shrank to a still painful but manageable squeeze at the mention of his fiancé or his expected child. He still didn't like thinking about that night or the embarrassment and shame that followed after, but Taiga could survive.</p><p>It was rather convenient timing as Hokuto's schedule had become steadily more occupied by either work or something else.</p><p>Taiga didn't know because he never asked.</p><p>"That's too bad! I was kind of hoping that he would make something for us!" Juri laughed, taking the laptop into his hands. "I didn't eat breakfast on purpose."</p><p>"I can make you something."</p><p>Juri blinked before looking over the back of the couch to see Taiga checking his fridge.</p><p>"....... Really?"</p><p>Taiga didn't bother to turn to him as he started to rummage through his kitchen drawers.</p><p>"Really."</p><p>Juri just chuckled as he returned his attention to the laptop with an exaggerated sigh. "Amazing how things change, huh? It feels like just yesterday I was helping you make your instant yakisoba."</p><p>"Does fried rice sound good?" Taiga said, ignoring Juri's mention of the shortcomings of his past.</p><p>"Isn't it a little early to have fried rice?"</p><p>"Consider it brunch and it counts."</p><p>Juri leaned over to unclip his briefcase with a smile.</p><p>"Then sure. Sounds great."</p><p>Taiga took out the scraps of his last meals as Juri placed a cigarette between his lips to start his reading. He didn't light it since Taiga didn't let anyone smoke inside unless it was under the kitchen vent full blast, but the editor insisted that simply the sensation helped him concentrate.</p><p>As Taiga cooked, the hums and mutterings he heard from Juri gave him no real indication on the quality of his writing as the sounds stayed neutral in their interest, but when he glanced over while removing rice from the cooker, it at least appeared that Juri was captivated with his fingers resting on his chin and his cigarette between his teeth.</p><p>While Juri's focus made no promises, Juri was bold enough to drop a manuscript midway if he found it wasn't worthwhile and his continued reading made Taiga feel that he has at least made a first step in the right direction.</p><p>After quickly dicing the assortment of leftovers and vegetables, the rest of the cooking went like a breeze as the oil sizzled loudly in the pan with the raw ingredients.</p><p>Taiga tossed it, waiting for the water to cook off before he blindly held out his hand for the bowl of whisked eggs that never came.</p><p>The pan continued to crackle as Taiga looked over to the empty space beside him, realizing his mistake.</p><p>For a moment, he hesitated, staring at nothing but a vacancy as the fire still blazed from the stove top. It was only until Juri's loud sigh pulled him back to earth, carrying Taiga finally to take the bowl himself to mute the hot steel with its contents along with the stirring of his mind.</p><p>Without another thought, Taiga finished and plated the rice on the plates with spoons before turning the fan on low and bringing them to the couch.</p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>Juri didn't look up to Taiga even as his lunch was set in front of him, leaving Taiga to sit and watch him pour over the laptop as he waited, slowly eating from the unruly mound of rice on his plate.</p><p>But soon enough, Juri replied.</p><p>"... It's interesting."</p><p>Juri sighed as he swapped the laptop and the cigarette in his mouth for his plate and its spoon.</p><p>"But it's messy."</p><p>Taiga dug his spoon into the small mountain.</p><p>"The concept of language is very interesting. It's just not very unique… I can tell you're just kind of writing things down. There's not really any order or reason."</p><p>"It might be enough to sell to the chief to get a smile, but it doesn't really have any life beyond that. This by itself isn't enough."</p><p>Taiga let a pea roll from his spoon before taking the bite. "I know…"</p><p>"Not every story has to be deep. Sometimes stories are good enough with having the 'hidden message' underneath," Juri said, throwing up a one handed air quote. "If the reader is having fun, then that's really all that matters. It doesn't have to have a deeper meaning. Sometimes stuff like that are just modes for writers to convince their readers that their words are heavier than they really are to make them feel smart. It's like movie awards. They love to give awards to the historical movies that have depth or whatever because it feels more avant-garde, but that doesn't mean the children's movie wasn't just as good."</p><p>"It's great when it works, but sometimes, all it is is an easy sell."</p><p>Juri pointed his spoon at him as he continued to eat. "I know I'm just repeating myself. You've heard me say this time and time again, but my point is that I want you to just relax and have fun with it."</p><p>"It's okay if it feels a little trivial at the start, but if you try to establish a deeper message before the story is written, you'll be beating the readers over the head with a bat while trying to tell them there's a reason for it. Just write a story that you enjoy writing."</p><p>"And this." Juri tapped the laptop before filling his spoon with food. "This isn't a bad start."</p><p>Taiga lowered his eyes back down to his plate as Juri took another bite.</p><p>Juri had always had this great ability of dragging a person down before boosting them back up. He gave crystal clear criticism that couldn't be begrudged because it was honest in nature, only making the complements that followed feel equally as earnest.</p><p>Taiga knew that he was far from what could be called a good story, but he couldn't help but feel a twinge of bitterness at the reality of Juri's words before he was encouraged that it was at least a good direction to take.</p><p>It was hard to tell if Taiga felt better or worse before Juri gave his feedback, but at least knowing that everything wasn't useless was enough for him to thank him.</p><p>"Thanks, Juri… I'll keep working on it."</p><p>"Oh. And your fried rice isn't half bad."</p><p>Taiga laughed as he gathered what was left of his lunch on the plate's side.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>"After we eat, back to work?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>While Taiga took his laptop to work at the kitchen table to save his back from a painful slouching on his couch, Juri stuck around, claiming the coffee table with manuscripts to work diligently away from the office.</p><p>Despite pushing the boundaries of his liberties a bit far, as often as Juri was peeking over Taiga's shoulder to look at his progress, he was reading quietly, skimming and thumbing through thick packets of paper while marking pages and jotting notes in the margins.</p><p>Taiga knew that Juri had the results to justify his independence, but after a few displeased mumblings and disappointed sighs, Taiga couldn't help but notice how Juri had abandoned his work to move his attention to sorting through the CDs on Taiga's shelf.</p><p>As much as Taiga wanted to judge Juri's neglect, he was also reaching his limit too.</p><p>He tried his best to focus on the words before him, whether a book or his own writing, but he couldn't escape the nagging deep down in his core that made him continuously check his silent phone.</p><p>Each time, he was met with an empty screen and an unchanging chat box before Taiga locked and darkened the screen to only repeat the process again minutes later.</p><p>He didn't know what he was waiting for.</p><p>Well, he did, but he just didn't know why he was waiting so impatiently for the message he knew would eventually come.</p><p>Because when it finally did, all it did was make the nagging inside him twist before it sank.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Matsumura Hokuto:<br/>
<em>I won't be available tonight.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Matsumura Hokuto:<br/>
<em>I'm sorry.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga had grown used to this response.</p><p>It wasn't too long after they started sharing Taiga's bed that Hokuto started to come over less.</p><p>After the first night Taiga had slept in his arms, he invited him again the next day, refusing to let Hokuto do work for him when he wasn't awake. Hokuto had done more than he could have ever asked of him, he couldn't ask for more.</p><p>Especially when he asked for something as selfish as asking him to kiss him.</p><p>Just so he could try to feel something from it.</p><p>For most of the nights that followed, they simply just shared the bed. Taiga would roll over and face the wall as Hokuto turned off the lights for both of them to sleep in the bed that was plenty big enough for the both of them.</p><p>But some nights when Taiga's mind still restlessly stirred until the early morning, he tugged at Hokuto's sleeve, where it never took more than a few seconds for Hokuto to collect him in his arms in his mid-slumber, whether tucking Taiga's head under his chin or pulling his back against his chest, where his warmth would ease the thoughts in Taiga's head and lull him to sleep.</p><p>Taiga's body had always run on the colder side, making his fingers and toes freezing in the night. He always wore full length pajamas and kept a thick comforter on his bed throughout the year to keep himself from getting sick on cold nights and somehow, Hokuto had become an unexpected but welcome solution to his problem.</p><p>Hokuto was like a personal space heater. Just one that held him around the waist and buried his nose into his hair in his sleep.</p><p>The only drawback was that it made Taiga's nights alone feel colder.</p><p>Taiga didn't know when he started to reach out for someone who wasn't next to him in the middle of the night, but it happened more often than he would have liked to admit.</p><p>Each time when his hand found no one beside him, Taiga would open his eyes to his bedroom that used to never feel too quiet without a heartbeat pounding steadily next to him, sparing himself only a second to think of why he was alone and who was listening to that soothing rhythm instead of him before willing himself to sleep.</p><p>It was as if the moment Taiga came to value it, it started to disappear.</p><p>Taiga stared at the message a second longer before he texted back.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga:<br/>
<em>It's okay.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He set his phone face down as modern rock began to blast over his speaker system.</p><p>"... Juri, I can't say this is exactly the right music to write to."</p><p>"Well, this is all you have, Kyomo. I'm kind of limited to your options here."</p><p>Taiga sighed as he pulled off his glasses, warming his eyes against his palms and he slouched over the counter.</p><p>"I don't think I can write anymore… My eyes hurt and the music completely took it out of me."</p><p>"Hey, don't go saying that I'm the reason why you can't write," Juri frowned as he turned the high paced music down. "They'll fire me for that."</p><p>"No, they won't," Taiga said, his voice muffled in his hands that had moved down to cover his face.</p><p>"There's a first for everything."</p><p>Taiga stayed like that, his hands over his face as the energetic guitar thrummed through his speakers.</p><p>For the first time in his life, the four walls of his home felt like they were closing in on him, his stress and the impending solitary slumber pushing down on his shoulders until his fringe grazed the keys of his laptop.</p><p>Even with Juri in his apartment, there was an absence that grew closer to swallowing him day by day and night by night he was alone.</p><p>"... I want to be somewhere that's not here…"</p><p>"Huh??"</p><p>Taiga was surprised Juri even heard him over the intensifying drumming that came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>Juri took his finger off the pause button as he watched Taiga roughly rub his eyes after letting his glasses fall from the top of his head to the counter.</p><p>"... Did I just hear Kyomoto Taiga say that he wanted to go outside?..."</p><p>Taiga paused, letting the silence sink in before inhaling sharply, his blurry eyes squinting at his screen as he took back his discarded glasses.</p><p>"Maybe."</p><p>He wished he could say Juri was overexaggerating, but the amount of times that he bluntly refused to do anything outside with Juri rightfully justified his large reaction.</p><p>"... Well, shit!!... Let's go out then!"</p><p>Taiga set his glasses back on his nose soon enough to see Juri pulling off his tie "Juri, I have work to do. You have work to do too."</p><p>"I don't have any more meetings for the rest of the day. Some reading tonight and a bit of overtime tomorrow should resolve all of that." Juri rolled up his cuffed sleeves as he grabbed his phone to check his emails one last time.</p><p>"Also, helping Kyomoto Taiga get his well needed break to get his flow back is more than reason enough, right?"</p><p>As much as Taiga knew that leaving his work on a tightening deadline wasn't the right choice, the devil on his shoulder whispering in his ear to run and Juri's enthusiasm as he packed up his things convinced Taiga to get on his feet.</p><p>"... Where are we going?"</p><p>Juri smiled as he clipped his briefcase shut.</p><p>"Don't know."</p><p>"Let's go find out."</p><h6></h6><p>They drove.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>They just drove.</p><p>It didn't matter where, Juri just took whatever road and whatever turn felt right at that very moment.</p><p>Taiga had forgotten how his music taste had never quite lined up with Juri's as he blasted hip hop and R&amp;B over his speakers, driving aimlessly to go somewhere not even they knew. He stared out the window at the scenery whipping by, the sound of Juri's thumbs tapping beside him with the deep base rumbling in the car's frame.</p><p>With each passing minute, there was an anxiety stirring in Taiga's stomach telling him that each wasted should have been spent writing. He tried to ignore it and push it to the back of his mind, but his manuscript being as indefinite as their destination made it difficult to let go.</p><p>The stress must have shown on his face as Juri reassured him again after seeing the unrelenting crease in his brow.</p><p>"It'll be okay," Juri said as he switched the song again.</p><p>"Just let yourself live in the moment for a bit."</p><p>Easier said than done…</p><p>But Taiga did his best as he closed his eyes, letting the tiding tempo of Juri's music empty his mind.</p><p>"Ohh, I see the water." Juri smiled, leaning over the wheel to catch the glimpses of the sea that peeked from between towering buildings.</p><p>"How does the beach sound?"</p><p>Taiga kept his eyes shut as he sank into his seat, drifting off with the calming sway of the car.</p><p>"Whatever is fine with me."</p><p>When the car stopped and Juri shook his shoulder, they weren't at a beach.</p><p>Well, they were in the city, after all. There wasn't a stretch of beach in miles, but Juri still parked and let them out to enjoy what turned out to be just a simple common waterfront view.</p><p>The moment Taiga opened his door, the sea breeze accosted him, making him squint as he heard Juri's wind muted laugh ahead of him.</p><p>"How's this!?"</p><p>The wind carried his voice away, but Juri spoke loud enough for Taiga to hear him as he wore his usual wide toothy grin with his hair becoming a mess in the breeze. It gentled as Taiga made his way over, joining Juri in leaning over the steel railing to look over the wide stretch of water.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as the current tousled his hair.</p><p>"... Not bad."</p><p>Juri chuckled, squeezing Taiga's shoulder briefly before fishing his cigarettes from his pocket.</p><p>"Well, I'm sorry it's not exactly the beach, but this is nothing to complain about."</p><p>The box rattled softly as Juri tapped it against Taiga's arm.</p><p>"Can I smoke?"</p><p>Taiga brushed it away from him, but nodded.</p><p>"Go for it. We're outside."</p><p>Taiga gazed over the waves after Juri thanked him with a smile before he turned his back against the current to light the end of his cigarette, the thin line of smoke being carried away as it began to burn.</p><p>The clear sky allowed the hazy strips of clouds to reflect cleanly against the rippling and waving water below it. There was a distant call of birds Taiga couldn't see echoing around him mixed with the soothing wash of the tide. A chill touched his skin with each brush of the gentle wind as he watched the pure and cleansing scenery.</p><p>Not bad.</p><p>Not bad at all.</p><p>Taiga curled into himself as the draft picked up again, whipping past them as Juri raised his chin against it, grinning as it swept over him.</p><p>Juri chuckled when he saw Taiga blowing his unruly hair from his eyes.</p><p>After Juri reached over to brush away his bangs with the back of his fingers, Taiga could see the warm smile on Juri's lips and his cigarette still tucked between them.</p><p>"You're a mess."</p><p>Taiga watched the smoke rise and curl from the cigarette as he let Juri fix his hair, tucking it smoothly behind his ear.</p><p>Not that long ago, this surely would have made his heart ache.</p><p>He would have wondered how many times he had done something like this with his girlfriend.</p><p>His heart and mind would have been sent into chaos from how wrong it was to want something more than a smile and a fading touch and he would have warred with himself on whether it was truly love or if he was just brought to believe it was love.</p><p>He would have stood there, wishing to stay in the comfort of Juri's smile forever as his chest grew heavy with a lump in his throat he had no other choice but to swallow down.</p><p>But now, at this moment, none of that reached his mind.</p><p>Right now, all Taiga could think about was how cold it was and how warm it was when Hokuto held him.</p><p>The corner of Taiga's lips tugged up as his fingers retraced Juri's touch with his own.</p><p>"You're not exactly orderly either."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Juri took in a deep breath of smoke before letting it all out, the cloud streaming from his lips as he stretched and buried his hands into his hair.</p><p>"It's freeing from all the office manners bullshit."</p><p>Taiga laughed as Juri smiled with him, taking another drag from his cigarette.</p><p>"I thought you were into the clean cut look."</p><p>"Yeah it looks good on me, but it's annoying to put wax in my hair everyday."</p><p>"Do you want some?" Juri asked, holding out the stick before Taiga.</p><p>"No way in hell."</p><p>Taiga pushed Juri's hand back to himself.</p><p>"Even then, at least offer me a new one."</p><p>Juri chuckled as he brought it back to his own lips.</p><p>"Suit yourself."</p><p>They stayed a bit longer, talking about nothing and everything here and there as Juri's cigarette burned down to its filter.</p><p>Taiga rested his chin in his folded arms on the railings, listening and replying, though his mind was filled with only one thing.</p><p>Actually, it was many things.</p><p>But it was one person.</p><p>It was just the small things about them and was nothing in particular.</p><p>One thing just led to the next.</p><p>Like the way he laughed through his nose when he ate reminded him of the way his canines showed when he smiled. How smooth his voice was when he taught. How gracefully his hands moved when he cooked.</p><p>The way he tucked his arm under Taiga's head when they got in bed.</p><p>They way he held him by the waist.</p><p>His face when he slept.</p><p>The mole at the corner of his lips.</p><p>The way his eyes lidded before they kissed.</p><p>Just him.</p><p>Just… Hokuto.</p><p>…</p><p>Taiga adjusted his arms on the railing, pulling them tighter around his shoulders.</p><p>… When was it that he started to notice?...</p><p>He wasn't sure.</p><p>He always knew that Hokuto was undeniably handsome, but when was it that he started to notice the details that made him handsome?</p><p>Or when was it that Taiga started to notice the things beyond just his image that made him attractive?</p><p>He hummed, mindlessly giving a response to Juri's comment about what watch he wanted to buy next as Taiga laid his cheek down in the fold of his own arms.</p><p>… He was becoming greedy.</p><p>Whether or not Hokuto treated him kinder than others, he couldn't demand his time.</p><p>Taiga had to recognize that he was sharing.</p><p>Even if deep inside, he didn't want to.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He couldn't.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked when Juri tapped his shoulder.</p><p>When he looked over his shoulder, he saw Juri shoving the spent smoke into his pocket ashtray.</p><p>"Are you ready to go?"</p><p>Taiga gave the water one last gaze before drawing away, hoping to leave his thoughts behind with it.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"I'm ready."</p><p>They both slipped back into the car, Juri letting out a drawn breath as he shut out the cool sea breeze with his door before taking a mint from the tin he kept in his glove box to cut back the smoke on his breath.</p><p>Taiga buckled himself in as Juri sat back, crunching down on the tablet to spread over his tongue.</p><p>"So. Where now?"</p><p>Taiga took out his phone from his pocket to see no new messages. "Home?"</p><p>"No no, it's too soon to go home…"</p><p>Juri drummed his thumb against the gearshift as he thought.</p><p>"When was the last time you went to a club–?"</p><p>"I'm not going to a club."</p><p>"Alright, then what about a high end bar?"</p><p>"... Do I really look like someone who's dressed to go into a classy bar?"</p><p>Both of them looked down at what Taiga was wearing.</p><p>Taiga didn't take much time to change from his lounge clothes before Juri rushed him out the door, meaning that he was still only dressed in athletic pants and a black shirt with the oversized denim jacket Juri grabbed from his closet on the way out.</p><p>It wasn't really something that felt appropriate for a bar where the drinks probably cost more than the shirt on his back, but Juri turned back in his seat and started the car.</p><p>"... It will be fine."</p><p>Taiga groaned. "Juri!"</p><p>"Don't worry! People go to these places in casual clothes all the time!"</p><p>"I swear, if I don't see one person in there wearing sandals, I'm walking out."</p><p>Juri blindly held out his hand to Taiga as he peered behind him to start backing up the car.</p><p>"Deal?"</p><p>Taiga frowned, contemplating for a second before begrudgingly taking his hand.</p><p>"Deal."</p><p>He only took it because he was confident in it enough to believe he'd be able to go home. There was just no way someone was bold enough to go to a fancy bar like they had just decided to stop by after getting groceries.</p><p>But to his misfortune, there was one man wearing an expensive looking pair of slides at the dimly lit bar Juri led him inside of.</p><p>"... That doesn't count."</p><p>Taiga whispered just low enough for Juri to hear before his back was pushed forward.</p><p>"We never discussed the quality, so it counts. Come on."</p><p>As the sleekly dressed waitress brought them to their seat, Taiga already knew he stuck out like a sore thumb. All the patrons they walked past wore sharp and pricey formal wear while the most he had going for him was that his clothes were at least all black. He just hoped that the defused amber lighting was enough to hide the white stripes down the sides of his pants.</p><p>It was shocking how lately Juri managed to always bring him somewhere that felt out of his pay range.</p><p>In college, Juri always seemed to be strapped for cash while Taiga was comfortable with the funds from his parents. Even now, it was likely that Taiga's wage was higher than Juri's, but he just wasn't the type to indulge in extravagance in the way he did.</p><p>"Just a couple drinks, okay?" Juri whispered to him before slipping into the crescent shaped booth alongside him.</p><p>"Just a couple…"</p><p>The woman handed Juri the menu with a smile while Taiga wished he could slip under the table and disappear as just looking at the other customers around him managed to make him feel poor despite his plentiful savings.</p><p>"Hey, it's not that bad. People can hardly see you from here anyways," Juri said, nudging his elbow into Taiga's arm as he set the drink menu between them.</p><p>"Also if you keep slouching like that, you'll only attract more attention."</p><p>Taiga sighed, feeling like a scolded child as he sat up to glance through the menu where his eyes immediately crossed trying to read the small text.</p><p>The names were frilly and complicated and the list of ingredients under them only made his eyes hurt even before he had put the poison in his blood.</p><p>Sours, bitters, vermouth, triple sec, cointreau, moonshine, whatever. It went on.</p><p>Some of the drinks he could guess the flavor by the name, but others, he had no idea what they taste like besides just alcohol, and after the 4th drink, Taiga gave up.</p><p>"Just get me a glass of wine…" he muttered as he swapped menus for the one containing food.</p><p>"... They have curry here?..."</p><p>Juri propped his cheek on his palm, still studying the list of drinks. "You'd be surprised what people can make expensive nowadays."</p><p>Taiga closed the menu and pushed it away from himself.</p><p>He wasn't mentally prepared to spend 4000 yen on a curry he could make half as decent at home.</p><p>The waitress came back, Juri ordering for the both of them as Taiga gazed blankly past the woman, staring at the booth across that was empty of eyes that could watch him.</p><p>His eyes stayed on the unoccupied booth as Juri handed the woman the menus with a smile and brief words of thanks before she walked away with the order of an aged brandy, a sweeter bodied red wine, and a charcuterie board to share.</p><p>"Are you going to be able to drive after this?"</p><p>Juri took out his phone from his pocket as he let out a tired sigh. "I'll keep it to one drink."</p><p>"I have a meeting early in the morning tomorrow."</p><p>Taiga glanced down at Juri's phone, seeing the surprisingly full schedule on the screen.</p><p>It always seemed like Juri had the free time to just mess around at his home. Taiga hadn't expected that he had actually fine tuned his visits rather concisely.</p><p>He took out his own phone, fiddling with the deep scratch that had managed to raise the plastic on the corner of his phone case.</p><p>"That sucks… Is there something going on?"</p><p>"We're looking at new prospective authors again," Juri said, switching over to his email that always had at least one message unread. "Tons of manuscripts, so little time. Lots of rough to dig through to find the diamonds."</p><p>"Anything exciting?"</p><p>Juri hummed as he crossed his arms over the table. "A couple. There's a couple historical fantasy novels that look interesting and some good coming-of-age stories. But you know how it is, the deep melodramatic plots are popular right now."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"They're beautifully written and emotionally moving when you read them, but sometimes I wonder if some people like to buy them so they can look intelligent when they put them on their bookshelves."</p><p>Taiga chuckled, popping the corner of his case back onto his phone. "Maybe. But what makes money, makes money, right?"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>They both raised their heads when the waitress reappeared in front of them, both of them removing their elbows from the table to appear more orderly as she set down a tall glass with a smile.</p><p>"Red wine?"</p><p>Taiga nodded as she slid it over to him by the stem. "Yes. Thank you."</p><p>Juri grinned gratefully when she placed down his drink, but his thanks was disrupted by a quiet curse as his phone began to ring.</p><p>"Sorry, I have to get this." He gave an apologetic bow as he slipped past the waitress with his phone pressed to his ear.</p><p>Taiga watched Juri speed away to find a place to talk in private as the waitress chuckled warmly, melting the awkward energy left by Juri's sudden departure while she set down individual plates and silverware for two.</p><p>"Rather busy, isn't he?"</p><p>Taiga just reflected her laughter with a polite smile, making up for the small talk Juri left in his wake.</p><p>"Just a little."</p><p>"Let me know if you need anything."</p><p>Taiga thanked her again as she walked away, leaving him in the booth alone.</p><p>For a moment, he just stared at the deep ruby of his wine, sitting silently before reaching over and smoothing his fingers over the flat base to move it slowly closer to himself.</p><p>Somehow… It felt lonely.</p><p>Taiga was far from alone. The room was filled with the low humming of indiscernible conversation and distant laughter of customers while customers and staff alike passed before the front of his booth, but there was a certain solitude that sank into him as it only seemed to encircle him, leaving a void where he sat in silence with only his drink to keep him company.</p><p>Loneliness wasn't really a feeling Taiga was used to. As an only child of a busy family, he had grown accustomed to entertaining himself and being his own company and as he grew older, he often preferred to be alone.</p><p>But right now, there was an emptiness.</p><p>The wine glass touched his lip, but Taiga didn't drink. His eyes were set forward as the feeling in his stomach began to grow.</p><p>… Why?</p><p>He knew Juri would soon return, but the loneliness he felt was only medicated but not cured by his friendly chatter.</p><p>With Juri, he shouldn't feel alone. But yet, he still did.</p><p>Taiga glanced at his phone that laid quiet and undisturbed on the table as he finally took a sip, not wanting to acknowledge that it wasn't about whether someone sat beside him or not.</p><p>It was about who.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around his phone.</p><p>That person didn't owe him any more of his time. That person had his own life and what he chose to do with it, didn't involve him.</p><p>Taiga was just another in the swarm of people that requested his attention.</p><p>Whoever that person decided to spend his nights with, Taiga couldn't say anything, no matter how badly he wanted the hour hand to pass the 11th hour with him still there.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>The screen of his phone woke to an absence of messages as his hands moved by themselves, opening and swiping through the brief conversations he and Hokuto had exchanged before.</p><p>Hokuto's messages mostly said the same thing, but just in different ways.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I'm on my way.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Are you free?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I'm coming over.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Can I stop by?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Can I see you?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga's were the same, saying the same thing with different words.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Yeah.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Okay.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Yes.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I'm open in an hour.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sure.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>But as Taiga scrolled down to the messages of the past weeks, Hokuto's messages had changed.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I can't come by.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I'm busy tonight.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I can't make it.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I'll be out this weekend.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I'm sorry.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>All Taiga could say was that it was okay and that it was alright. He didn't even say anything like "maybe next time" or "hopefully next week" because he couldn't expect Hokuto to make time for him the way Juri did for him on his calendar.</p><p>But that didn't mean he didn't want him to.</p><p>Taiga's thumbs typed each letter slowly, the message growing character by character to say what he wanted to say, but knew he couldn't.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I want to see y  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His thumbs hovered over the last two letters, the echoes of clattering plates and leisurely talk ringing in his ear before one finally moved.</p><p>It jammed itself into the backspace key.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>He can't.</p><p>The cursor swept over the incomplete message, erasing it to leave the textbox empty with only the all too familiar blinking bar waiting patiently for words.</p><p>He typed again.</p><p>
  <em>Are you busy</em>
</p><p>Taiga didn't bother to punctuate before blindly hitting send and slapping it face down on the table to trade it for his wine, drinking it and already wanting to forget that he had sent it all.</p><p>Of course he was busy.</p><p>He said he was busy.</p><p>That's why he wasn't here.</p><p>That's why Taiga wasn't home. That's why Taiga wanted to leave.</p><p>What a stupid question to ask.</p><p>It was pathetic.</p><p><em>He</em> was pathetic.</p><p>Taiga stared at the untouched food as he let his mind fill with only an empty haze.</p><p>He just didn't want to think about him anymore or the abandonment he felt in his leave as his ears heard a sound he believed his head had crafted from the blended noises around him.</p><p>How fucked up was he to be hearing sounds he only heard around Hokuto?</p><p>It was a sound he had only heard a few times before. It was only once or twice when Hokuto arrived at his door before he promptly muted his phone after the first chime and when it pinged in his pocket just before he left with his bags in his hands.</p><p>Both times, Hokuto had apologized.</p><p>If Hokuto had never drawn so much attention to the courtesy he gave him, the sound would have never made it into Taiga's memory, but Hokuto had shown he cared enough to mute his messages during the time he spent with him.</p><p>So Taiga remembered.</p><p>He wished he hadn't.</p><p>He wished it had just been his brain playing tricks on him, forcing him to hear Hokuto's message tone play in a buzzing crowd.</p><p>Because when he looked up to confirm whether he had gone crazy, he saw Hokuto in the booth that was once empty.</p><p>And that woman.</p><p>Hokuto looked just as shocked with his hand over his phone on his table and his arm draped around her shoulders, leaving no space between them as they sat close together at the center of their booth.</p><p>Hokuto was the first to break his eyes away as the woman laid her hand on his chest, smoothing over the black fabric of his button up shirt. He looked down at her, giving her a warm smile and a squeeze on her shoulder, flashing a glance back at Taiga before leaning his head down to whisper in her ear, causing her to giggle in his hold.</p><p>Taiga took his gaze away once he saw her fingers slip between the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>This.</p><p>Hokuto was busy.</p><p>And this was why.</p><p>The empty feeling in Taiga grew, swallowing him from the inside.</p><p>Juri returned, sighing while slipping his phone back into his pocket as Taiga quickly grabbed his phone to delete the message he had sent before.</p><p>"Whoof. Sorry about that," Juri said, exhaling as he sank into his seat. "The chief was asking about some of the references so I had to look up their contacts for him."</p><p>Taiga shoved his phone in his pocket, trying to ignore the way it vibrated against his leg.</p><p>"It's no problem. Work is work."</p><p>"Have you tried the food yet?" Juri asked, sipping his drink and swallowing hard as it burned his throat.</p><p>"No, not yet," Taiga said as he fought the urge to look across the room again.</p><p>"Just waiting for you."</p><p>Juri smiled and nudged Taiga's arm with his first.</p><p>"You didn't have to."</p><p>"It was too expensive to eat by myself…"</p><p>"Well if you're paying, then I have no complaints."</p><p>"You brought me here. You're paying."</p><p>"How about we agree on dutch?"</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Juri chuckled before putting cuts of overpriced cured meats and cheeses onto Taiga's plate and pushed it in front of him.</p><p>"Thanks. Now eat already."</p><p>They talked. Juri complained about his job as he nibbled on his food, describing the worst of the manuscripts with lavish detail and the stifling politics of upper level work while Taiga drank, ate, and nodded while failing to restrain himself from glancing across the room.</p><p>Every time he did, the two were all over each other.</p><p>Hokuto always kept one arm around her, whether it was over her shoulders or around her waist as the woman leaned into it, looking satisfied and comfortable at his side. Taiga saw her feed him, touch every inch of his exposed skin from his neck to his chest as well as shamelessly stealing a kiss from his lips whenever the waiters and waitresses were cleared of the floor.</p><p>Each time, it made a weight in Taiga's core sink, watching her fingers over the collar he studied when he fell asleep and her lips over the ones that had kissed him last they met.</p><p>Only once, their eyes locked.</p><p>Taiga quickly tore his gaze away, not seeing how Hokuto took every second he had before the woman demanded his attention again, or how his eyes wavered before returning to the pull at his chin.</p><p>Taiga tried to focus on Juri's words as he crunched down on artisan crackers, but every time he looked away, his mind's eye showed him visions of when they were together last and how he didn't know when he'd see him next.</p><p>He did his best to keep engaged and keep an active conversation with Juri, but the bitterness that was building inside him made him feel sick.</p><p>That woman.</p><p>That woman had told him that all the women around Hokuto were treated the same. That <em>he</em> was the same. That he wasn't special. But she claimed all over him like she owned him and had him all to herself.</p><p>Was it really so selfish to want to share a meal they had made together?</p><p>Was it such a crime that he just wanted to fall asleep warm?</p><p>The feelings welled up in Taiga's chest, burning as his mind raced with angry words. His grip tightened around his glass, his teeth clashing against it as he went to drink from it.</p><p>Was it really so horrible that all he wanted was to have him?</p><p>Taiga stilled, his cup drifting from his lips.</p><p>All at once, all the anger left.</p><p>All the bad thoughts and all the negative words vanished as the empty hole inside of him grew wider.</p><p>He can't.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>"Kyomo?"</p><p>Taiga blinked as his head was pulled back into focus from Juri leaning into the table, looking over to him with concerned eyes.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"Ah. Yeah. Sorry… I was just thinking about something…" The words left Taiga's mouth without really thinking.</p><p>"... Do you want to talk about it?"</p><p>"No… it's nothing."</p><p>Juri watched as Taiga drained the rest of his glass.</p><p>"Hey. Your lips are stained."</p><p>Before Taiga could try to defend himself from Juri's hand, the other was roughly rubbing his cloth napkin into his lips as Taiga tried to speak past it.</p><p>"Juri–"</p><p>"Hold on."</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes tight, blindly grabbing at Juri's wrist for him to stop and after another hard rub, Taiga pulled Juri's hand away, leaving his lips red and swollen.</p><p>Juri laughed as he brushed the back of his hand over Taiga's mouth, finishing off the work he had done before Taiga swatted his hand away.</p><p>"All better."</p><p>Taiga pressed his own knuckles to his lips as he grabbed the cup of water that was given to them when they sat down.</p><p>"Why do you insist on treating me like a child?"</p><p>"I don't know. I spoiled you since college, why stop now?"</p><p>Taiga didn't answer, choosing to drink his water instead to let the ice cool his abused skin as Juri stretched his arms over his head.</p><p>"Shall we go home?"</p><p>Thank god.</p><p>Taiga had wanted to leave the moment he stepped inside the bar, but now that there was a new reason looming across from him, he couldn't have been more eager.</p><p>"Please."</p><p>They slipped out from the booth, Taiga keeping his back turned to the other side of the room as Juri quickly emptied the rest of his drink.</p><p>Taiga was already fantasizing about running away.</p><p>Once he was out those doors, he could just get in Juri's car, go home and pretend he never saw a thing. He could take a shower, sink himself into a meal that wasn't exorbitantly expensive, curl up in bed and just go to sleep to take him to the next day.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>But there was a major flaw in his plan.</p><p>The flaw being Tanaka Juri.</p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p>Hokuto looked up when Juri called his name.</p><p>"Oh, Juri."</p><p>Taiga clenched his teeth, keeping the curses in his mouth as he stayed by their booth while Juri walked over to the other with his usual smile.</p><p>Taiga knew it was weird to not go over and say hi to an acquaintance, especially when Juri had specifically asked about him earlier, but the last thing he wanted to do was be close to Hokuto when he was with that woman, his arm around her and her expensive looking dress with her hand resting casually on his thigh.</p><p>The most he could muster out of himself was to stand behind Juri and act busy with his phone as he swiped away the notification that held Hokuto's message of <em>Why are you here</em>?</p><p>"I didn't think you liked places like this," Juri asked as he rolled down his sleeves.</p><p>Hokuto laughed lightly, keeping his focus on Juri and not on the way he reached his arm behind him just to feel that Taiga was at his back.</p><p>"Every once in a while is alright, especially if it's for an occasion."</p><p>Taiga tugged at Juri's watch, letting him know he was there as he stared pointlessly at his phone.</p><p>"Oh? What's the occasion?" Juri gave a polite smile as he tapped his finger on Taiga's palm.</p><p>Hokuto's eyes darted to the form behind Juri as he fumbled his words, forcing his focus back into his friend.</p><p>"Oh- It's um–"</p><p>"It's our 5th anniversary."</p><p>Her voice was as smooth and sickeningly sweet as before.</p><p>She sat up, holding out her hand for Juri to take as her dress perfectly framed the smooth soft skin of her chest.</p><p>"It's nice to meet you. I'm Takeuchi Hinako."</p><p>Juri took her hand, squeezing it gently with his own. "Tanaka Juri. It's a pleasure to meet you."</p><p>"My, you're handsome, aren't you?" Hinako chuckled as she eased back into her seat and into Hokuto's side.</p><p>"Why thank you. I get told that often."</p><p>She laughed at his joke, though Taiga knew that it wasn't a joke to Juri at all.</p><p>"I wasn't aware Hokuto had a girlfriend."</p><p>Hinako smiled, her red lips sharp as the corners curled.</p><p>"He doesn't like to talk about me, I'm sure you can figure why, but I always have a little reminder right here."</p><p>From just a glance over Juri's shoulder, Taiga could see how Hinako trailed her fingers over the hand she pulled back over her shoulders.</p><p>Her nails caught briefly on the thin gold bracelet that was always around Hokuto's wrist.</p><p>Juri chuckled. "If it's from you, then I can assume that it wasn't cheap."</p><p>Hinako laughed with him. "Not at all."</p><p>"Since we're having such a nice conversation, would you like to join us?" She asked.</p><p>"Your friend can join us too."</p><p>Both her and Hokuto blinked as Juri flinched, rolling the start of a swear into a laugh as Juri grabbed the hand that had sunk its nails into his palm.</p><p>Taiga dug them deeper as Juri gripped his hand, asking him to stop.</p><p>He didn't like the tone of her voice.</p><p>It had the same venom she had injected into him at Salut and he wanted to have nothing to do with it now.</p><p>All Taiga desperately wanted was to be in the protection of his home.</p><p>"As much as that sounds wonderful and it would be great to know more about Hokuto's lovely girlfriend, the both of us really have to go." Juri smiled, rounding his free hand behind him to pull Taiga's nails out of his skin. "Maybe another time?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Both of you have a goodnight."</p><p>Juri gave Hinako a polite bow and Hokuto a wave of his hand before turning to Taiga with their hands still connected. He spoke in a soft voice as he pushed Taiga's shoulder, moving him towards the exit.</p><p>"I'll pay. You go wait outside."</p><p>Taiga nodded before giving a small bow to Hinako and Hokuto beside her, not making eye contact with either of them before walking out of the bar.</p><p>He had to get out before the strangling in his throat completely suffocated him.</p><p>5 years.</p><p>They had been together for 5 years.</p><p>Why did it feel like he had been lied to?</p><p>This whole time he had just thought Hokuto was single and was playing around because he could, but it turns out he's been in a relationship for 5 years??</p><p>He thought that Hokuto never committed. That there was no single person in his life. That there was no one that occupied his heart as he gave so much of it away. That there was no one had him more, just as Hinako had said from her own lips.</p><p>Taiga pushed the doors open.</p><p>He had thought those long nights Hokuto spent on him were special to him.</p><p>He had thought that gentle voice and worried eyes were only for him.</p><p>He thought he could have mattered.</p><p>Maybe just a bit more than the rest.</p><p>Now, he didn't know.</p><p>"Kyomoto!"</p><p>Taiga swung around when he felt a tug on his wrist.</p><p>As only the lights of the bar illuminated Hokuto's image from behind him in the night that veiled them, Taiga couldn't understand.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>He couldn't understand why Hokuto was before him, looking at him with guilt as if he had done something wrong. He couldn't understand why Hokuto held his wrist so tightly it stung under his grip.</p><p>He couldn't understand why his chest ached when Hokuto called his name in a voice so soft that it felt like he truly cared.</p><p>Taiga stared at him, watching Hokuto's breath curl in white streams in the cold evening air from his lips as the grip on his wrist squeezed before he finally asked.</p><p>"... What is it?..."</p><p>Another breath and the worry on Hokuto's face faded as his eyes fell on their forced hold between them.</p><p>Then he let go, the end of his fingers just brushing past Taiga's hand as it fell.</p><p>"... Tomorrow." Hokuto started.</p><p>"... Are you free?..."</p><p>Taiga blinked, his voice barely on his breath.</p><p>"...... Huh?"</p><p>The moment of time that seemed to stop moving shattered as the metal door loudly creaked open, Hokuto turning to see Juri stepping through.</p><p>"Hokuto? When I didn't see you with Takeuchi on the way out I thought you had gone to the bathroom. I didn't think you'd be out here." Juri patted him on the shoulder as he passed him to stand at Taiga's side.</p><p>"Did you need something?"</p><p>Hokuto's eyes followed the arm that Juri threw over Taiga's shoulder as the hand that had been holding Taiga's wrist before tightened behind his back.</p><p>"No… There's nothing."</p><p>Juri looked cautiously between the two of them. "Um… Okay."</p><p>"Well, we really have to get going," he said as he gradually turned Taiga's back from behind him to lead him towards where he had parked. "Don't keep your lady waiting too long."</p><p>"... I won't."</p><p>The whole time, Taiga had his eyes locked on Hokuto.</p><p>He saw how his eyes faltered to the sidewalk and hesitated, only meeting back with his just before Taiga couldn't turn his head any further as Juri took him away, breaking them apart and leaving Hokuto without an answer.</p><p>After that, Taiga could only gaze down at his feet as Juri brought him to the car, his hand only parting from Taiga's back once they rounded the corner.</p><p>He didn't notice the worried glances Juri gave him as they got inside and buckled themselves in.</p><p>The car was silent except for the jingling of Juri's keys as he fetched them from his pocket to insert into the ignition.</p><p>Juri spoke quietly, his hand set on the key, but not yet started it.</p><p>"... Kyomo…"</p><p>Taiga had his head turned to the window. Even though Juri couldn't see his face, he could see the faint reflection of Taiga's unconfused eyes in the dark glass.</p><p>Juri looked back at the wheel.</p><p>"... Are you sure there's nothing you want to talk about?..."</p><p>Taiga just rested his head against the cold glass, his pale hair falling from behind his ear and over his cheek.</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p>The engine revved to life and Juri put the car in gear.</p><p>"Okay… Just know I'm always here for you."</p><p>"I know… Thank you, Juri."</p><p>They were quiet the rest of the ride home. Juri turned back up his music, humming every so often, but there was no conversation.</p><p>Taiga's phone was cradled loosely in his hands with Hokuto's messages left unreplied on the screen.</p><p>His mind wouldn't stop fighting back and forth.</p><p>Only a few weeks ago, Taiga could have been convinced that he meant just a bit more.</p><p>For a moment as Hokuto approached him with worry in the middle of the night, he thought Hokuto treated him just a little differently from the rest of the girls he saw in his free time. He thought Hokuto might have thought of him just a moment more.</p><p>But Hokuto had someone.</p><p>He had been with her for 5 years. She was the one that gave him the bracelet that never left his wrist. She was the one he could never tell "no".</p><p><em>She</em> was the one who mattered more.</p><p><em>She</em> was the one who Hokuto gave his time.</p><p><em>She</em> was special.</p><p>Taiga was not.</p><p>Then why did Hokuto follow him out the door?</p><p>Why did Hokuto look so desperate to stop him as if anything Taiga thought truly mattered?</p><p>His head hurt. His chest felt heavy.</p><p>He didn't get it.</p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p>But he knew he wanted to see him.</p><p>That he missed him.</p><p>Even if he didn't mean anything, that was enough for Taiga to type on his phone.</p><p>
    </p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga:<br/>
<em>Tomorrow, I'm free.</em></p>
</blockquote><h6></h6><p>The next day, Hokuto knocked on the door and Taiga answered.</p><p>"Welcome back…" Taiga said, stepping back.</p><p>"... Why didn't you use your key?"</p><p>Hokuto just laughed and handed him groceries as they had grown accustomed to doing. "Ah… I just… They were too deep in my bag to get out this time."</p><p>He lied because he knew that saying he wanted to have Taiga open the door and hear him say 'welcome back' as if this was his home wasn't reason enough.</p><p>"You wanted to try to make a quiche today?"</p><p>Taiga set down the bags on the counter, forcing his uneasy feelings down into his stomach.</p><p>"... Is that weird?"</p><p>"It's not really a dinner food, but it doesn't really matter. As long as you're satisfied at the end, right?" Hokuto said as he removed his shoes.</p><p>Taiga's jaw tightened.</p><p>As long as he was satisfied.</p><p>Taiga blinked when Hokuto looked up after sliding on his slippers, catching Taiga's gaze he didn't know he had been giving him. Hokuto just smiled and brought over the rest of the bags as Taiga turned his attention back to the groceries.</p><p>As long as he was satisfied, then it was enough.</p><p>That was the mantra Taiga told himself over and over as they went through the same motions as they had any other day.</p><p>Hokuto showed Taiga everything step by step, assisting him as needed every so often. They prepared and rolled out the crust, lined the pan, diced the fillings and beat the egg mixture to fill the tin all while Taiga tried to ignore the weight that pressed down on his chest.</p><p>Taiga did his best to act normal, as if there wasn't something clawing at him from the inside.</p><p>Once or twice, Hokuto wore a stern face and said his name in a way that implied that he wanted to talk, but each time, Taiga bulldozed through it, asking anything about the quiche with forced curiosity.</p><p>He didn't want to think about it.</p><p>He just wanted everything to be normal.</p><p>He just wanted to have Hokuto's company as he had many times before. He didn't want to think about the day before or about Hokuto's girlfriend, or even about how much or how little he was worth.</p><p>He didn't want to think about how Hokuto looked at him.</p><p>He didn't want to feel the regret he had not knowing when Hokuto would see him next.</p><p>He just wanted to be as it was before.</p><p>It didn't have to mean anything.</p><p>All Taiga wanted was to feel warm.</p><p>Hokuto picked up the remote as he sat in his usual place on the couch, the place Taiga had grown used to seeing him after they finished their meal together. "Do you want to continue the same show as before? Or we can try something else?"</p><p>"... Can we watch something else?"</p><p>Hokuto glanced over to the other side of the couch where Taiga had sunk himself into with his usual blanket before he looked back at the TV.</p><p>"Yeah, of course. Was there something else you had questions about? I can always–"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"Just… a movie or something… Anything."</p><p>Anything was fine.</p><p>As long as it was long enough to keep Hokuto here.</p><p>Hokuto resisted looking at Taiga again.</p><p>Taiga didn't take in what the title was or what it was about before Hokuto pressed play.</p><p>Only that the run time was 112 minutes.</p><p>The animated movie featured a boy who runs away to the city and finds a girl with unusual powers. It played beautiful and colorful scenes that washed over them, illuminating the dimmed room with bright and flowing lights as they watched silently together.</p><p>About a third of the way through, Hokuto stifled a sneeze, making Taiga glance over to see how he rubbed the chill from his arms.</p><p>"... Are you cold?"</p><p>Hokuto looked back, giving a shy smile.</p><p>"A little, but it's fine."</p><p>"Do you want a blanket?"</p><p>"Are you going to share with me?"</p><p>Hokuto regretted it the moment he said it, but before he could laugh and swallow his words back by saying it was just a joke, as he went to reach for his own, he felt the seat cushion beside him sink.</p><p>When he looked over, Taiga was pulling off his blanket from around him to spare some for him.</p><p>"... Are you going to take it or not?..."</p><p>"Uh-... I–"</p><p>It had been forever since Hokuto had been so lost for words, but he couldn't bring his tongue to work as Taiga took a corner to tuck over his shoulder, his temple just inches from his lips as he leaned over him.</p><p>"If you don't like it, I'll happily take it back to myself."</p><p>Hokuto bit at his inner cheek, his chest pounding.</p><p>"No… This is fine."</p><p>As the movie played on, they moved closer.</p><p>Taiga used the blanket as an excuse for their shoulders to touch, whether or not Hokuto was actually taking more than his share as he had claimed.</p><p>The TV projected scenes with vibrant colors as Taiga tugged at the edge of his sleeve.</p><p>He did only as much as brush his cheek against Hokuto's shoulder, afraid to ask with words as if he hadn't already asked Hokuto for everything and more, but when Hokuto hesitantly raised his arm, their desires became one with Taiga slipping against his side and Hokuto placing his arm around him.</p><p>Taiga could feel Hokuto's heart beating against his jaw as his head seemed to fall so naturally in the curve of Hokuto's neck with his arm around his shoulders.</p><p>This was enough.</p><p>If Taiga could just have this, then it was enough.</p><p>He didn't have to be special.</p><p>He didn't have to be the one on Hokuto's mind.</p><p>He didn't even need to matter to him.</p><p>These moments with him were enough.</p><p>… At least they should have been.</p><p>Taiga should have been happy with the moments he got, but the weight crushing his chest that should have been alleviated by Hokuto's touch only grew heavier as Hokuto rubbed his thumb over the curve of his shoulder and pressed his nose into his hair.</p><p>"Matsumura…"</p><p>Taiga's voice was nearly taken away by the dialogue of the movie.</p><p>When he spoke again, he almost wished it had.</p><p>"... Can I call you Hokuto?..."</p><p>Hokuto's hand stopped.</p><p>Taiga pushed away from his side, only enough to bring them face to face.</p><p>He couldn't tell if Hokuto's face was more shocked or troubled, but it only made his chest sink more.</p><p>The colors of the TV played over their skin, dying them hazes of blues and golden tones as Hokuto barely nodded.</p><p>Hokuto really was handsome.</p><p>The lights dancing over his skin curved and cut over his high cheeks and perfectly shaped nose as Taiga reached to follow the line of his sculpted jaw with his fingers.</p><p>"... Hokuto…"</p><p>Even though Hokuto's brows furrowed, they grew closer.</p><p>Taiga looked at Hokuto's lips.</p><p>Hokuto knew.</p><p>"... Is… this still training for you?..."</p><p>Taiga didn't reply. His eyes lowered while Hokuto's did the same.</p><p>The couch quietly creaked from their shifting weight as their noses nearly brushed.</p><p>Hokuto tilted his head to have their lips match.</p><p>"... Taiga."</p><p>Hokuto's phone rang.</p><p>They pulled apart, both exhaling their held breaths.</p><p>Hokuto stood up with his phone to his ear as Taiga tugged their shared blanket around himself, the momentary space they had completely torn apart.</p><p>The movie went on as Hokuto spoke on the phone with Taiga alone on the couch, left only to hear parts of Hokuto's conversation echoing from the kitchen.</p><p>"... I'm sorry………. I know, I just–............. No, of course not I-……….. I'm sorry………"</p><p>".......... I promise… Yes, I swear…................ Wait, I-.............."</p><p>"................... Now?..........."</p><p>"... Does it have to be now?........."</p><p>"But, I-.......... I-..."</p><p>"................. Okay…"</p><p>".... I'll–… I'll see you soon."</p><p>Hokuto came back to the couch as Taiga looked up at him, the hues of the movie still playing over his form in the dark.</p><p>Taiga couldn't read his face.</p><p>It told him nothing.</p><p>"I have to go."</p><p>Finally, the growing weight on Taiga's chest completely crushed him.</p><p>Taiga stared, his chest and heart collapsing and caving in as Hokuto started to gather his things.</p><p>"... Now?"</p><p>Hokuto forced a failing smile as he slung his bag into his shoulder.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Taiga stood up, the blanket falling to the floor as Hokuto went to put on his shoes.</p><p>It should have been enough.</p><p>Taiga told himself over and over again that this should have been enough. He was claiming shared time that wasn't solely reserved for him. He should have been happy that he had any at all.</p><p>Hokuto gave himself to anybody and anyone who asked and he couldn't selfishly ask for more. It had to be enough.</p><p>It had to be.</p><p>It <em>had</em> to be.</p><p>But it wasn't.</p><p>Taiga wanted more.</p><p>He wanted Hokuto to stay.</p><p>He wanted him to hold him at night.</p><p>For him to smile at him.</p><p>He didn't want him to see <em>her</em>.</p><p>He wanted to be selfish. To matter. To be special. To <em>mean</em> more.</p><p>He wanted Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto took the door handle into his hand.</p><p>"... I'm sorry. I-... I promise I'll be back," he said, not able to bring himself to meet Taiga's gaze. "I have to go…"</p><p>The door opened and Hokuto went to step through it.</p><p>"I'm really sorry, Kyomoto. I–"</p><p>The foot Hokuto had almost made through the door pulled back and the words Hokuto tried to say in helpless apology were cut short after Taiga grabbed the collar of his shirt, tugging him back inside.</p><p>Taiga crashed Hokuto's lips into his.</p><p>The door closed behind them as Hokuto's bag hit the floor.</p><p>Hokuto didn't take more than a second before kissing him back as Taiga whispered into their rushed and messy kiss.</p><p>"Don't go…"</p><p>"... Please…"</p><p>"Don't leave me…"</p><p>Hokuto kissed him, rocking their lips together desperately as he held Taiga's face in his hands, panting and sharing his breath.</p><p>"... Okay…" Hokuto breathed into Taiga's lips.</p><p>"I'll stay…"</p><p>He kissed him again, Taiga's hands tugging harder at his shirt.</p><p>"... I'll stay…"</p><p>They pulled apart for only a beat, both of them watching each other's lips as Hokuto pushed Taiga's glasses on top of his head while Taiga opened his mouth, wetting his lips. Hokuto didn't wait to claim the invitation, tasting Taiga's tongue against his own as Taiga buried his hands into his hair.</p><p>It was clumsy and graceless. Taiga had never kissed like this before, giving Hokuto the lead in their deep kiss as Hokuto stumbled them backwards, pressing Taiga's back against the wall next to the door.</p><p>It felt good. Even when Taiga gasped for breath or accidentally nipped at the end of Hokuto's tongue, it felt amazing.</p><p>Taiga gripped at Hokuto's sleeves, his head pinned between Hokuto's elbows against the wall as they kissed again and again, their teeth clashing and their breaths stolen from each gasp and pant. They kissed, letting the persistent ringing of Hokuto's phone blend into the credit music of the movie before Hokuto blindly shut it off, leaving it on the door side table as Taiga brought them to his room.</p><p>They only kissed.</p><p>They kissed after falling onto Taiga's bed until their lips were red and swollen as Taiga quietly suggested sleep, wishing to be held.</p><p>After changing with Taiga's insistence, they settled into bed with Taiga wrapped in Hokuto's arms before Taiga asked to be kissed again.</p><p>The kisses were soft and slow, their noses brushing and bumping until Taiga had enough, burying his face into Hokuto's chest, clutching his hands into the back of his own pajamas Hokuto wore.</p><p>Hokuto hugged him tight, gently cradling the back of Taiga's neck with his other arm wound around his shoulders as if to protect him from the invisible monsters that only came at night.</p><p>As Hokuto nuzzled his nose into Taiga's hair, he had a question at the of his tongue he couldn't ask because he was afraid to know the answer.</p><p>An answer Taiga knew, but didn't want to say.</p><p>Because if he did, then it would be the end.</p><p>Taiga had said "until" and "until" had come too soon.</p><p>For just a bit longer, even if it was a lie, he wanted to feel like he mattered.</p><p>Just like all the girls Hokuto had held before him, he wanted to play pretend and escape, believing just for now that he was special.</p><p>To him.</p><p>Taiga wasn't ready for it to be over.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes, letting Hokuto's warm scent fill him for tonight.</p><p>He wasn't ready to let him go.</p>

  <span>Matsumura Hokuto had only fallen in love twice in his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first time was about 5 years ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had moved out from his small town to the city, bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to do what it took to pursue his culinary dreams. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as everyone knows, the city is much crueler than it seems once seeing past the blinding and glimmering lights.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His first job was working as a line chef in a moderately reputable establishment. The pay was decent, but the hours and labor were grueling, both on the body and mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Day in, day out, Hokuto worked tirelessly until he only had enough energy for sleep at the end of the day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Get yelled at. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Get scolded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yelled at again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Forced to work through the endless aches and pain.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Exhausting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His body was running on fumes with no days to relax as his days off from the restaurant were spent on side jobs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was the only way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he wanted to own his own restaurant, he had to have money, and if he wanted to escape, he had to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So work it was. Even if it meant running himself into the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through some trial and error with different additional jobs, he found a small but chic bar with a master kind enough to let him only work weekends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time in his life, Hokuto was happy to have someone tell him he was good looking, only because it helped convince the master that he was worth keeping around for even just part time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This repeating pattern of his life went on for months.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During the weekdays, he cooked. During the weekends, he mixed drinks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hands and fingers were battered and bruised from the labor, thankful that the patrons turned a blind eye when he served them their drink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Takeuchi Hinako was the first to mention it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, you poor thing… It doesn't hurt too much, does it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was sitting at the bar with her simple but expensive red dress with furs over her shoulders. Each and every piece of jewelry on her body looked like it could pay for more than a month of Hokuto's rent, but the way she was dressed wasn't necessarily out of place. Many customers came in well dressed to the dim bar, but it didn't take a genius to know that her clothes outpriced all and everyone that day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto just smiled and gave her the dry old fashioned she had ordered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, ma'am. I'm quite alright. I just happened to cut myself yesterday. I hope the unsightly appearance doesn't bother you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nearly flinched when Hinako took his hand just before it pulled away from her glass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned his hand over and trailed a caress over the bandage on the side of his palm, chuckling at the way Hokuto's fingers twitched from the sensation in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"To be honest, I actually find it kind of attractive… It's rather manly to have such roughened hands," she said with a sly smile over her lips and a tease in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"They're almost as good as your face."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto chuckled politely before taking back his hand. "Why, thank you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Does that mean you'll order another drink?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was a line Hokuto had used often. He didn't really like doing it. It felt slimy to use someone's attraction to him for the bar's profit, but every sale was worth something, and the bonus the master gave him at the end of every month helped melt all his guilt away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako laughed lightly behind her glass as she took a sip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"From the taste of this drink, I'd have to say yes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The days that followed, Hinako became a regular, always wearing outfits of high value as she sat in the corner seat to talk to Hokuto.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a while, it just felt like casual flirting with intentions no further than playful conversation, but slowly, she asked about him. She asked about his life, his dreams and hopes, all of which Hokuto told her with honesty. Maybe it was the sense of impermanence that made him feel he could open up to her, that one day she would just disappear with all of his stories with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But she came back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And came again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first few times Hinako asked him out for dinner, he refused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a line that had to be maintained between customers and staff that Hokuto held strongly too, but after a month of her persistence, he finally said yes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because he liked her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At this point, Hinako knew more about him than his own parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dinner went well. They laughed over food and drinks and at the end of the night, with the encouragement from both her and the glasses of wine in his veins, he took her home to his cramped apartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By morning, they were dating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako was a bit older, sweet, and came from a wealthy family. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much as Hokuto didn't like to admit it, he liked to be spoiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Hinako spoiled him sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She bought him endless amounts of priceless things. Clothes. Watches. Glasses. Jewelry. Shoes. Bags.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Anything and everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the first year of them dating, she got him a golden bracelet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I want to see you wear it all the time," Hinako told him as they cuddled in the suite she had reserved for them to celebrate, closing the clasp of the chain around his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I want it to always remind you of me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the second year, Hokuto was finally looking at buying a place for his own restaurant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His relentless work schedule paid off, bringing his savings account to a sum he felt he could safely rely on to confidently begin his search. Hokuto toured vacancy by vacancy, diligently keeping notes of the pros and cons of each with the floor plan and layout, but the moment he stepped into the space surrounded by glass walls, the notes were all abandoned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a wonderful ground level occupancy in the city filled with natural light that uplifted the cool earth toned interior. Just walking over the colored tile and through the glass alcove filled Hokuto's mind with the imaginary furniture that would suit the space perfectly to encourage the warm and welcoming air. The living space on the floor above would also let him move out of his cramped apartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Putting it simply, it was perfect. It was everything Hokuto wanted and dreamed of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the price was high.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For even just the bare bones, the rental cost was out of his pay range. Furnishing and completing the inside would already consume the majority of his savings, and with consumables and cost of operations, Hokuto could only reasonably keep the place up at running for a year if he was optimistic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed to himself and bowed to the owner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His dream had to stay a dream for a bit longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can help pay for it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto blinked as Hinako straddled his lap on the lavish couch of the hotel she chose for the night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had just finished lamenting his struggles before she climbed over him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They always met in a hotel. Hokuto knew his apartment was too small for her tastes and her family home wasn't an option. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, no. I can't ask for that. That's way too much," Hokuto said, setting his hands on her hips as she undid the top button of his shirt she had bought for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She chuckled. "Do you know how much I've already spent on you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I want to support your dream. The price is nothing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He frowned, even as she kissed him. "That's exactly why I can't ask for more… I could never pay you back."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako hooked her finger under the bracelet that never left Hokuto's wrist, lifting his hand to kiss the calluses and scars on his fingers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is how I show my love. Are you saying you don't want it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No! Not at all! I just–..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slipped the straps of her dress off her shoulders, letting the fabric drop to her waist as she looped her arms around his neck to kiss him again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just promise you'll never leave me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That is enough."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako wouldn't take any answer but yes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was happy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was thanks to Hinako that Hokuto was able to buy the place he dreamed of. She was there every second as the space transformed, becoming the restaurant he thought he’d only ever see from his sketches on paper. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day after he signed the lease, Hokuto was able to call the best chef he knew from his previous job. Jesse was younger, but had years of valuable experience under his belt and Hokuto couldn't have trusted anyone more to be his lead chef. He knew that he was taking Jesse from a great position, but Jesse accepted without question, thankful for anything to get him out of the hell that was their last employer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No amount of money is worth my happiness," Jesse told him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their beginnings were slow. The customers in the first weeks consisted mostly of familiar faces and friends of friends who all kindly complimented and congratulated them on the place they could call their own. It humbled them the first few weeks, but the flow of patrons began to come in steadily after Jesse had shamelessly used his extensive list of contacts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, the friends of friends who arrived at their door became friends of friends of those friends who told their family and loved ones of the small french restaurant encased in glass. Customers became returning customers, returning customers became regulars and Hokuto nearly cried when he saw the promises of breaking even in their earnings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Salut was running smoothly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt like everything in his life was perfect.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had his restaurant, an amazing staff, a home, and a girlfriend who believed in him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was happy…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But perfect stories weren’t meant to last.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything started to crumble when Hinako arrived at his door with an engagement ring around her finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was in so much shock, he forgot how to cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What about me!? What have we been doing for the past 3 years!? Am I nothing to you!?!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He felt like he couldn't breathe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weight of the world that had once felt so high came crashing down on him, his head dizzy with pain as Hinako stood before him, calm, like it had been any other day. "I've been arranged to marry him since I was 15. We just had to wait until he was 25…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why!? Why did you talk to me if you knew!? Why did you make me think you loved me!?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto clutched his hand over his mouth, struggling to steady his lungs as they fought for air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I do love you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What about </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span></em><span>!?!" Hokuto pointed at the ring on her finger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I love him too."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then why!?! Why did you drag me in?!?!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because I love you more!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No!! Fuck that!! Get out!!!" Hokuto shouted pointing at the door behind her. "Get the</span>
  <em>
    <span> fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>out!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako scrambled to him, grabbing his wrists and holding them to her chest as Hokuto fought back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto!!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now she had tears in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto, please–!! I promise, I love you!!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You can see any girl you want and I won't care-! Please, just stay with me, please!!" she pleaded as the tears fell from the lashes Hokuto had always found to be beautiful. "I love you!! I love you with my whole life!! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span></em><span>!!! Please don't leave me!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto!! I'm begging you– Please!! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span></em><span>!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako had given him everything. He owed her everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew he should have let go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But how could he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was his world and the next world over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto embraced her and held her as she cried, her chest heaving wrapped in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over and over, Hokuto said he would stay. He swore. He promised. He vowed. "I'll stay…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please… Don't cry… I'm sorry, I love you so much."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll stay forever…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But things wouldn't ever be the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto loved her, but his heart ached at the same time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew that Hinako would return home to another man, telling another lie and another tale to erase the time they had spent together just before. He was a person who disappeared every night when she went to sleep beside her betrothed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was as if he didn't exist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was as if </span>
  <em>
    <span>they</span>
  </em>
  <span> didn't exist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's love slowly turned numb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako had told him he could be with anyone. Maybe she had only said it in the throes of her cries to make things feel fair, but it only managed to hurt him more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All it told Hokuto was that she didn't care who she gave his love to. After all, he wasn't the one she was married to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All he was, was a filthy side piece. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Hokuto did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before, Hokuto would politely decline and reject anyone who tried to flirt or approach him saying kindy saying that he was taken, but on the day that Hinako texted him that she would be on an overseas vacation with her husband, when the woman who frequented Salut persistently flirted with him again, Hokuto gave his love away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And flirted back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't really say he enjoyed it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn't take much to make a girl blush. Just a few kind words and a subtle touch was usually enough to make them avert their eyes and bite their lip. It was easy when he knew they were attracted to him, which Hokuto still couldn't understand as he teased every woman who showed interest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it made it easier.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt like payback.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto handed out his number. He accepted every date. He let women come and sleep in Hinako's spot beside him in bed. He gave away everything he once protected so preciously just for her. He gave and gave until it was worth so little that he could convince himself it never meant anything at all. That it wasn't something to be valued. To be cherished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was all just a cheap trick to have paying customers return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to give his whole heart away to make the ache stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jun was someone he thought he could give it to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jun was pretty, kind, and smart. She was maybe only a little unfamiliar with love, but that's what made her endearing. She only started to show interest in him once they talked at the bar after she came again with friends, and not simply because of his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she asked him out, Hokuto agreed, and after it was over, for the first time ever, Hokuto asked for another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It went well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Time with her was fun and easy. It let him temporarily forget that his heart was broken and the pieces belonged to someone who didn't belong to him. He played love with her in hopes that one day it would help cure the numbness that has swallowed him from the inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was ready to ask to see her again, but he couldn’t stop what Hinako told her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn’t know what to think when he saw Hinako sitting beside Jun, her bar stool pushed up against hers as she whispered in her ear with her ruby lips. He tried not to listen to the anxiety pooling in his stomach, wanting to believe that, at most, all it was was playful gossip. He tried to convince himself that Hinako wouldn't try to hurt him as he pushed through his work day, until Jun asked to meet him outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry, Hokuto… I don't think we can see each other anymore," she told him at the front doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The numbness that barely had the chance to subside deepened as Hokuto tried to reach for her arm only to have Jun step back away from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Why?... Did Hinako say something? Jun, don't listen to her, she–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It wasn't Takeuchi… I already knew that you dated around and slept with other girls but…" Her grip tightened on her purse. "I just want to be with someone who will love me completely. I like you, Hokuto..." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... But not enough to share you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto couldn’t say anything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't, because he wanted the same too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That's why he let her walk away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted a complete love just as much as she did. He didn't want to share. He just wanted anything that would stop the emptiness that slowly sank deeper into his core.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Hokuto opened the door to his room, Hinako was there, waiting on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto…" Her voice started soft and slow as if to scold him. "I told you that I don't care if you see other women."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door clicked behind him as Hokuto pushed it shut with his back, his eyes still trained on the floor with chest burning from within.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Then why did you say those things to her?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako's heels clashed against his wood floor when she shot to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Because </span><b><em>I</em>
  </b>
  <span> have to be first!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's back hit the door when she rushed him, taking his face into her hands to force their eyes to meet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You loved her, didn't you!? You were going to leave me for her!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's eyes widened as he grabbed Hinako's hands that refused to let go. "No! Hinako, I–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're lying!!! You're lying to me!! I know you are!!! You </span>
  <b>loved</b>
  <span> her!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would never lie to you!! Hinako, listen to me–!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're a liar!!!" Hinako screamed. "You promised me!!! You </span>
  <em>
    <span>promised</span>
  </em>
  <span> me!!! You said you would never leave me!! You lied to me- How could you lie to me!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako wouldn't listen. No matter what Hokuto said, none of it reached her as she pushed herself into Hokuto's arms, sobbing into his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you know how much I love you!?! How much I spent on you!?!? I'll take it all away!!!" Her nails dug into his clothes as her make up ran down her cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll shut this place down!! I'll end all of it!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's body went dead cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gripped Hinako's shoulders and tore her from his chest as he couldn't even hear his own voice over the ringing in his ears. His eyes were wide as his hands nearly shook.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hinako!!! Listen to me!! Please!!! I don't love her!!! She never meant anything!!!" His voice tore through his throat, nearly quivering as they passed his lips. "There's only you!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"There will only ever be you!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words spilled from his mouth before he knew what he was saying. Out of the things that mattered to him most, he had already lost Hinako.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't bear the thought of losing Salut too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto said words he didn't want to accept. Words that instilled the sinking numbness that would consume his heart. Words that promised the ache would never stop, that he couldn't escape, that he would never feel a love that was whole.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Words he had to force from his mouth to protect all he had left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the years that followed, Hokuto laughed and smiled with only an empty shell in his chest where his heart once was. He played love with the women that came and left his life as a reminder of what he would never truly have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako still bought him everything, but there wasn't a single luxury worth what they once had as he performed as the person he once was during their happiest of days to please her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The numbness became a part of him as Hokuto surrendered to it, letting it consume him until he nearly convinced himself that this was what true love was.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Kyomoto Taiga crashed into him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though, it was more like Hokuto caught him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was rare for an independent man to dine at Salut. Most came by obligation to their female counterpart, be it a boyfriend or family member that was forced to come with them. There had been single men in the past who had come before to give Hokuto a solid look up and down as he served them, but that wasn't all that made Taiga pique his interest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the animosity.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga didn't try to hide that he didn't like him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even without reading the scribbled words in his notebook, Hokuto could tell from the way he averted his eyes, kept their exchanges short and physically repelled himself from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had a rule to never flirt with anyone who wasn't interested, but there was something about Taiga that made him want to push himself closer no matter how much Taiga pushed away. He was like a skittish cat that hissed and bore its claws at him until someone reached out their hand, making it jump and bolt away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There must have been something sick about Hokuto that made him enjoy Taiga's repulsion to him. Every time Taiga flinched or scowled from his advances, something stirred in him that Hokuto had never felt before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The more and more Hokuto learned about him, the more and more he was fascinated by the man named Kyomoto Taiga. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was amazed by how viscerally Taiga rejected romance and love to the point where it disgusted him and made him ill. He grimaced and soured at the mere mention of it, refusing to acknowledge and take part of any of it… Even though Taiga himself had admitted to not knowing what it really was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was impossible for Hokuto to keep himself from getting closer, poking and prodding– teasing and pushing to see at what point Taiga would cave and confess that all his hatred was all just wasted energy. Eventually, Hokuto got close enough to see the delicate face that only ever had a frown in his presence as he trapped him between his hands against the restaurant wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It really was a waste that it was always hidden behind heavy frames…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga's eyes were beautiful underneath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way Taiga blushed and flustered was cute. There didn't have to be anything romantic about that. Hokuto had enough self-awareness to know the difference between a passing thought and attraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the passing thought had become more and more frequent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Each step he got closer, the closer Hokuto grew towards the edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the theme park, even though they hardly knew each other, Taiga had seen right through the lie Hokuto convinced himself was true as Hokuto ignored the showers of lights in the night sky for another glimpse of his long lashes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another step.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During their date at home, Taiga invited him over again, giving him a payment of chocolate mousse from his own spoon, ignorant of the intimate gesture before he fell asleep with his head in his lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn't know he could feel like this. His chest that had been so vacant felt the pricks of a sting when Taiga didn't flinch from Juri's touch before it melted away when he opened his hand to find a key. Back and forth, something inside him was pulled until he found himself cornering Taiga into his couch, asking him if he was in love with Juri. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It scared him how much he had reminded himself of Hinako, asking Taiga as if he had any reason to be upset.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Closer and closer. Stumbling. Sliding. The edge at his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto couldn't get closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew he shouldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had promised. He swore. He </span>

    <span>vowed</span></em>.
</p><p>
  <span>But when Taiga came to him at night, his anger and his rage all falling apart into tears, Hokuto slipped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took Taiga into his arms as his once abandoned heart started to pound, race, ache and sway. It burned, banging at his ribs as Taiga asked him to teach him what love was worth when he himself had forgotten so long ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He kissed Taiga, unable to save himself from the ledge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto fell. Completely and hopelessly in love with Taiga.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Hokuto woke up with Taiga in his arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night before, Hinako had called him and demanded he meet her, but after Taiga kissed him and begged him to stay, he couldn't leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't bring himself to refuse the person he had become so desperately in love with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto swallowed down the lump in his throat and gave himself a few more minutes, nuzzling his nose into Taiga's hair and pulling Taiga's back closer against his chest, trying to remember every detail and feeling of his skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn't mutual… or maybe it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard to tell with the doubts and denial stirring in his thoughts, but whatever it was, Hokuto took every moment believing, despite the pain in his chest telling him it wasn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Taiga."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto barely breathed the other's name into the back of his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yesterday was the first time he had heard his first name from Taiga's lips. Sure, it was stupid and only teenage boys ever got so excited hearing their name in their crush's voice, but Hokuto didn't care. He loved it and wanted to hear it again. Every morning and every night. Just like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With Taiga wrapped in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hold tightened, wanting so badly to simply drift off again with the sounds of Taiga's steady breaths beside him, but his internal clock knew he couldn't stay any longer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He still had to go to work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto pressed his jaw into the curve of Taiga's shoulder, taking and treasuring every last second in Taiga's gentle warmth before finally bringing himself to slip away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment Hokuto unwound his arms from around him, he wanted nothing more than to collect Taiga back in his arms and lose himself in his scent, forgetting about work and the unread messages on his phone, but he knew he couldn't. A quiet sigh left his chest as he sat up in bed, watching Taiga sleep for just a second longer before sitting at the side of the mattress and unbuttoning his shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the shirt fell from his shoulders and he went to get up, a tug on the collected fabric kept him from rising to his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Are you leaving?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn't want to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he had to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No matter how much he wished to stay after seeing Taiga's tired eyes peering past his gathered blanket and tousled bangs with his fist clenched into his shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's chest ached.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... I'm sorry… I have work…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a moment as Taiga's gaze fell from his, the tug tightening before it slacked with Taiga's hand retreating back under the covers. His blanket fell from over him as he pushed himself up from his side, blinking the sleep from his eyes through his mess of blonde hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Okay."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Let me get up with you at least…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A chill already sank into Taiga's skin as he sat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gazed at their feet as Hokuto dressed himself in yesterday's clothes. He had folded them neatly after Taiga caught his breath from their kiss, whispering to Hokuto that he wanted to be in his arms for the night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga wished he could have rewound time back to then as he rose to his feet and followed Hokuto to the door as he always did, not noticing how Hokuto took and shoved his phone into his pocket without checking the screen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His fingers dug into his own pajamas as he watched Hokuto slip on his shoes and take his previously abandoned bag from by the door, ready to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Um-..." Taiga choked out. "Did you want something to drink before you left? Like coffee or-..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smiled, but it was short lived as he glanced at the clock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sorry, I don't really have the time. I'm already late."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have instant. Are you sure?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga wasn't ready for Hokuto to leave again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no telling when he would return. For all Taiga knew, this could have been the last time. Once Hokuto stepped out his door, he would disappear for who knows how long. By the time they could see each other again, Taiga's deadline may be well over, with or without a manuscript. After that, Taiga wouldn't have any other excuse for wanting to see him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But whether Taiga was ready or not, time wouldn't wait for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm sorry… I really have to go…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took everything in Taiga to not pull Hokuto back when the door clicked open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A dirty trick like that was certainly something that only worked once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was pathetic how desperate he was with his voice nearly cracking when Hokuto stepped into the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Tomorrow?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto turned to him as Taiga took the door, keeping it open as he spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Can you come tomorrow?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga could see Hokuto's hand place over his phone in his pocket as Hokuto's words hesitated in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I–... Uh…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The only thing more pathetic than begging for more time was being told he couldn't have it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Not tomorrow… I can't…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It already hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga might as well dig the knife in deeper, right?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Is it your girlfriend?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto laughed, trying to force his lips into a smile. "Well, it's um… She-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga cut him off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's fine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had heard enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It almost hurt more that Taiga could still feel the lingering of Hokuto's embrace as he was reminded how it didn't belong to him, no matter how much he wished to be still wrapped safely within it. Hokuto would go back to her while all Taiga could do was wait until he could live in the brief illusion of Hokuto's affection again, whenever that was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto watched as Taiga's eyes fell to the bracelet on his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Just–…" Taiga's hand tightened around the handle as he slowly began to push the door shut, severing them apart. "Just text me…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Whenever it is that you can waste your time on me…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga was ready to close the door tight and throw the dead bolt locked, bottling up his rejection and shame with it before curling back into bed alone with an emptiness that would consume him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But just before the door latched with Taiga behind it, Hokuto shoved his hand through the crack of the opening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga blinked, stepping back as the door swung back open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"H-Hokut–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whenever they had kissed, Taiga had always asked first. As training, as practice, nothing else. Even when it was Hokuto leaning in, it was because it was Taiga who had sought it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga never could have imagined how different it was to have Hokuto kiss him simply because </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hokuto</span>
  </em>
  <span> wanted to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He barely had a chance to breathe before Hokuto stole his lips. His eyes squeezed shut as Hokuto held their kiss with his hand grazing the back of his neck as Taiga shakily exhaled into it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Taiga could roll his lips back into his, Hokuto pulled away, leaving him breathless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"One week."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"H-… huh?" Taiga barely whispered, still recovering from his shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga watched his eyes as Hokuto tucked his blonde hair behind his ear, the bracelet slipping down his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just give me one week."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto drew his hand back, already missing the feel of Taiga's skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"One week…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Then all my time will be yours."</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>One week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had one week to pull his shit together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In one week, Hokuto had to pull his life up by the bootstraps and figure out what the fuck actually mattered to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After being numb for so long, he finally started to understand what love was worth after it had become so mangled and manipulated. It wasn't about wanting, needing or claiming. It wasn't about give and take. It wasn't even about instinctual sexual attraction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just a feeling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were no "and"s or "but"s. There were no boundaries or barriers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a feeling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no reason for it to be anything more than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn't truly need the whole week to figure himself out. He just needed a week to gather enough courage to do it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For just one week, all Taiga had to do was wait, though sometimes, waiting was far worse than doing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Waiting simply meant that there was nothing he could do. There was no control, no knowledge, no awareness of anything that would happen while he waited for time to slowly move by.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga had no idea what Hokuto would be doing with the week he asked for. As far as he knew, Hokuto could have just fed him lies to give him enough time to disappear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Taiga wanted to trust him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto said one week until… something happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga wasn't actually sure what it really meant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had left him with a kiss and a promise of his time. It wasn't exactly an acknowledgement of mutual affection, it wasn't like Hokuto had dropped to his knees and asked Taiga to love him forever and always.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All it was was time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But sometimes, that by itself meant more than a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the week, Taiga tried his best to focus. There were only two months left on his deadline and at this point, all he could do was place his bets </span>
  <em>
    <span>heavily</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the chief's words of "anything will work as long as there's some promise".</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was certainly something, but if that something had promise, it was hard to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As supportive as he was, Juri didn't cushion his words with compliments before telling him that it wasn't exactly enough. He told him that maybe if the staff was in a good mood, they would consider taking it as a work in progress with promises of improvements in the future, but as it stood, there wasn't a good chance it would sell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri had brought his last editor along with him to get a second opinion on Taiga's work. After reading, she gave him an encouraging smile and told him that it was at least interesting in concept, but Taiga remembered that she had made the same smile after he had killed off her favorite character from his last series. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ironically… for a story about language, I'm having a hard time understanding what you're trying to say," she told him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga knew what she meant because he didn't really know either, but time was running out. He had something and that something had to be finished, whether it was a masterpiece or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tried to work, locking himself in his room with only himself and his document to write, but somehow, the one week Hokuto asked for weighed on him heavier than any of the days of his 8 month deadline.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he stared at his screen, trying to digest the clutter of words he had put on his page, Taiga's mind always wandered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was Hokuto doing. What would come at the end of the week. What would happen. What it meant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What it would mean.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What they would be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What they could be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the days that passed, Taiga's phone stayed silent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seven. Six days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga typed, but the paragraph on his page never grew longer, writing and deleting as his mind was swarmed with doubts, hopes and regrets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Five.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, a decent amount of writing had been done, but it all felt disjointed. Juri had come to look over it and patched it up a bit, but without a complete rehaul overwrite, it was as good as it was going to get.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri ordered takeout from them that night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some authors liked to use alcohol to encourage their writing, calling it the social lubricant for their words. Taiga had tried it before and it didn't seem to help, but at this point, anything was worth another shot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anything, it would help keep his mind off of the number of days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few glasses of whiskey, Taiga was able to write, but he had asked for just a little too much 'encouragement'. His fingers moved, though he wasn't sure if anything would make sense in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, instead of words, the alcohol brought sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga got into bed early and curled himself around his spare pillow, falling asleep with the wish that Hokuto was there to hold him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bottle of whiskey was returned to its place at the back of his shelf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One more day and it would be a week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The previous 4 days felt like they lasted an eternity. The last 6 months of his deadline had seemed to disappear in a flash that Taiga didn't think time could have moved any slower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet, on the last day, the seconds seemed to tick by like the gears of the clock were made from molasses.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga glanced at the time after what had felt like hours was only 20 minutes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was about 9 pm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Salut closed at 8.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed as he leaned back in his chair, staring at the messily strewn together words he had tried to make sense of from the night before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>9:13 pm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…..</span>
</p><p>
  <span>……</span>
</p><p>
  <span>9:14…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…………</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…………..</span>
</p><p>
  <span>9:15.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga got to his feet, using a flimsy excuse to pull on his jacket as he went to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Maybe fresh air will help."</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>"Are you okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The chair screeched as Hokuto flinched, shoving it just a little too hard under the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro put a finger in his ear, wincing as Jesse peeked through the service window for a second before returning to his cleaning without worry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wiped his hands down his apron, acting as if he hadn't sent a piercing sound through the restaurant. "Um… Yeah. Why do you ask?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro sighed, plunging the mop into its bucket cart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You act like you haven't been a space case all day. Do you really think your employees, also known as your friends," he inserted with emphasis, "wouldn't notice at all?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Even some of the customers noticed, it's not like you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto gave him a half-hearted smile as Shintaro frowned, placing a hand on his hip with the other authoritatively gripping his mop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sorry. I've just been a little distracted today."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Shintaro didn't drop his act, Hokuto jabbed his finger into his side as he passed, making the other yelp and reflectively curl into himself from the sharp ticklish sensation. He huffed, hooking the mop into the bucket before quickly following behind Hokuto's footsteps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is everything </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I told you, Shintaro. Everything is fine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro leaned over the bar as Hokuto began checking the register.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bullshit."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you going to take any answer besides a no?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Not really… Well, I could if I'm truly convinced, but I mean– Okay, that's not really the point."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto just kept his eyes down on his work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then what is it if it's not just to harass me?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I don't know… Just wanting to feel like my longtime friend trusts me enough to rely on me, maybe?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's hands paused before they dropped onto the register drawer with a sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why did Shintaro have to guilt him like this?...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro was a great friend and a great worker. More often than not, Hokuto would be happy spilling out all of his issues to him over some hard drinks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this was just something Hokuto really wasn't feeling vulnerable enough to talk about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you, Shintaro… I really appreciate it." He pushed the drawer closed. "I'm not perfect, but I'm fine."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... I'll be fine..." Hokuto corrected.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro pursed his lips, dissatisfied, but knew better than to push.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay… Well, if you ever need a drinking buddy, you know who to call." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto laughed a little. "Trust me… I know."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thank you."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was about time to close up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro took his leave after he finished his mopping job he had momentarily abandoned, but not without making sure to take his revenge by jutting his finger into Hokuto's side with a loud laugh and a wave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto waved back, rubbing at the aching spot as he went to the kitchen to help Jesse finish preparing for tomorrow's pastries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Jesse set down another bundle of chilled dough on the counter, he glanced at Hokuto next to him before pulling the cling wrap off from around it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... You know, you really did seem a little lost today."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto looked up from the tart tins he lined, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand as he gave a bitter smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You too?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse chuckled as he floured his hands to roll out the dough. "Honestly, I couldn't have ignored it if I tried."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What gave it away?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hmm… Probably the blank look you had every time you came into the kitchen…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... It was that bad?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, it wasn't good."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse's laughter somehow always got Hokuto to at least crack a smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a brief respite from the anxiety that was brewing in his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I already heard what you said to Shintaro, so I don't think it needs repeating," Jesse said as he passed the flat spread of dough to Hokuto. "I'm sure you know. I've told you before and it hasn't changed."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smiled as he let out a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held out and swung his hand just enough to tap his knuckles against the fist that Jesse held out to him. "I know. Thanks."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse grinned as he returned to his work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Any and every day, Hokuto." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They finished up using idle chatter to pass the time, Hokuto noticing, but still thankful for the cheerful topics Jesse stuck to to keep the mood light. After cleaning the counters and storing the finished sweets, Hokuto went with Jesse to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'll see you tom– oof-!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto blinked as Jesse wrapped him in a big hug. He squeezed him tighter as Hokuto laughed against his shoulder and patted his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was always strange when his large friend embraced him, but each one of them was warm and comforting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't stay too late. Get some sleep."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay. I got it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto reflected the smile Jesse gave him when he let go and raised a hand in goodbye as he watched Jesse walk down the alley.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And as soon as Jesse rounded the corner out of sight, Hokuto's smile faded as his mind began to buzz again with static.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glanced at the clock behind the bar.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>10:08 pm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was 1 hour and 42 minutes before it would be a week.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto exhaled a tired sigh as he took a glass to polish, pushing away the thoughts of running out the door at exactly 12 am.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every day for the past week, all Hokuto could think about was how badly he wanted to see him. All he could hear were his pleas for him to stay and all he could feel were the lingerings of his kiss and his embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was like he was sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whenever Hokuto told a lady she looked beautiful or that her hair looked nice, he could only think about him and the blonde strands he would tuck behind his own ear as he read and when a woman called his name, Hokuto could only think about how his name sounded from his lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every laugh was </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every smile was </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every voice was </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto set down the glass, the crystal chiming a clear ring as he moved to the next.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just one more day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just one more hour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Hokuto would give everything he had to him and all he could hope was that Taiga would accept it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doorbell chimed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto looked up, setting down his glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Salut was closed, but every so often someone would still walk in through the doors. Sometimes it was just someone who was dead drunk, asking for water or food, or even just a customer who misunderstood the time or was returning in hopes to find something they had lost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto knew who it could be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He also knew who he wanted it to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it couldn't possibly have been, right?... </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He called out as he put down his cloth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Hokuto stepped out from behind the bar and their eyes locked, he froze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Immediately, his heart began to race.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Hokuto?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His chest felt tight as it ached, hearing his name said in a voice he loved and adored.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hardly ever heard his first name from it. The first time he had heard it, it made his heart swell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He loved it more than anything in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He loved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He did love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had loved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto couldn't remember the last time she had said it without the teasing nickname.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hinako…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako dropped her purse to the ground, the gold chain raining to the floor as she ran to him, throwing herself into his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked up at him, hands eyes wide and empty as she gave a hollow chuckle that echoed through the vacant restaurant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Y-you… you can't." Her hands clutched into his shirt. "You can't break up with me… You can't. This is all just a cute joke, right?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is all just a silly little prank!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto took her shoulders, panicked. Scared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hinako, I–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her laughter grew louder as she took his face into her hands and pulled him down to her, not seeing the troubled look in his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course you wouldn't mean that, right?? My Hokkun would never say something like that! Were you just getting jealous? Aww, are you trying to get my attention?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto struggled to get his words out when they were face to face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"N-No– Hinako– Please–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She backed him into the bar, the chairs clattering from his body pushing them away from the counter as Hinako pressed herself into his chest, her laughter fading.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's just a prank, right?..." She smiled with no joy. "Tell me, Hokkun."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tell me all of this is just a joke."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span><b><em>Tell</em></b><span>. Me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto couldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even when Hinako demanded it, hissing through her teeth as she pulled at his clothes, he couldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But silence wasn't an answer Hinako would take.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Hokkun?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her voice was drenched in her sweet tone, hiding the bite underneath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Why aren't you saying anything?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why!?!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto flinched when her voice rose, her desperation beginning to show through the crack of her mask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why can't you tell me, Hokuto?!?!" She beat her hands on his chest, screaming as Hokuto's hands tightened around her arms. "Tell me!!! </span>
  <b>Please</b><span>!!! Tell me it's a joke!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't lie to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he was just as afraid of what would happen if he told the truth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Didn't you say you love me?? You love me, don't you?? You love me!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I- I do! But-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You said you love me!! You said you would never lie to me!! So then why!?" She shouted, shoving her fists balled with his shirt into his chest. "Did I do something?? Did I say something wrong??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please, I'm sorry!! I'll do anything!!!" She began to beg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No! No, y-you didn't-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then why??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako didn't listen. She wouldn't listen. No matter what Hokuto said or tried, none of it ever reached her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was exactly what Hokuto was afraid of. He knew it was cowardly, but deep down he hoped that his long message would be enough. When she didn't respond, he wanted to believe that she had finally woken up and finally saw how their love had become a horrible dependence instead of affection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted so badly to be free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was done being trapped in a love that would never be completely his. He just wanted it to be pure. He wanted to be in love because he wanted to be again. Not because he had to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to have the love that Taiga had for Juri. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So simple that he didn't know it happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shouted, trying anything he could. "I told you!! Don't you understand?? We–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No–!!! It can't be!!" Tears began to fall from Hinako's eyes as she shook her head, refusing to accept his words. "Is someone paying you to say this?? I'll pay you more!! I'll pay you ten times more!! Anything!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just don't leave me!!!" Hinako cried, her tears rolling down her cheeks past her pleading broken smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No! Hinako!!! Please–!!! Just </span>
  <em>
    <span>listen</span>
  </em>
  <span> to me!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's voice echoed through the room when Hinako's screaming stopped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Hokuto wanted to believe that he had finally reached her and that she would finally listen as she stared up at him, eyes wide and full of tears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spoke softly, pleading. "Hinako… Please listen to me just once… I–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's him, isn't it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Huh?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako pushed him away, smiling as she began to laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That boy! The one who came here!! It's him, right???"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's eyes followed her as she stumbled back, laughing as she fixed her cardigan that had fallen from her shoulders, completely bewildered by her sudden shift in mood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"W-what–? Hinako, I–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I could tell he was absolutely in love with you!! It was him! Oh thank goodness it's just him!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could guess who she meant, but he couldn't understand her joy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If anything, he thought she would be furious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What… What do you mean?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako chuckled, rubbing her tears away on her sleeve as she went back to him to fix his shirt. She smiled as she took his hand, cupping her own cheek in his palm with the gold bracelet falling down Hokuto's wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The 1,000,000 yen bet."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's body went completely cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every worry and concern vanished, leaving only shock and fear as he forced his lungs to work, making his voice crack through his throat to say the only thing he could possibly ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... How do you know about that?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hinako giggled, pulling his arms around herself as she looped her arms around his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I saw you talking to him," she said with all the confidence she had lost returning to her speech. "What was his name again? The man in the suit that was with him?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tanaka Juri, was it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He promised you money."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could only hear his heart pounding in his ears. He had to remember to breathe as his breath shook from his chest as he stared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not at the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not at Hinako.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door that he hadn't noticed was cracked open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Taiga who stood behind it, staring back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Listening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to scream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That boy falls in love with you, he writes a romance novel, and you get the 1,000,000. You just sent me that text to make it all that more convincing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"All of this is fake."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, you would never fall in love with a man!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ache.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You would never fall in love with someone like him!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Betrayal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's muscles only listened once the door had closed, nearly pushing Hinako to the floor as he ran to the entrance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto??" Hinako gasped as he caught herself on a chair. "Where are you going?!?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop!! Come back!!!" She screamed at Hokuto's back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span><b><em>Please</em></b><span>!!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her voice didn't reach him as Hokuto was already out the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga, wait!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Just let me–!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wasn't sure what hurt more, the sting on his palm after he was swatted away from reaching Taiga's hand, or the cold empty tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't follow me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto tried again. He grabbed Taiga's shoulder, trying to stop his feet from taking another step further. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Further from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga," he begged as Taiga shrugged him off. "Please let me explain–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't do anything but follow as Taiga refused to listen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga… Please… Please stop… Let me explain. I'll explain everything. Just–... Just give me a chance."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please, Taiga…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto hated how he was pleading just like Hinako had been just before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please… Taiga, just talk to me!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But what other choice did he have?...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Please!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was ready to plead forever until Taiga snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why should I?!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His feet stuttered back when Taiga swung around, finally facing him as they stood at the center of the bridge by Salut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto thought he would know what to say. He wouldn't have chased him if he hadn't, but the moment Taiga turned to him, every word from his mouth was lost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never wanted to see him make this kind of face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had said so before when no one could hear just how deeply he had fallen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hurt more knowing that </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> was the reason Taiga's eyes were filled with ire and regret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why should I stand here and listen to </span>
  <b>you</b>
  <span>?? Just so I can let you lie to me more??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What could you possibly tell me that makes it worth standing here one more second with you?? That you didn't make a bet with Juri?? That I wasn't all just a game this whole time???"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What is it, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Matsumura</span></em><span>?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hearing Taiga return to his last name stung.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took so long for that distance to close. It was just a name. All it was, was a name, but it made Hokuto believe that there could have been something. That Taiga felt something for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, that was all gone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga's eyes blazed as his mouth snapped out his words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tell me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tell me Takeuchi was lying. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tell</span>
  </em>
  <span> me that you didn't make that bet– Tell me with that </span>
  <b>
    <em>fucking</em>
  </b>
  <span> bracelet on your wrist that she was lying!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to. More than anything, he wanted to say that it all wasn't true. Just so he could return to holding Taiga in his arms for at least one more night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he couldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was sick of lying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted it to be real and he wanted to be himself. He wanted to be honest with his heart and know that the person who listened would accept it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was tired of bending the truth just to make things work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was done lying, even if it only made it worse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... I-... I can't…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga's fists clenched. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why…? Tell me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ta– Kyomoto, just listen to me. I was never going to take the money, I–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto tried to close the distance that seemed to grow with each passing second, reaching out to take Taiga's hand, but Taiga pushed his touch away from him, retreating back again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Fuck that!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why should I believe you!? You lied to me!! This whole time you lied to me!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No!! That's not true!! I meant everything!! Please, Kyomoto, just–!" Hokuto tried to reason, but Taiga only clutched his head as he yelled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shut up!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shut </span>
  <b>
    <em>up</em></b><span>!!!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a second, Taiga nearly fell for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a second, he wanted to forgive everything and listen, taking and accepting Hokuto's sweetened words, just so he could go back to believing he had Hokuto's warm smile. That he could really have the time Hokuto promised him just a week before, but the pain in his chest still burned as he bit at his inner cheek, the anger flooding over his despair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's just as she said, isn't it??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Everyone is the same!! No one matters!! We're all just plaything for you to fuck around with until you get bored!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Except for </span>
  <b>her</b>
  <span>."Taiga pointed past Hokuto towards Salut. "She's the one you can never say no to, right? She's the only one you </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> care about!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No one else matters."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga had fought so hard to deny it. He wanted to believe in Hokuto. Even despite all of Hinako's words, he had tried so hard to believe that all of Hokuto's kind and comforting gestures and words all could have been real.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as Taiga's words spilled from his lips, it was as if each of them became true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It never mattered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It never meant anything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He never mattered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> meant anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To Hokuto, Taiga had always meant nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga let out a bitter laugh as Hokuto stared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... I just took more of your time because I came with a cash prize."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those words made Hokuto's heart sink enough to force his voice from his chest. "No!! It's not like that!!! Kyomoto, if you would just </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span> let me speak–!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why should I?? Just so you can just pump me full of your lies!?! No!!! I won't listen!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All of it hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga wanted so badly to listen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to listen to Hokuto tell him in his warm voice that it all wasn't true. That he was wrong. That he mattered. That he was worth something. That he meant something. That he was worth something to </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span></em><span>. That all gentleness and care actually meant something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That Hokuto loved him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a week, Taiga thought it was all true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But how could he possibly believe in any of that anymore?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I have you all figured out…" Taiga breathed, refusing to let the stinging in his eyes bring tears. "You're exactly the person I thought you were from the very beginning."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're just a lecherous piece of shit!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Things like love don't mean anything to you!! You just use your looks to take advantage of women but so you can live as a self serving selfish bastard!!! It's not anything to you!!! It's just a tool for you!!! You don't care how it makes people feel!!! It's all about you! Only you!! You and her!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You don't know how it feels for it to hurt, do you!?!? No one has ever told you no, have they??? That's why you don't care!! You only care about yourself!!!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words burned in Taiga's throat. "I'm the same!! I'm just the same as everyone else!!! Money was all I was ever worth!!!! You just </span>
  <em>
    <span>used</span>
  </em>
  <span> me!!!!! You disgust me!!! I'm sick of you, you and your </span>
  <b>
    <em>fucked</em>
  </b>
  <span> up idea of—!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And what about </span>
  <b>
    <em>you</em></b><span>!?!!" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Hokuto screamed back, Taiga's tongue tripped, cutting off his hateful speech.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's voice felt like it pierced through him, making Taiga's head snap up to meet the eyes that had only watched him even now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had taken so long for Taiga to believe he could understand the messages in Hokuto's eyes, but now, when it mattered most, he couldn't read them at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bite in Hokuto's voice sank into his heart, but then why did it look like tears could have built in his eyes?...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga didn't understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hopelessness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remorse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You used me too!!!" Hokuto yelled, his speech nearly cracking in his throat. "You pulled me around and pushed me back and forth just because Juri never loved you!! You used me as a cheap replacement!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What could you </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> understand about me!?! You don't know anything about me!! It was always about </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span></em><span>!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For years, Hokuto had held back his voice. For so long, he had kept his mouth shut because he was afraid of what would happen if he did. He had always kept his lips sealed, nodding and agreeing with Hinako because he believed he loved her and that his silence would bring him a 'Happily Ever After'.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the first time, he had a reason to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A reason to escape. A reason to finally do something for himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga had shown him it could be different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For Taiga, he wanted to speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga made him feel free. Taiga made him feel as if he could finally understand why love could be worth so much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to say he would be back at his door tomorrow. He wanted to say that Taiga had all his time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to tell him just how much he loved him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yet, his anguish and anxiety of losing it all took control as he screamed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What Taiga yelled at him made him feel like a stranger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those moments where Taiga seemed to understand everything about him felt so distant and foreign.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could Taiga ever understand what he went through?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could he ever understand the ache he felt watching Hinako return home to another man every morning? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could he ever understand how long his heart had been battered and bruised?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could Taiga ever know just how much he wanted to feel love again?...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How could you </span>
  <em>
    <span>possibly</span>
  </em>
  <span> understand anything about me!?!!! How can you tell me how fucked up my perception of love is!?!!?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span><b><em>You</em>
  </b>
  <span> don't even understand it!!!!!!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Screaming back felt good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally</span>
  </em>
  <span> use his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as soon as his high faded, all the regret and guilt flooded back, dragging him back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Hokuto regained his focus and caught his breath, Taiga didn't say anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He just stood there. Silent and wide eyed.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Shattered.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's heart fell into his stomach when Taiga's feet began to turn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything was falling apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wait–"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto tried to grab his arm, but Taiga tore himself out of his grip before striking his hand away from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga didn't yell. He didn't scream.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn't have the energy to anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was right.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga didn't understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Things like romance and love never made any sense to him. He didn't understand how someone could be so important or how teenagers cried over break-ups. He didn't get how someone could willingly give up half of their heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't understand how someone could always be on their mind. How someone could always want them beside them. How someone could simply just want to see their smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga never understood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But for the first time, he wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for one week, Taiga thought he had.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His chest felt cold, surely only because he knew what it was like for it to be warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't touch me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga looked at Hokuto one last time, the throbbing in his head too painful to bring tears as his speech barely came out with his breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wouldn't let the way Hokuto looked at him sway his heart, no matter how desperately he called for him or how badly Taiga wished to run back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head, eyes locked with Hokuto's.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't come near me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Enough of his sweet words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't call me. Don't text me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was done with the safety of his embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't touch me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wouldn't let Hokuto have any more of his heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> show your face in front of me ever again."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Taiga walked away, all Hokuto could do was watch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not once did Taiga look back, no matter how much Hokuto wanted him to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What could he do?... Nothing he could say would change anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He truly loved him, whether Taiga would have believed it or not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted Taiga to be the one to set him free. To teach him what love was really worth, what a true and pure love really felt like.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>… It didn't matter now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga would never ask for him again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto collapsed, dropping his back against the concrete barrier of the bridge as he curled into himself, grabbing at the back of his hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His lungs shook as he brought himself to breath before tears flooded his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was over.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Hokuto turned when he heard footsteps behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he saw who it was, he turned back to the front door of Salut to unlock it, now knowing it was the absolute last person in the world he wanted to see. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“... What the hell are you here for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri watched Hokuto pull out his keys from his back pocket before letting out a quiet sigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pointed at the collection of keys in Hokuto’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn’t need to know which key he was asking for because he already knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deep inside, he wanted to keep it. He hoped that he could have, even if it would only hang there unused until it was lost as it was a memory of what once was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it was also a reminder of what would never be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto scowled before prying open the ring and tugging off the one key that was added to the many he had had for years. His feet dragged as he stepped over to Juri and shoved it into the chest of his three-piece suit before returning to the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"There. Now get lost."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri sighed again, taking the key to grasp tightly in his hand as he watched Hokuto struggle for the first time with the front door, jamming the key into the lock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up. I don’t want to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This whole thing with Juri showing up at Salut alone was much too close of a reflection of that night for Hokuto to feel anything but bitterness. The only difference was that last time, he was closing instead of opening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That night many months ago, Juri and Hokuto had made a deal.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri had shown up at the front door as an old friend wanting to reconnect after moving away to sit down for just a couple drinks.  </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Hey Hokuto. You know a lot about romance and stuff, right? You're able to attract all these girls here,"</span>
  </em>
  <span> Juri had said then.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had smiled as he set his chin in his palm, leaning over the bar and watching Hokuto polish the last few glasses. </span>
  <em>
    <span>"I know a guy who could really need some help…"</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Do you mind giving me a hand?"</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted so badly to shut the door in Juri's face after slipping inside Salut, but his conscience got the better of him, choosing not to potentially injure his friend who followed in after by impulse. Even when he was pissed at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto walked to the register, not sparing Juri any courtesy or service as he didn't even face him to speak. "If you’re going to come in, you have to be a paying customer."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you even ready to serve anything?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No. So, get out."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri frowned, crossing his arms with his briefcase still in hand as Hokuto tried not to take out his anger on the cash register.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It won't be long. Just listen to me for a second."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga didn't give him that grace. Hokuto didn't have to give it to Juri either, but Juri showed no signs of leaving and Hokuto didn't have the energy to physically carry him out the door, settling on the silent treatment instead. The idea was that if he just didn't respond, maybe Juri would just give up and leave, finally giving Hokuto some peace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, Hokuto knew Juri well enough that it wouldn't work that easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That asshole was always so persistent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you want to ignore me, that's fine," Juri said as Hokuto did his best to turn his voice into white noise. "I just want to make one thing very clear…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I never told you to fall in love with him."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri didn't flinch when Hokuto slammed the register drawer shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wished he could have done the same with Juri's mouth, but all he could do was let it keep on running as he went to fix the tables, trying to find something to do besides listening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pulled the chairs off and shoved them under their tables as Juri just stood and watched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's obvious you're mad at me. And that's fine, be pissed off all you want, but you can't pin this all on me. All I asked you was to teach him about love."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto jammed a chair in with a deafening screech on the floor, hating that he knew the sound nor the rage would stop Juri's words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I wanted to help you. You needed money, right? You weren't going to just take it. I gave it a reason. You accepted the bet on your own."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crashing of the wood against the hard floor boomed through the room after Hokuto had planted his hand on the back of the seat and sent it flying under the table, not caring how it bashed into the furniture and fell to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span><b><em>Why</em>
  </b>
  <span> are you here?!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto couldn't keep his blood from boiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Did Juri just come in here to make him more miserable? To tell him his one outlet to blame was invalid?? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew he was putting it all on Juri. He knew Juri was right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto just wasn't ready to accept that he was the only one to blame for why Taiga was gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His heart was already broken. Did he really have to carry the weight of the blame now too?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All he wanted was to make Juri the villain for just a bit longer. Just until he wouldn't be completely crushed by the responsibility. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It only pissed him off more seeing Juri standing there, calm and collected, like he had any right to feel that he was above him while every second that passed, Hokuto felt like he was going to fall apart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You're the other half of the deal! Why are you lecturing me like you're not just as fucked up as I am!!! Are you not also in deep shit??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto barked at him, saying anything to make him feel better. Anything to alleviate the crushing weight on his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then why??"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto blinked, his chest still heaving, when Juri raised his hand from across his chest to show the key that was tucked between his fingers. "My payment."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"He told me if I brought him this, he would let me inside to state my case for 5 minutes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri slipped the key into his breast pocket, adjusting his clothes as he spoke. "I'm planning on getting on my hands and knees and begging for forgiveness."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If that doesn't work, then I'll do it again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next until he does."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So, yes. I'm in deep shit. I could lose my job, but frankly, I'm more concerned about losing an important friend. He doesn't have to forgive me, but I'm going to try like hell to fix what I can."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So." Juri exhaled as he dropped his briefcase back at his side. "What are you planning to do?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Under Juri's focused eyes, even after all the yelling and cursing, Hokuto found himself speechless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn't know. He honestly hadn't even considered it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After what happened, he didn't even think that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> do anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mouth opened as he stammered, lost for words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I-... I don't-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door rang as Jesse stepped inside, his usual direct line to the kitchen interrupted by Hokuto and an unfamiliar guest. He raised an eyebrow as he tugged at the strap of his bag on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh. Uh, good morning?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri turned, presenting his usual business smile to him as if Hokuto hadn't been screaming at him just earlier.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good morning! Sorry for intruding."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse glanced at the chair laying on its side on the floor before looking back to Juri who approached him, side stepping around him to reach the door. "Was there something you needed?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nope! I got everything I need. Thank you for asking though," Juri smiled as he pushed at the handle for his exit before turning behind him one last time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gaze that Hokuto let fall to the ground jumped up to him when Juri's cheerful tone changed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Contact me if you need anything, okay?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smile on his face was gone, leaving only the concern in his eyes before he disappeared behind the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Hokuto and Jesse watched it close shut in silence before Jesse glanced over to Hokuto who was still frozen in place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Hokuto?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Are you alright?..."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto finally breathed, his body reanimating as everything started to sink in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... No."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm not."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was there that could he possibly do?...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga would surely forgive Juri. After all, he has loved him once. Or still did, for all Hokuto knew.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even if he were to do the same thing, begging on his hands and knees with his forehead pressed to the floor, Taiga wouldn't forgive him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had said terrible things. He had done terrible things, but even still, Hokuto really truly loved him despite everything and that was what hurt the most.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the beginning, the money was always meant to free him from his debt with Hinako. He accepted the deal without a second thought because he could already imagine himself pushing the cash into her hands and telling her that he was done, that he was done fooling himself into believing that he was fine having payments as her affection while she held the key to the financial shackles around his wrists.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as the months went by, he never expected that he would have found more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga's love would have been enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the beginning, the only reason why Hokuto pushed to know more about Taiga was for the 1,000,000 yen. Juri had described him and Hokuto recognized him from the month before when he came in for the company party. The cash was the goal, but as time went by, Hokuto had to remind himself where it all started as he kissed him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn't need the money anymore. He didn't even want it, as long as he had Taiga. With Taiga, he could turn Juri down and endure saving coin by coin until he could set himself free. Until he could give Taiga his everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The money was worth nothing compared to Taiga's kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now he was left with nothing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing, as days, months and years blurred past with Hokuto never gaining the courage to call the number Shintaro eventually deleted from his phone for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No money. No Taiga.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even Hinako.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just an image of a future that he had once hoped would come true. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One with Taiga beside him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And a love worth everything.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Thank you, please come again."</p><p>The elderly woman smiled and thanked Hokuto, taking the plastic bag filled with her purchases from his hand before the tiring repeated jingle of the sliding doors played as she left.</p><p>Hokuto watched her leave, the doors coming to a close behind her as he sighed, listening to the quiet giggling of the teenage girls assigned as his coworkers softly echoing through the convenience store.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "The weather is warm again today. Be careful as the air is humid and will increase the feeling of today's heat. Make sure to use air conditioning as needed–" </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>The weather forecast played from the monitor mounted above the register, registering in Hokuto's ears as white noise as he took the broom and brush pan to sweep while the store was empty of customers.</p><p>It had been 3 years since he last saw Taiga. </p><p>After going back to Salut that night, Hokuto finally unloaded his whole heart to Hinako, telling her he was done feeling like second best and nothing but a physical playtoy for her pleasure. No matter how much she cried, Hokuto wouldn't listen, his heart cold and numb after watching Taiga walk away.</p><p>A month or so after, Hinako arrived at his door with an apology.</p><p>The moment he saw her, he expected her to throw herself at him, crying and begging for him to stay with her as she did when he finally said they were over when he returned to Salut, but from the way she spoke, it was hard to turn her away.</p><p>It had been forever since Hokuto had heard her talk in a voice so soft and genuine, it almost felt like they had turned back time. </p><p>"Hokuto… I'm so sorry… I've been horrible to you…" she said as she clutched her purse in her hands. "I was selfish and only did what and what I needed…"</p><p>"But this time, I promise I'll listen…"</p><p>"I love you, Hokuto… I can't imagine my world without you."</p><p>"Please… give me one more chance."</p><p>Any normal person would have said no.</p><p>By every means, Hokuto should have said no, but the emptiness and ache that had sunk deep into his chest over the months alone made his heart cling to anything that could possibly mend its broken pieces. </p><p>Hinako had been his world before. Maybe she could be his world again.</p><p>Hokuto and Hinako tried to make things work. </p><p>The Hinako that Hokuto had let into his home was different. She was sweet, kind and patient as she loved him sweetly. There were no gifts, expensive dinners or luxurious hotel rooms. It was just them. </p><p>Again, Hinako spoiled him.</p><p>Just not with items of high price tags, but with her time and her care as they spent their quiet evenings at each other's side. Hinako still returned home to her husband every night, but not without first pressing a longing kiss to his lips before she left.</p><p>And as Hinako promised, she listened.</p><p>She listened, agreeing to a simple dinner at home, letting Hokuto serve and pamper her as he had wanted to for so long, knowing and feeling her affection in simple words.</p><p>It was everything Hokuto could have asked for.</p><p>Years ago, Hokuto had dreamed of nights like this, finally having Hinako curled into his side as the wasted daylight away watching TV as if they were the only two people in the world.</p><p>Years ago, Hokuto's heart would have soared.</p><p>But his heart had changed.</p><p>As Hinako kissed him, it yearned for a different kiss. As Hinako hugged him, it wished for a different embrace. A different scent. A different warmth.</p><p>A different love.</p><p>As much as Hokuto tried to drag back the love he had from years ago to the surface, he couldn't.</p><p>Hinako had noticed too.</p><p>"... Hokuto?..."</p><p>Hokuto's eyes fluttered, coming back to focus from Hinako calling his name as she was tucked against his side.</p><p>The movie that played before them was one that he had seen before, but back then, he hardly could hear any of the words. Back then, all he could hear was the heart beat of the man beside him as it played through its runtime of 112 minutes.</p><p>When Hinako had asked him if he had seen it before, he didn't exactly lie when he said no. </p><p>After all, he never did end up watching the ending.</p><p>"Sorry… Did you say something?" Hokuto said, giving her shoulder a squeeze.</p><p>"... I did…"</p><p>"Oh… I'm sorry, I just–…" </p><p>He couldn't admit that even with her at his side, his mind was with someone else.</p><p>"I was just thinking about work…" he lied. "What were you saying?..."</p><p>Hokuto blinked when Hinako pulled away from him and clicked off the TV.</p><p>For a moment, he thought she was mad. That maybe, that side of her that had laid dormant for the past weeks would resurface and return them to where they were before.</p><p>"I was just saying…"</p><p>But her voice was soft… though her words still stung more than Hokuto would have thought.</p><p>"You don't love me anymore… Do you?..."</p><p>"I'm making you miserable."</p><p>At first, Hokuto lurched forward, conditioned to shout and deny, to again, tell her over and over that his love was true. </p><p>"No– Hinako, I'm sorry. I just–"</p><p>Hokuto would have never imagined that she would be the one to ask for the truth as she placed her hand on his chest, her eyes gently asking for earnesty.</p><p>"Hokuto… It's okay… you can be honest with me," she smiled gently.</p><p>"I'm ready to listen."</p><p>Hokuto hadn't realized tears had fallen from his eyes until Hinako leaned in to brush them from his cheek.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Hinako…" His voice came out only as a whisper as she held his cheek. </p><p>"I'm sorry…"</p><p>Once his tears had stopped, they quietly agreed to part.</p><p>Hinako collected her things, placing them into the large designer purse Hokuto hadn't realized she had brought with her.</p><p>She must have arrived knowing how the night would end.</p><p>Hinako never carried more than she needed.</p><p>"Will you be okay?" Hokuto asked as she threw away her spare toothbrush and folded her scarf into her bag. </p><p>"Don't worry, Hokuto… I'm a big girl now. I can handle it." Hinako chuckled, standing with the straps grasped in her hands.</p><p>"I decided to tell my husband that I want to be closer to him." She wore a big smile as she turned to him, brushing down his collar for him one last time. "I've been reading a lot lately. It's been comforting and it gave me a little push I needed to move in the right direction."</p><p>Hokuto's brow pinched, watching her turn towards the door. He knew that she used to love reading once, but he had thought it was a hobby long gone.</p><p>"I'm happy to hear that it's been helping you… Was there a book that caught your interest?"</p><p>"No, not particularly."</p><p>"Then what–"</p><p>"Let's just say it's a secret," she laughed, unlatching the door as Hokuto decided to let his curiosity go. </p><p>Before she stepped out, Hinako perked up as she turned on her heels. "Oh! As for Salut's rent, I can still–"</p><p>"No." </p><p>She blinked as her hand paused on the all too familiar envelope in her bag. As she looked up at him, Hokuto suddenly felt awkward, but he smiled to push the feeling away.</p><p>"I-… I won't take money from you anymore…"</p><p>"I won't rely on you anymore… or I'll never move on."</p><p>There was a certain somberness that washed over them as they fell silent.</p><p>Even though they no longer had any love between them, it didn't change the fact that there was once a love that was now coming to an end. No matter how mangled and twisted it was, both of them had once cherished it and treasured it dearly.</p><p>Hinako sighed with a smile on her pink tinted lips, letting her mourning disappear with her breath before she shoved the envelope into his chest, making Hokuto stumble back.</p><p>"Hinako–"</p><p>"Just take this last one." She took Hokuto's hand to place it over the white parcel on his chest. "As my apology… for everything…"</p><p>As she stepped out the door, Hinako stole one last kiss from his cheek.</p><p>"And thank you for loving me."</p><p>The envelope only held enough to pay rent for one more month.</p><p>Maybe Hokuto should have just let her continue to pay as a way to make up for the years of emotional battering, but couldn't bring himself to accept it, not if he wanted to set both her and himself free. </p><p>Salut was doing well and was better equipped to support itself since its hard beginnings, but it was still far from being able to pay its own rental fees without Hinako's support. </p><p>Hokuto couldn't bring himself to cut Jesse or Shintaro's pay, they already worked for less than what Hokuto wished he could pay them and it wasn't their fault for the choices he selfishly made himself. He tried to run the costs of selecting cheaper vendors or buying in bulk, but nothing would save enough spendings without hindering the business or sacrificing its quality.</p><p>All Hokuto could do was take loans and offer his physical labor to make ends meet.</p><p>The master at the bar he used to work at was more than excited to hire him during weekend evenings again while Hokuto was able to work out a schedule with a nearby convenience store during the day.</p><p>If it sounds tiring, it's because it was.</p><p>Hokuto barely had the time to rest, working 7 days a week, mornings, days, and evenings to earn as much as he possibly could before all his free time was spent on sleep. Even then, only after Jesse and Shintaro cornered him and argued with him on cutting their own pay, Hokuto was able to pull together enough to afford their rent.</p><p>It was exhausting and ran him down to the bone, but in a way, it made the last 3 years easier to handle. </p><p>Just as Taiga told him that last day, Hokuto never called or messaged. </p><p>He didn't even ask Juri about him, despite his well intended offer. There was no point. There was nothing that could change anything. </p><p>Not once did Hokuto ever doubt his words. </p><p>Taiga said he never wanted anything to do with him again.</p><p>Hokuto had no reason not to believe him.</p><p>So Hokuto let himself be consumed by his work until Taiga became a blur in his past that came as quickly as it disappeared. Whatever Hokuto had hoped they would be or wished they would have been slowly died and faded with time as he sold himself to his work. </p><p>Slowly, the sound of the smooth tenor of his voice became tarnished and distant. The rich color of his eyes became dull and hazed.</p><p>The gentle hesitance of his touch.</p><p>His warmth.</p><p>His care.</p><p>His sweetness.</p><p>His love.</p><p>It all blended and melted into a bitter and painful memory of something he wanted more than anything, slowly forgetting as time flew by.</p><p>The first few months, Hokuto had wondered about Taiga's deadline and if he ended up meeting it, but when he checked the future release list ST Publishing put on their website, none of the novels ever had the name Kyomoto Taiga attached to it.</p><p>It was hard for Hokuto not to feel that he was to blame, but even so, all it did was add to the list of things Hokuto already blamed himself for, alongside items such as "ruining Taiga's ability to ever trust in love" and "destroying every last chance for Taiga to believe in love". The thought sank the heavy weight of guilt on his shoulders, but what more could it do when Hokuto was already completely crushed by it? </p><p>Just one more reason for Taiga to hate him could only add so much to make Hokuto hate himself even more.</p><p>The plastic dustpan clattered as Hokuto finished gathering what he could from the linoleum floors, glancing up at the click.</p><p>Another 4 hours, then he would work at the bar until 2 in the morning. Tomorrow, he had to wake at 6 to open Salut.</p><p>Hokuto could already feel his fatigue sink into his frame. </p><p>The store jingle played again as the doors gilded open, Hokuto forcing a grin as he bowed, fighting against his overworked body.</p><p>"Welcome in!"</p><p>Once the 4 hours of meticulous busy work was over, Hokuto scarfed down a discounted bento from the store before driving to the bar to work the evening shift.</p><p>"Your Manhattan, miss."</p><p>Hokuto spoke in a low tone, allowing himself to lean towards the woman as he smoothly placed the martini glass on the bar counter.</p><p>She was into him. He could tell. Out of all the seats at the bar she could have chosen, she selected the one right in front of where he worked.</p><p>As expected, the master wanted Hokuto to lay his charm on thick just as he did before, wooing and swaying customers with his words to drain as many drinks into them as he could. With the bonus attached, Hokuto had no reason not to…</p><p>"Thank you… It looks beautiful." She smiled, looking through her long lashes as took her drink. "Can I assume it would taste just as good as you?"</p><p>Hokuto stopped himself from flinching when she tapped her nails over his fingers, forcing sweet words from his lips with a smile. "... Maybe… What about sticking around to find out?"</p><p>… But after Taiga left, Hokuto could never quite do it the same.</p><p>Each time he told a woman she was beautiful or was lovely to speak with, it felt like a bold faced lie. It didn't matter if she was beautiful or not, all the words his tongue could form felt empty and heartless. </p><p>Maybe it was because he was finally tired of his sweetened lies, but maybe, it was because there was still the faded image of a person he truly found to be beautiful in his mind as he spoke. Even a small caress made his skin crawl, serving as a reminder of the touch that had once made his nerves spark and his heart race.</p><p>It was like he was cheating, though he was devoted to no one.</p><p>Well, maybe he was.</p><p>But that person didn't want him to be.</p><p>Hokuto wanted to collapse to the floor as soon as he reached his apartment after finally returning home at 2:21 am. His body was sore and tired and his clothes reeked of sweat and bourbon as he tore them off to stumble into the shower, but not without taking the bottle of whiskey he stole from the restaurant with him.</p><p>He was the one who ordered it. So he should be allowed to drink it.</p><p>The shower scalded his back and his scalp as he drank from the bottle, burning his insides at the same time and hoping it would swiftly bring him a rest that wouldn't last long enough.</p><p>And by the time he shut the water off, it was half empty.</p><p>His feet dragged as he ruffled his towel through his hair, eyes glazed and blurred as he tore open his bedside drawer for a box holding only scraps he had fished out from the garbage forever ago.</p><p>He emptied the contents onto his kitchen table, his fingers fumbling as pushed the pieces together to reform a word he would never hear from its writer's voice ever again.</p><p>The droplets from Hokuto's hair fell around it as his vision came to focus as the last two letters came together.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Thanks.</em>
</p><p>Somehow, even the period at the end charmed him.</p><p>Hokuto stared, hands planted on the table as he read the one word note over and over and over until it sounded like nothing.</p><p>"... I want to hear you…"</p><p>"I want to see you…"</p><p>The pieces crumpled as he clutched them in his hand as if they were him.</p><p>"I want to hold you……"</p><p>Touch him.</p><p>Love him.</p><p>But Taiga told him not to.</p><p>All Hokuto could do was comply and only dream of a person who slowly disappeared from his life.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"Hokuto."</p><p>"What."</p><p>"Hokuto!!"</p><p>"What!?!"</p><p>Hokuto swung around, hands still fumbling with the ever growing amount of order slips he tried to organize in the service window. "What is it, Shintaro?? Can't you see I'm trying to do something here??"</p><p>He didn't mean to snap at him, but no matter how many plates he delivered, the number of orders never seemed to shrink in size.</p><p>"I know, I know!! But listen to me–!!"</p><p>"Just say it already!!"</p><p>"I don't think we have enough stock to feed everyone!"</p><p>Hokuto froze, the issue with the order slips becoming microscopic in comparison as they nearly fell from his hands.</p><p>Salut had never seen so many customers.</p><p>No one in the staff had any clue or any time to find out the reason why.</p><p>It started around Wednesday when there seemed to be an unusual influx of customers. It was a pleasant surprise as it brought it more earnings, but by Friday, it had become unmanageable.</p><p>It wasn't extremely uncommon to see a line out the alley, but around the front and almost to the end of the block was completely unheard of. </p><p>They had already hesitantly increased stock Thursday night, unsure if it was just some fluke and that maybe other restaurants in the area had been closed, but by 4 pm today, it had become gravely apparent that it wasn't nearly enough. They had already tried their best, sending Shintaro to buy what he could find locally while Hokuto and Jesse tried to manage the floor and kitchen on their own, but the efforts were fruitless. As much as they wanted to serve all the customers who were willing to wait, their staff that worked perfectly for a small bistro was simply not strong enough to handle the rush of people who had hoped to have a meal before returning to work. </p><p>Hokuto slapped down the slips, speaking quickly as he hastily rummaged through the bar drawers to find a notepad and paper. "Start going down the line and asking if they want reservations for Monday. Only accept phone numbers, not emails." </p><p>As he shoved them into Shintaro's hands, he could already see the panic in the boy's eyes worsen.</p><p>"B-but, we've never done reservations before–!"</p><p>"We are now."</p><p>"What do I even–"</p><p>Before Shintaro could fully express his hesitation, knowing full well that reservations took much more than just a phone number, Hokuto was turning him and pushing out from behind the bar. </p><p>"Just do it! Don't make any promises! Apologize first and tell them we're working on it!!"</p><p>The additional stress was taking a toll on Hokuto's already overworked body. If he had been working on fumes before, now he was barely functioning on the wheezing gasps of what his energy bank had left. </p><p>He was barely able to give any time to the customers as he usually liked. As soon as an order was taken or a dish was delivered, he had to speed off to refill water or to seat another party. Deep inside, he was incredibly thankful as he was too physically and mentally drained to even try to make any flirtatious small talk, but he couldn't deny that he was surprised that none of the women who sat down didn't seem to mind.</p><p>Hokuto wasn't stupid enough to know that before today, besides the food, he was the main attraction.</p><p>But now, the women promptly made their order before returning to whispering between themselves, hardly paying him any mind.</p><p align="right">
  <em> "It really is exactly like it!" </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> "Besides the crowd, the atmosphere is really nice." </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> "The food is almost perfectly described! Hey, do you want to come back next week? I want to try the creme brulee!" </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> "What about the cherry clafoutis? There's no way it's as delicious as it sounded, right?" </em>
</p><p>Hokuto didn't have the time to process the gossip stirring around him as he weaved table to table, trying to finish the last of the orders they were able to fulfill while bowing and apologizing for unavailable dishes before tempting them with what they could provide. With the combined efforts of his quick work and Shintaro turning away customers at the door, what was left of the crowd was worked away, filling their stomachs as they left happily, regardless of if it was full of what they came for.</p><p>Jesse threw himself over the bar, dirtied with food and utterly exhausted after Shintaro locked the door and flipped the closed sign over with a handwritten note hanging from the bottom. </p><p align="center">
  <em> Due to shortage of stock.  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Please return tomorrow. </em>
</p><p>"... If this happens again next week, I might just die," Jesse groaned into the wooden counter.</p><p>"You can't die," Hokuto replied tersely, his mind busied with trying to comprehend just how much their income had spiked the last few days. "You'll make Kochi cry."</p><p>Jesse responded with another tired groan as he sank into his stool.</p><p>The loud clang of Shintaro's just emptied and oversized water bottle made both of them flinch as he slammed the metal bottom into the table with an exaggerated sigh from draining its contents into his stomach.</p><p>Hokuto and Jesse had expected a joke.</p><p>But Shintaro had always been surprisingly serious when it came to work.</p><p>"Seriously." He huffed.</p><p>"We need more staff."</p><p>Both Hokuto and Jesse agreed, Hokuto giving a nod as Jesse's shoulders slumped in defeat, pulling his phone from his pocket.</p><p>Jesse flicked his thumb, scrolling through his contacts with his head still resting against the table top. "I'll see if I can find someone for next week. Even if it's just temporary."</p><p>"Thanks, Jess." Hokuto sighed as he closed the register. "I think I'm going to go get some rest before work tomorrow."</p><p>"Huh??"</p><p>Shintaro leaned over the counter, his brow furrowed and mouth open in disgruntled shock. "Are you seriously going to still work part time tomorrow!?! You'll turn to dust if you go in!! If Jesse gets one more body and you're nothing but sand, we'll be back at a body count of 3! And if I know math, that's not an improvement!"</p><p>Hokuto let himself laugh a little, though even the bit of joy made his body ache. </p><p>"With the extra sleep, I should be able to do just fine by Monday. The extra hands will be a huge help as well," he said as he rubbed his sore neck. "It would also be great if you could call back those numbers." </p><p>As much as Shintaro wanted to complain and say no, he wasn't ignorant enough to know just how hard Hokuto had been working. The most he could do was give up part of his pay without prying into Hokuto's private life.</p><p>If calling numbers all weekend could help to alleviate Hokuto's stress just the barest bit, then Shintaro would do it.</p><p>"... Okay."</p><p>Hokuto sighed, knowing that Shintaro was accepting it begrudgingly. Shintaro was always easy to read, no matter how much he tried to hide it.</p><p>"I really appreciate it."</p><p>"Yeah yeah." Shintaro waved his hand as he took and chuckled the number filled notebook on top of his bag. </p><p>"Just seeing you smile a little makes it worth it."</p><p>Hokuto blinked as Shintaro stretched and Jesse sat up, propping himself up with his elbows.</p><p>"Before you ask," Jesse cut in with a smile, looking a little revived after his break over the bar counter. "No, you haven't been smiling as much. And yes, we care."</p><p>"Just take care of yourself, Hokuto." Jesse chuckled, still cheerful though his body was beaten and tried. "We're just happy to have you lean on us a little."</p><p>Hokuto just stared at them, a lump nearly growing in his throat before he swallowed it down.</p><p>Jeez…</p><p>… Since when did he have such great friends?</p><p>As he smiled, Hokuto realized how long it had been since he had used those muscles. Even the service smile he gave when he worked didn't feel the same as when his teeth showed as he laughed.</p><p>"Thanks, you two…"</p><p>"Now let's clean up so we can get out of here."</p><p>The first thing Hokuto did when he got back to his room was eat.</p><p>Because only God knew just how much he needed it.</p><p>He hadn't been able to cook himself a proper meal in ages instead of swallowing down what scraps there were from the bar or Salut. Not even the discounted meals from the convenience store could compare to finally sitting down and taking time to eat.</p><p>He prepared his food like a ritual, carefully cleaning and washing fresh produce then cutting and chopping them steadily before listening to his stove flicker and come to life.</p><p>All he prepared was a simple stir-fry with white rice, but the grain had never tasted so good.</p><p>Hokuto ate, crunching down on a bell pepper, finally having the time to appreciate and enjoy its sweetness and the taste of sesame oil before washing it down with the round and full taste of rice as he filled his own stomach for once. </p><p>For the first time since that night, the weight on his chest seemed to lighten, if not only for a moment as he ate in silence.</p><p>It felt great.</p><p>It felt like… he could finally take the first step towards moving on.</p><p>It was like the world was giving him a chance to turn everything around, that he could finally enjoy himself again. He had a business that was growing and friends who cared about him. </p><p>It had been 3 years… </p><p>It was about time to finally forgive himself.</p><p>To finally forget.</p><p>To finally let go.</p><p>Hokuto cleared his plate, the scraps of the note still laid out on his table across from him, as if Taiga was there himself, smiling as he ate his food, humming in glee from their shared meal.</p><p align="center">
  <em> "It tastes good." </em>
</p><p>Hokuto could barely remember how his voice sounded when he had said it, but he would always remember the words said after he had carefully cooked and crafted the dish for him.</p><p>His chopsticks clicked against his plate as he ate the last broccoli.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>… Maybe it was time to let the words go too.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>The image of Taiga began to disappear as Hokuto finished every last grain from his bowl, standing up and setting his dishes away to be handled tomorrow. After a shower and clearing the table, he laid down for a sleep that would only last for a couple hours. </p><p>In the night's silence, Hokuto gazed at his dark ceiling before closing his eyes.</p><p>The torn up pieces of Taiga's note lay scattered at the bottom of his trash.</p><p>This was the first of many.</p><p>The first of many steps to finally forgetting Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>"Aww shoot!"</p><p>"Hmm? What's wrong?"</p><p>"I didn't bring my umbrella…"</p><p>The girl giggled alongside her coworker as they restocked the magazines on the shelf.</p><p>"Just buy one from here, silly. Or I can go with you to Donki later."</p><p>"Really??" The other smiled with glee, throwing her arms around her friend. "Thank you!! This is why you're the best!!"</p><p>Hokuto glanced over to see the two girls cuddling up together, laughing and not really getting their work done.</p><p>He wasn't surprised. </p><p>This is how most days went at the convenience store. </p><p>It wasn't like the company was really paying him enough to care if one or two idol magazines didn't make it on the shelf in time for their fan to pick it up at that very moment. He wasn't the manager and he wasn't willing to do anything that was outside of his pay range.</p><p>His gaze fell back down to the sketch of Salut's floor plan he had drawn into the notebook laid out on the checkout counter. </p><p>He was considering reorganizing the seating layout. </p><p>With the expectations of reservation, Hokuto pondered whether it would help to reorient the tables to distinguish which were saved seats and which were open seating to keep them from accidentally overlapping. </p><p>He had jotted down the number of tables of chairs as he drew lines and boxes to mimic their placement, running mental scenarios to find what would best maintain their organization and efficiency.</p><p>It was nice to have a focus. </p><p>With his work, there was a particular haze that began to dissipate from his mind as he let himself bring his attention back to what mattered in his life. His work and his craft.</p><p>That's what he came to the city for in the first place. </p><p>It wasn't to find someone or to find love. </p><p>His passion was what mattered the most.</p><p>He couldn't waste his life away.</p><p>He couldn't burn his days away thinking and wondering, wishing for and dreaming of what he could have had with–</p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga?..."</p><p>"Ah! He's the one with the new book last week, right?"</p><p>Despite his own words, just his name took out all the air from Hokuto's chest.</p><p>Immediately, his head snapped up, his eyes looking at his coworkers who mentioned that name before jumping to the TV above him that they were watching.</p><p>Hokuto could feel his mouth go dry.</p><p>… How?...</p><p>How was it when he was just ready to forget him, he appeared before him like a vision that didn't feel real?...</p><p>He felt so far, but so close as even the outdated TV projected his image over the tiny screen.</p><p>Despite all of that, Taiga was as beautiful as ever...</p><p>… No, he took that back.</p><p>Taiga was more stunning than Hokuto could have ever imagined.</p><p>Hokuto had already fallen in love with the disheveled Taiga that only ever wore t-shirts and athletic pants that emerged from his nights writing, but with his blonde hair swept back neatly into place and a perfectly fitted suit that framed and accentuated his slender figure, Hokuto found himself breathless.</p><p>Every detail Hokuto could see made his chest tighten, from the dark fade that peeked out from under his smooth hair to the silver watch placed on his wrist, and as Taiga raised his head after bowing graciously to the interviewer across from him, accepting the seat offered to him, Hokuto wasn't even aware of his own words that slipped from his lips.</p><p>"... He's not wearing his glasses…"</p><p>Thank God, no one came into the store at this time, because all Hokuto could do was stare as his heart raced. </p><p>Pounding and throbbing, already falling in love with him again.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Is this your first time appearing on our show?" </em>

    <em> Taiga laughed, bowing his head again. "Yes, my first time on TV actually, so please excuse me for being a little nervous." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "No, not at all! We're just thankful that you agreed to speak with us." </em>
  </p>

  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Yes, I–" </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>As the interview went on, Hokuto stared as every blurred and faded memory of Taiga came flooding back with a clarity as clear as the day Hokuto had tried to engrain them into his mind.</p><p>He stared, reminded, remembering, every single thing that made his pulse rush and his heart ache.</p><p>His gentle voice.</p><p>His clear eyes.</p><p>His small smile. </p><p>Hokuto remembered everything, from the way he cried in his arms to the way Taiga gazed at him after their kiss broke before he had promised him his everything.</p><p>His sadness.</p><p>His happiness.</p><p>His love.</p><p>Hokuto's fingers tightened, not realizing how they creased the pages in his notebook as he watched.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "At the end of your book…" the interviewer asked as she flipped through her cards, "I don't want to spoil it, but readers have been saying there isn't quite an ending." </em>

  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga smiled politely. "Is there not?... I thought I had ended it quite well." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer waved her hands in panic. "No! My apologies, I don't mean an ending. I guess it would be better said that there wasn't much clarity with the relationship. Your book isn't labeled as a romance, but many others with me included, found it to be rather romantic." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga laughed. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Hokuto hadn't realized how much he had missed the sound of it.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "... Well… I didn't label it as a romance for a reason." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer tilted her head questioningly. "Could you explain?" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "I didn't label it as a romance because I don't think it needs to be." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga leaned back in his chair, smiling once seeing his interviewer's confused expression. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Even if the woman across from Taiga didn't notice, Hokuto immediately saw how Taiga's folded hands tightened in his lap.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "That's not to say that those who believe it to be romantic are wrong, they're allowed to read it that way, but that is precisely the reason why. I left the relationship in the book open because I want it to resonate with people whichever way they wish to read it, romantic or not." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "What the characters do and how they act are led by how they feel, whether it's romantic or platonic doesn't matter. It could even be a mix of both, but what matters is that it's understood that there is an affection between them beyond vocalized words." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer perked up as she shifted in her seat. "Is this also why you made both of the characters men?" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Well, wouldn't it be strange for a man to be writing about the experience of two women?" Taiga chuckled, crossing his legs. "I don't mean to invalidate your question. I understand why there's some curiosity in the gender choice and it relates back to what I mentioned before." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Oftentimes in media and entertainment, regardless of the intention, any sort of attention or care between opposite genders is perceived as romantic. I wanted to eliminate those presumptions and have the focus be on their actions and not on whether they're a man or a woman." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer smiled, immersed in Taiga's words. "... That's wonderful. You mentioned action over words… Could I ask you about that?" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Of course." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "There isn't much dialogue in your book… and as you had mentioned yourself, it's what the characters do that speaks for them. Could I ask you what inspired you to write with this focus?" </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>There was a second of hesitation where Taiga looked as if he was lost in thought, but it was quickly covered by a smile and a nod.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Um… Yes." </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>His lips parted, closed, before opening again as Taiga carefully selected which words to say. </p><p>As his voice came through the tinny TV speakers, Hokuto forgot how to breathe.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Someone… once told me that food speaks…" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga looked down at his lap, laughing to himself before he raised his head to continue. "After years of writer's block, that was the first thing that intrigued me. A language I wanted to know, but didn't understand." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Is this why one of the characters cooks?" She asked. </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga nodded. "That's correct. That's where it started, but it grew from there." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Language and meanings that live beyond words… just because words like 'I love you' aren't said, it doesn't mean that they aren't felt."  </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "A mother doesn't have to tell her child everyday that she loves them for him to know. From the way she packs his meals or the way she makes his bed before he returns home can mean plenty enough on its own." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Things like remembering someone's birthday or noticing their hobbies can speak a thousand words by itself. Supporting their passions, taking time to learn about them. To understand them." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Cooking for them. Making them laugh when they cry." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Talking. Being there." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Giving them your time..." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga paused as he inhaled. </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "... I think… these kinds of things can speak louder than words…"  </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> He blinked, his eyes that had begun to wander refocusing on his talk partner as he laughed.  </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "... Don't you think so?..." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> She chuckled and nodded. "If I didn't agree before, you've certainly convinced me."  </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Taiga chuckled with her. "I got carried away, but in short, it was from a conversation I had with someone once." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer crossed her arms, her notes abandoned.  </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "It sounds like they were quite fascinating to have inspired you so much after such a long block." </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Hokuto's fists clenched against the counter before they could begin to tremble, remembering the way Taiga had shoved his spoon into his mousse, demanding him to teach him to cook as Hokuto watched his eyes soften from the screen.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "... Yes…" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "They certainly were interesting." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> The interviewer placed down the notes in her lap as she glanced at the queue card behind the camera. "We're about out of time, but before we end, do you mind if I ask one more thing?" </em>

  <p align="right">
    <em> "Sure." </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "Have you been able to thank that person?" </em>
  </p>

  <p align="right">
    <em> "No…" </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> "I'm not sure if they would even speak to me." </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>When the door chime sang, piercing through Hokuto's mind as it greeted a customer, Hokuto nearly gasped as he was shaken back to reality.</p><p>He tore his eyes from the screen to bow with a smile, welcoming the man in as his heart pounded in his chest before clasping a hand over his mouth as soon as his back was turned.</p><p>He tried to steady his hands as his head spun and his stomach churned, sucking air back into his starved lungs.</p><p>He wanted to throw up. </p><p>He felt sick.</p><p>Just last night, he was ready. He was ready to let it all go, to let all of Taiga go. </p><p>He was ready to let it all disappear as nothing, just a blip in his life's timeline as he finally continued forward, never again thinking again of the person who had changed his life's course, who made him <em> want </em>to change its course.</p><p>Time could make his voice and his eyes fade away, even his touch, his kiss and his embrace.</p><p>But time could never let him forget how they made Hokuto feel.</p><p>Hokuto could never forget how his words overwhelmed him or how his eyes entranced him, or the way his heart sank when he was with Juri and how it sang when they kissed. How blissful it was to hold him in his arms, perfectly curled against his chest as treasured every second with his warmth, yearning for the day that maybe, Taiga would tell him that his kiss meant <em> something </em>.</p><p>He could never forget him. He would never forget him.</p><p>It was foolish to think he ever could.</p><p>Hokuto plastered on a smile as the man came to the counter with an energy drink and a packaged sandwich. He tried to keep his hands from stumbling over the items as he scanned them, forcing his mind to have enough clarity to count and sort the man's change, and as soon as the door jingle played again as it shut, Hokuto breathed, closing his notebook and its plans. </p><p>He paused, staring at the cream colored floors before raising his head back up to the TV where Taiga was now gone from the midday reports and replaced by the news, but his words still lingered in Hokuto's mind. </p><p>… Taiga had said that he wasn't sure if that person would even speak to him… It wasn't wrong to think that he spoke of him, was it?</p><p>Unless there was some other person who had taught him about food in the last 3 years, which wasn't entirely impossible, because it didn't make sense.</p><p>Taiga was the one who had told him to never see him again. Why would Taiga think that he wouldn't want to speak to him? </p><p>Of course, he wanted to speak to him.</p><p>He wanted so much more than just to speak with him.</p><p>Hokuto wanted everything…. As long as it was Taiga.</p><p>Hokuto's jaw clenched as his gaze dropped to the store shelves, filled with the stale white light.</p><p>It wasn't like he could do anything anyways. </p><p>All he could do was wonder.</p><p>"Have you read his book?" One of the girls whispered, flipping through a magazine as the other shook her head.</p><p>"No, but my mom bought it. She said she couldn't put it down, my dad almost got mad," she laughed.</p><p>"I think my sister said he's having a book signing today… I think she's already–"</p><p>Both of them jumped when the broom and the dustpan behind the counter clattered to the floor.</p><p>But what scared them more was the intensity in Hokuto's eyes as he spoke, leaning over the counter and anxious for their answer.</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"When?"</p><p>One of them stammered, finding it hard to look Hokuto in the eye as she answered.</p><p>"U-um… I didn't ask, so I'm not sure… I-it's probably sometime around now–"</p><p>Hokuto was already unbuttoning his uniform.</p><p>"That's good enough. Thanks."</p><p>They just stared in shock as Hokuto disappeared into the backroom to return with his bag.</p><p>"Can you two do me a huge favor?" He asked as he threw it over his shoulder, typing rapidly into his phone. </p><p>The two glanced at each other, the still yet to be sorted magazines clutched in their hands. </p><p>"It depends," one replied, building enough bravery to answer for the both of them. "What's in it for us?"</p><p>"Just cover my shift and I'll give you my week's salary. If anything comes up, just call the supervisor." Hokuto said, his eyes still down on his phone.</p><p>"Deal."</p><p>"Um… Matsumura?..."</p><p>When Hokuto looked up, he saw the other girl hiding behind her friend's shoulder as she peered at him with worried and scared eyes. </p><p>He apologized internally as he felt his phone vibrate in his hand, giving a reassuring smile as he opened the counter panel to step out.</p><p>"Yes?..."</p><p>"Are you a fan of Kyomoto's books?"</p><p>Hokuto glanced down at his phone, seeing he got the reply he wanted.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em> J District. Ends in 30 minutes.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em> Unless you're a block away</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em> Run.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>"... I am…" Hokuto replied.</p><p>"I love them a lot."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The pen squeaked as it drew its tip over the inner cover, leaving curls and curves over the paper before it pulled away with a sharp line.</p><p>"Thank you for coming," Taiga said with a smile as the woman nodded, hiding her rosy cheeks behind the newly signed book.</p><p>"Um… Kyomoto? Can I ask something?"</p><p>Taiga raised his head as he capped his pen. "Sure."</p><p>"H-how many times have you… been in love?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>He blinked as his smile turned crooked, shocked at the question while she bowed in apology. "Uh... Why do you ask?..."</p><p>The book moved higher over her face. "I-I was just– um–..."</p><p>"... Once."</p><p>The cover moved down just enough for her to peek over the top as Taiga repeated his answer with a soft laugh.</p><p>"Just once… Is that all?"</p><p>She nodded, thanking him profusely before scurrying off as security directed another person to approach his table. </p><p>Hokuto couldn't really hear the conversation, but even if he could, he was too busy trying to pretend that he wasn't even there.</p><p>It wasn't that there were no other men in line, it was fairly well mixed, but there were few enough for Hokuto to receive glances from around him. It didn't exactly help that as soon as he tried to run into the line, he was pulled out by security who told him he needed to have a book with him.</p><p>He stood out like a sore thumb.</p><p>He really wished he could disappear.</p><p>Over the years, Hokuto had been able to build a false wall of confidence when it came to service, but when it came to him participating in the general public, he never wanted to attract more eyes than a normal person should. He even frequently wore masks and hats to cover himself when it came to shopping by himself or just taking a stroll.</p><p>But unfortunately, as things were, it was rather hard for him to blend in. </p><p>He was happy to finally be close to the front of the line, but just the split second view of Taiga's blonde hair over the shifting of moving heads made Hokuto's blood rush with anxiety and doubt.</p><p>What if Taiga didn't mean him?</p><p>What if Taiga was speaking of someone else?</p><p>What if in the past 3 years, he <em> had </em>someone else?</p><p>What would Taiga say?</p><p>What would Taiga do?</p><p>Would Taiga even let him speak to him, or even come near him?</p><p>What would Hokuto say?</p><p>What could he say?</p><p>The sick feeling came back as his throat grew tight.</p><p>Hokuto didn't know.</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>But as soon as Taiga's eyes met his as Hokuto soon just before the front of the line, it didn't matter. </p><p>Taiga stared, locked in disbelief before his eyes stuttered over to the woman that approached him as he smiled and apologized. Once she was finished, Taiga glanced at him again as the pair in front of Hokuto went to the table, leaving him at the front of the line.</p><p>As long as Taiga didn't call security to throw him out, Hokuto had to at least try.</p><p>The staff directed Hokuto to walk forward.</p><p>A language beyond words…</p><p>… Hokuto just hoped Taiga would understand.</p><p>"... Your name?"</p><p>Hokuto placed the book he had never opened in Taiga's outstretched hand.</p><p>"... Matsumura Hokuto."</p><p>The untouched cover creaked as Taiga opened it and uncapped his pen. "... Pardon me for asking but…" </p><p>The dark ink sank into the fresh page as Taiga drew his signature.</p><p>"... Have you read my book yet?..."</p><p>Hokuto couldn't lie.</p><p>He swore he wouldn't, after all.</p><p>"... No."</p><p>"Then, can I ask why you're here?"</p><p>When Taiga looked up at him, Hokuto lost every word he could have prepared from his lips.</p><p>Years of flirting and weighted compliments were reduced to nothing when Hokuto was once again faced with Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p>Because Kyomoto Taiga was never just someone to play with.</p><p>Kyomoto Taiga had always meant something.</p><p><em> Everything </em>.</p><p>Hokuto's throat grew dry as he finally got himself to speak.</p><p>"... I…"</p><p>"... I was wondering if I could make you dinner."</p><p>Taiga handed him back the book, a new crease pressed into its spine as Hokuto smoothly pulled it from his grip.</p><p>"... Why?"</p><p>Neither of them heard the staff telling them it was time to move on to the next person.</p><p>As the corner left his fingers, Taiga looked up to meet Hokuto's eyes. "... What will happen if I go?" </p><p>"... I don't know…"</p><p>Taiga wasn't wearing his glasses.</p><p>Even after 3 years, his eyes were just as breathtaking as the day Hokuto first saw them over those thick frames.</p><p>Hokuto forced his tongue to work, his heart pounding in his ears as he nearly saw his reflection in Taiga's clear eyes.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"... I was hoping you would be my boyfriend after."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>"... Hoku–"</p><p>"I'm sorry, sir. There's a line that we need to finish at the top of the hour, so if you could-"</p><p>A staff member gently pushed Hokuto's shoulder, attempting to encourage the moment of his feet towards the exit, but Hokuto's eyes didn't leave Taiga's and Taiga's didn't leave his.</p><p>"I'll wait. At the restaurant." </p><p>Hokuto spoke, the staff pushing him again. </p><p>"Sir–"</p><p>His feet stumbled as he was pulled away.</p><p>"I'll wait."</p><p>"I'll wait– I promise-"</p><p>It had been so long since Hokuto had felt so lost when Taiga's eyes left his to the new person standing before his table.</p><p>He'd wait.</p><p>And wait.</p><p>Hoping that Taiga would come and give him a chance he didn't deserve.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was pouring.</p><p>Hokuto had remembered to ask the bar for the day off, but he had forgotten about the weather report from the morning as he did exactly what he said he would do once he returned home.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>Salut was closed and Hokuto waited outside, not wanting to take a chance on missing the unlikely possibility that Taiga would arrive.</p><p>It didn't matter if it was unlikely or not. He had said he would wait and he intended to keep that promise, whether it mattered to Taiga or not.</p><p>So he waited.</p><p>Even as the rain started and even as people stared at him as they passed, he waited. The ledge of the building kept him dry for a while, but the rain soon over took his shelter, soaking his shoes and below his knees. Still, Hokuto waited, scared that Taiga would come and turn away the moment he went inside for an umbrella.</p><p>The hot summer rain slowly drenched his clothes.</p><p>The sky grew dark and the sun fell beneath the horizon.</p><p>Hokuto stood, waiting, powered only by the glimmer of a hope that Taiga would come.</p><p>He checked his phone.</p><p>8:21 pm.</p><p>It had been about 6 hours since Taiga left his sight… but 6 hours felt like nothing compared to 3 years. </p><p>If Taiga arrived, then it would make it all worth it.</p><p>Just for a chance.</p><p>A chance that he could hold him again, protect his heart, and finally have a chance to tell him he loves him, even if Taiga was just</p><p>going to tell him he couldn't love him back.</p><p>The day wasn't over. There were still 3 and half hours left. It was 3 and half more hours Taiga could still come to him.</p><p>People stopped passing by and the street grew quiet. Not too long after, there was only the flow of the street lights that flickered on and the storefront signs to keep him company.</p><p>Hokuto's foot slipped as he sank to the ground.</p><p>He was already almost completely soaked. There was no reason for him to not let the rain have the rest.</p><p>The rain soaked into his hair and fell against his cheek as he took out his phone to tap the screen, droplets collecting on the glass.</p><p>10:34 pm.</p><p>He stared at the number as the rain rolled down along his chin before he wrapped his arms around his knees, dropping his head into his lap.</p><p>He hated how he knew there was a limit.</p><p>If he could, he would wait forever, but he had to accept he was only human. His body could only last for so long before he would collapse.</p><p>He watched the silver of the view of his phone from between his knees where he had placed it on the concrete pavement.</p><p>10:35 pm.</p><p>Hokuto ignored the whine of his stomach and the shiver down his spine.</p><p>He wanted so badly to go back to the time when he was warm with Taiga in his arms.</p><p>11:12 pm.</p><p>The rain started to let up, but that was the only grace Hokuto was given.</p><p>11:56 pm.</p><p>If it weren't for the cold and horrible weight of his soaked clothes, Hokuto could have easily fallen asleep.</p><p>While the rest he had the night before was plentiful respite, it wasn't nearly enough to keep him awake for much longer.</p><p>Hokuto closed his eyes.</p><p>When they opened, the time on his phone seemed to mock him.</p><p>
  <br/>

  <br/>
</p><p>00:04 flipped to 00:05 am.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Hokuto's mind was blank.</p><p>… Three years.</p><p>After 3 years, Hokuto saw him again. He had even spoken to him.</p><p>… And for what?...</p><p>Just a reminder that he could never move on?...</p><p>Sick.</p><p>The world was twisted and sick.</p><p>Hokuto closed his eyes, his head heavy and his body and fingers ice cold.</p><p>But maybe this was his bliss.</p><p>To see Taiga just one last time.</p><p>To be in love with him one last time.</p><p>Hokuto could feel his consciousness slipping as his head lulled.</p><p>He felt the rain stop.</p><p>Maybe that was a sign.</p><p>Hokuto looked up, expecting to be blinded by the street light that had always been there to greet him, but he only saw black.</p><p>An umbrella.</p><p>Hokuto felt like he was hallucinating.</p><p>

    <p>Chapter End Notes</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>HAAA Somehow I was able to post this one within a week!! I guess things got pretty exciting so I got a little more motivated to burn through editing this one! The past ones had taken a lot of editing and for some reason, this one didn't take as much. In some ways, I wish I had taken a little more time with it, but I tend to be a little temperamental with my own writing. One day, it could be perfect and another day, it feels stale as old bread haha. So I'm just choosing this one to fly as it is, regardless if it has the real punch I wanted it to have.</p><p>Its been 3 years!! The last chapter had a lot happening and we've slowed down to a complete stop again in some ways! But as some of you have guessed, we're really reaching the end here. I've decided to finally list the final amount of chapters as well. Next chapter won't exactly be the end, but it will be the step right before it! I feel like the format of the next chapters will be rather unexpected... or perhaps is perfectly predictable! We will have to see!!</p><p>As for WIPs... I've mentioned the alternate chapter for With You before, and to be honest, I've completely dropped it and left it behind haha. I think I will look at it again one day, but right now its not really at the forefront of things I want to write. I think once I have some time, I want to write that part 2-3 for the When The Heart Speaks series. I want to wrap up both kyomohoku and yugoje's stories a little more hehe. Other than that, I've been itching to write some smut again. I feel like the theme I'm going with this time is crossdressing, but I'm tempted to be a little unique with it. I'll just have to see where my mind takes me!</p><p>As usual, I would love to hear what people think as we're closing in on the ending!! Has this been going at all how you imagined it from chapter 1? It feels like it was already so long ago. It's amazing I started making notes on this in July last year! It's almost a year old and I haven't finished posting it yet!!!!! I hope my next long fic will be a bit faster...</p><p>I have a Twitter! The app has been rather strange lately, but I'm still staying there until it burns down! I will still be posting fic updates and fic previews as usual! My DMs are also open if you just want chat or if you have any questions! I love talking to people about whatever!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p></blockquote>

  <p>It wasn't going well.</p><p>Of course, it wasn't going well.</p><p>No one could write when they were in complete emotional turmoil. Only freaks and insane people could manage to bring themselves to be creative.</p><p>Even if Taiga were to admit that he was a bit out of his mind, there was simply no way he could bring himself to write.</p><p>After he had walked away from that bridge, away from Hokuto, he completely broke down.</p><p>The tears hadn't come immediately. He could only assume that it was because the shock hadn't settled as a rage still stirred in his stomach, but after making it 4 blocks down the street, reality came, hitting him like a truck.</p><p>Hot angry tears had instantly flooded his eyes, blinding him and forcing his feet to come to a stop.</p><p>"Fuck…"</p><p>Taiga gritted his teeth, his curse hissing through them as he shoved his sleeved palms against his eyes.</p><p>He couldn't stop crying.</p><p>"<b><em>Fuck</em> </b>–...!!!"</p><p>Fuck him.</p><p>Fuck Hokuto.</p><p>Fuck this.</p><p>Fuck love.</p><p>Fuck romance.</p><p>Fuck <em> all </em> of it.</p><p>He didn't need it.</p><p>It was worthless.</p><p>He hated it.</p><p>If he hated it before, he hated it even more now.</p><p>Love was worth nothing.</p><p>Taiga was right all along.</p><p>Love was just a cheap trick.</p><p>Cheap words. Meaningless action. Just a manipulative tool and empty promises of devotion to make someone believe that another could actually tear themselves apart just so that they would stay beside them. Thinking that they cared. That they loved them. That they were worth something.</p><p>It was <em> never </em> anything.</p><p>And Hokuto was the same.</p><p>Taiga choked on his tears, doubling over in the empty street as his hands clutched into his clothes, wishing it could ease the anger that burned in his throat.</p><p>Hokuto lied.</p><p>He used him.</p><p>He pushed himself into his life and spoke to him about the bullshit called romance.</p><p>Hokuto acted like he cared. Like Taiga was different.</p><p>He chased him. He held him.</p><p>He <em> promised</em>.</p><p>The worst part wasn't that all Hokuto wanted was money or even that one of his best friends was in on the bet as well.</p><p>The worst part of all of it was that Taiga believed him. That he wanted to believe him. That he even <em> convinced </em> himself to believe him.</p><p>That he had fallen, only to be told that he never understood and that he never would understand.</p><p>That it would always be nothing.</p><p>If Kochi had never miraculously texted him to ask about a reference, Taiga wasn't sure how he would have made it home.</p><p>Kochi couldn't bring himself to say no when he had heard the shaking in Taiga's voice, asking to be picked up.</p><p>When Taiga got in the car, his face was stained with tears, eyes and nose swollen from abuse. Tears still fell, but everything had turned numb, both his body and his mind, tired of painstakingly repeating words and memories that only wallowed him in despair and regrets.</p><p>Kochi only snuck glances as Taiga just let the spare tears roll down his cheeks.</p><p>"... I… I'm assuming you don't want to talk about it," Kochi said once he had convinced himself it was at least worth asking.</p><p>"... No... I don't."</p><p>Kochi focused back on the road. "... I didn't think so…"</p><p>Taiga wiped off the tears that fell from the bottom of his chin.</p><p>"... Just never talk to me about Matsumura Hokuto ever again."</p><p>Once Taiga got home, all he could bring himself to do was sleep.</p><p>He didn't eat or shower or work. He just slept since sleeping was the only thing that would make his brain shut the hell up. All his waking moments were only flooded with thoughts that only made him hate himself more than he already did.</p><p>The drifting images of Hokuto's ghost in his home only made the hatred sink deeper.</p><p>He needed to despise him.</p><p>Not wish that he was there.</p><p>The first time Taiga had gotten up to do anything more than swallow down an instant noodle to appease his whining stomach, was to answer the knocking on the door that wouldn't stop. All the other knocks were stopped with a text of "leave me alone", "I'm fine. Just go home", or "I don't care. Let them fire me", but this one persisted.</p><p>Wishing only to be allowed to sleep again, Taiga took his covers with him to unlock the door to peek through the crack.</p><p>He immediately slammed it back shut once seeing who was behind it.</p><p>"Kyomo..." Juri tried to call through the door with his forehead pressed against the smooth surface. "I read your text, but you know I can't just leave you alone. Not even because of work…"</p><p>"... As a friend."</p><p>He knocked again.</p><p>"Please let me explain."</p><p>"I never meant to hurt you. You know I would never try to hurt you."</p><p>"Please. Just 5 minutes. That's all I ask."</p><p>Taiga wanted so badly to just curl back in his bed.</p><p>He clutched his head, trying to keep Juri's voice from blurring into Hokuto's from that night.</p><p>He wasn't ready to forgive him. He didn't want to forgive him.</p><p>… But Taiga wanted to burn bridges and there was still one last rope that needed to be cut.</p><p>Taiga grimaced as he tightened his blanket around himself before knocking on the other side of the door, bringing Juri to press an ear against the wood.</p><p>"... Matsumura has my key…"</p><p>Juri heard Taiga's voice from the other side.</p><p>"... Bring it back."</p><p>"Then I'll give you 5."</p><p>It only took 2 hours for Juri to return, the key gleaming in the hallway lights as he held it up to the peephole for Taiga to see his payment.</p><p>Taiga begrudgingly opened the door, pushing it open and ready to snap at him that he wouldn't be taking any of his shit excuses, but before he could even begin to speak, Juri's forehead was to the floor before his feet in dogeza.</p><p>"Juri-"</p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga," Juri spoke into Taiga's entryway. "In my most deepest and sincere apology, I am sorry for what I have done."</p><p>Taiga pulled his blanket around himself as he watched Juri at his feet.</p><p>… While he felt he deserved it, seeing him like this felt shameful.</p><p>"What I did was wrong," Juri continued. "What I did was terrible and I cannot bear to face you and lie to you that I was not responsible. I take complete and utter responsibility for what I have done and I cannot blame anyone for my actions except myself."</p><p>"You deserve better."</p><p>"You deserve someone you can trust and believe only has your best intentions in mind. I believed myself to be that person, but I had crossed a line I should have never considered."</p><p>"I confess that I had made a deal with Matsumura Hokuto regarding the completion of a romance novel for monetary value. While this is true, in my deepest sincerity, all I ever hoped for him to do was to share his insight as a way to help you. I would have never expected for him to behave this way. The intention of the bet was never made on your feelings, only as a way for you to learn. It is your own will whether you choose to believe me or not or to ever trust me again, but I only wish to be truthful with you from now and from now on."</p><p>"Again, it is my heaviest of regrets that my actions caused you pain. I will understand if you never wish to speak to me again. I will personally discuss with the company about my work with you and will bear all blame."</p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga, I am deeply, <em> deeply </em> and incredibly-"</p><p>Juri nearly bit his tongue when Taiga's foot was suddenly shoved at his shoulder. He grunted as he was toppled over before the same foot planted into his stomach, forcing the wind out from his lungs.</p><p>He coughed but smiled as Taiga dropped down beside him.</p><p>"..... Do you forgive me?"</p><p>"... Let me hit you."</p><p>"As you wish. Just not the face."</p><p>Taiga reeled back his fist, his blanket slipping from his shoulders before dropping the flat of it hard into Juri's suit-covered core, making him clench his teeth and lurch in pain.</p><p>"Oof! Wait–! Kyomo! Ow–"</p><p>He did it again and again, whacking his first into Juri's stomach and sides, enough to hurt, but not enough to damage muscle.</p><p>Punching Juri's soft spots, that were actually only skin and bones, was cathartic. It let Taiga take his anger and frustration out on him as he watched Juri lurch and curl in pain.</p><p>It felt good to hurt him.</p><p>But at the same time, as his anger was released, it only dragged back up the numbed ache with it.</p><p>"Ow–!! Wait, Kyomo! That one actually really hurt!!"</p><p>Taiga had dug both of his fists into Juri's flat stomach, crushing his insides. Juri tapped at his shoulder, asking for an out, before coughing as Taiga's weight fell over him.</p><p>The punishment stopped, but only because it no longer made Taiga feel any better.</p><p>The room fell silent as Taiga pulled his blanket over himself, curling into the rise and fall of Juri's center, letting Juri lay his hand over where he presumed Taiga's head to be under the blanketed lump.</p><p>"Kyomo…" he said softly as he watched the white ceiling.</p><p>"I really am sorry…"</p><p>A quiet muffled voice spoke back.</p><p>"... I know..."</p><p>"Will you forgive me?..."</p><p>"... Not yet... but eventually..."</p><p>"I'll wait as long as it takes…"</p><p>The two of them stayed like this, both on the floor just feet away from the entryway as Juri gently patted and rubbed Taiga's head and back in silence.</p><p>Taiga didn't know at what point he had fallen asleep, but when he raised his head from his nest over Juri's middle, he found his pillow to be dead asleep.</p><p>Juri had always been able to fall asleep in the strangest places. Even on a cold hardwood floor wearing a full three piece suit…</p><p>Taiga sighed, wrapping his blanket back around himself before laying down beside him to watch the sleeping profile of the man who used to make his heart race.</p><p><em> Used </em> to.</p><p>Taiga had loved him…</p><p>Maybe…</p><p>When Taiga had slept in a cramped bed next to Juri before, without knowing it, there was something about it that had calmed him. There was a comforting warmth that he had never felt before, and at the time, Taiga wanted nothing more than to stay in it. Just being beside Juri gave him a certain bliss he didn't comprehend and an ache he didn't notice until the warmth was gone.</p><p>There was a time when Taiga had thought that maybe this was love.</p><p>But now, Taiga knew what it was like to be folded in someone's arms.</p><p>Now, he knew what it was like to be held against someone's chest and have their voice reverberate within it against his ear. To hear their heartbeat and to feel their heat until the morning came.</p><p>To be held by Hokuto.</p><p>To have Hokuto.</p><p>Even from just his brief slumber over Juri's body, Taiga could tell that with Hokuto, it was different…</p><p>The blanket fell to the floor as Taiga's fingers spread over the floor, placing on the space above Juri's shoulders.</p><p>…… Hokuto was much warmer.</p><p>The blonde strands of his hair slipped from behind his ear as he moved over him, hovering over the man who remained asleep beneath him.</p><p>Taiga watched the gentle breaths that left Juri's softly parted lips.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And as he leaned in, he apologized.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>To whoever was Juri's girlfriend and was his to be wife, Taiga was sorry.</p><p>It would only be once.</p><p>Maybe it was wrong for him to steal something so cherished, but Taiga felt that it was only fair.</p><p>With this, he would take as the last payment for his forgiveness.</p><p>It was only a touch, a simple brush, but months ago, Taiga would have believed this would have made his heart burst. He would have thought he had cursed himself with knowing the feel of Juri's lips, only to know that he wouldn't ever have them again. That he would have made himself watch Juri kiss his bride, knowing that it was something that had only stolen once, but would never belong to him.</p><p>It was still true that Taiga would never feel this again and he would still watch Juri say his vows to the mother of his child at the end of the aisle, but the person on Taiga's mind as he kissed Juri wasn't the groom soon to be.</p><p>All Taiga could think about was how it was nothing like his last.</p><p>His last kiss had been firm, but gentle.</p><p>It had a sweet bitterness that made his heart throb during and after they had parted.</p><p>It was a kiss that had given Taiga a hope that another would eventually follow, whenever it would be, a week, a month, the next day. Whenever. It carried a promise that he wanted to believe in, that it meant Hokuto would only think of him and he would be the only one…</p><p>But maybe some promises were just meant to be broken.</p><p>Taiga pulled away, tasting the cigarettes at the end of Juri's breath as he sat back, the other unaware of Taiga's theft in his sleep.</p><p>… He thought he would have at least felt something… Or anything at all… Even lingering old feelings that Taiga could cling to as an attempt to dampen the ache that wouldn't settle, but there was nothing.</p><p>Just the thoughts of someone else.</p><p>It was like a cruel comedy of errors that Taiga would fall out of love with someone he had thought had loved him to only have his heart broken by someone who made him believe it was all real.</p><p>Perhaps this was Taiga's curse for mocking and slandering love for so long, and whether it was or wasn't, Taiga wasn't eager to find out what his next punishment would be. The last two were painful enough.</p><p>Taiga rose to his feet.</p><p>Love just didn't come in a shape that was meant for him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Juri finally woke, he was covered by Taiga's discarded blanket as he was pulled from his sleep by the deep scent of fresh coffee and the variety of missed calls vibrating against his chest.</p><p>The first thing he saw when he sat up with his phone still buzzing in his breast pocket, was Taiga standing in the kitchen, hair wet with a towel around his neck and in a set of clothes that were different from when he had opened the door.</p><p>Juri's phone continued to rattle as he watched what almost looked like a completely different person pouring water in a glass coffee press.</p><p>When Taiga caught his gaze, Juri nearly flinched as the other raised his mug to his lips and spoke into it.</p><p>"... Are you going to get that?"</p><p>Juri blinked before finally slapping his hand over his phone against his chest.</p><p>"Oh. Uh- yes. Sorry," he said, ruffling his sleep tousled hair as he got to his feet and fished it out from his pocket. "Can I borrow your room to take this?"</p><p>"Sure. As long as you don't mind the mess."</p><p>"I'll take it."</p><p>"Hey, Juri?"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Juri looked up from the screen as his hand set on the handle to Taiga's room.</p><p>It didn't take words for Juri to know that the smile Taiga wore wasn't from joy.</p><p>"... I don't think I can write anymore."</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure how Juri would respond as the persistent buzzing of his phone filled the silent air between them. For a moment, he thought Juri's quiet stare was of defeat or disappointment.</p><p>But the moment Juri smiled back with his phone against his ear as he unlatched the door, Taiga knew he should have known better to have ever thought that Juri would have been anything short of understanding.</p><p>"Alright… We'll figure it out…"</p><p>"I promise."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As the days of the last month of his deadline passed by, Taiga could only stare at the white blank page.</p><p>He and Juri had given up on the idea of a full and complete manuscript heaping with beautiful imagery and a wonderful storyline for the chopped up scraps of what Taiga could manage to write in hopes that at least someone could see it's potential, even if Taiga wasn't sure himself of what it's potential was.</p><p>Juri was doing his best to make something out of nothing, but Taiga could only think of his resignation.</p><p>He had checked his bank account to see how long his royalties could hold him up for until he could eventually bring himself to write something or find another publisher that would give him enough pity. He thanked his past self for writing decent enough books in the past because at the moment, there was no chance that the chief editor would be taking what they had. Juri tried to stay positive and encourage him that there was still something that could be done, but the overflowing ashtray betrayed his words.</p><p>There was no doubt that Juri was just as stressed as he was because even Juri knew there was a slim to nothing chance of their botched up sorry excuse for a story making it through.</p><p>… Well, whatever.</p><p>What was another 10 pounds on top of the walls that already were crashing down on him?</p><p>Taiga poured himself a drink as he walked over to his neglected calendar.</p><p>The red cross marks had stopped after Taiga had torn the page off from the previous month, not wanting a reminder of how many days had passed since his fight with Hokuto, but after staring at the clean empty page, he figured he might as well fill it in.</p><p>He popped the cap off the felt pen and dragged a dark thick winding line down all the days to the last week where at the end, the last day was marked with a circle he had drawn 8 months ago.</p><p>In hindsight, drawing that circle was pointless.</p><p>From the very beginning, Taiga never really had any confidence that he'd make it. The last couple months had only set it in stone.</p><p>He looked up to read the ever steady ticking clock.</p><p>8:07 pm.</p><p>Juri was going to show the slapped together manuscript to some of his coworkers to get an idea of what others would think. There wouldn't be much time, but maybe they could use their feedback to fix it up before the end of the week.</p><p>Juri had said they would be meeting at 7. It was only about time he–</p><p>Taiga's phone pinged as if Juri had read his mind.</p><p>He slipped his phone from his pocket and tapped it to waken the screen.</p><p>One new message.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/>
<em>No good.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ah.</p><p>Taiga stared at his phone until the screen went dark, taking the message away with it.</p><p>Well…</p><p>It wasn't like Taiga wasn't expecting something like this, but he would have been lying if he said he hadn't been a little hopeful that his successful record would at least grant him a little grace…</p><p>Taiga held up his glass of highball to no one, to the absence of a presence across the table from what had become what he called <em> his seat </em>.</p><p>"... Cheers...To unemployment."</p><p>He kicked the glass back, draining his drink until all that was left was the ice that clattered at the bottom of his glass.</p><p>Thank God he had made the choice to pick up a 6-pack at the convenience store.</p><p>He would absolutely be drinking all 6 tonight.</p><p>The ring of his doorbell overlapped with the snap of the opening of his second can.</p><p>It has to be Juri.</p><p>No one came over this late unannounced.</p><p>Not anymore anyways.</p><p>Taiga took another big gulp before setting the can down to answer the door.</p><p>Misery loved company, at least.</p><p>"Juri, do-"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"You."</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>That certainly wasn't Juri's voice.</p><p>And the person at the door certainly wasn't Juri's height.</p><p>But before any of it could begin to register, a seathing sting exploded across his face.</p><p>All Taiga could do was hold his burning cheek while hands shoved him back into his own home as the voice spat again with a familiar poison.</p><p>"<em>You</em>."</p><p>"<b><em>You</em></b>!!"</p><p>"This is <b> <em>your</em> </b> fault!!!"</p><p>The woman introduced to Juri as Takeuchi Hinako slammed his door shut before his shirt was clutched in her manicured nails as she screamed at his face.</p><p>"<em>You </em> did this!!!!"</p><p>"<em>You </em> made Hokuto leave me!!!!!"</p><p>"You <em>fucking</em> <b><em>bitch</em></b>!!!!"</p><p>Taiga clenched his eyes shut when her hand reeled back, but it didn't save him from the burn that bloomed over his skin when she struck him again. He tried to pull her off of him by her shoulders, but Hinako was persistent, stretching his clothes and pulling at him relentlessly.</p><p>"This is <b>all </b>your fault!!! <b><em>You</em></b> made him leave me!!!!!! You <em>ruined</em> me!!!!! You ruined my <em>fucking</em> <b>life</b>–!! How <b>dare</b> you!!?!!"</p><p>"Wait-!"</p><p>"You're just a <b> <em>slut</em> </b>!!! How much did you open your legs for him to make him leave me, huh?!?!!!?"</p><p>"I-!"</p><p>"You ruined <b> <em>everything</em></b>!!!"</p><p>Before Hinako could strike him again, Taiga caught and gripped her wrist which only managed to infuriate her more. She gritted her teeth, yanking her hand back as she yelled at him to let go, lurching Taiga's grip on her wrist back and pulling him into her.</p><p>Taiga's feet stumbled as he tried to catch himself, but he could do nothing when Hinako shoved at his chest, toppling him backwards and allowing her to sit on and pin him down by his chest after he hit the floor.</p><p>Her nails raked red marks across his cheek when she swung her hand at him again.</p><p>"You <b> <em>took</em> </b> him from me!!!" Hinako screamed, her voice tearing through her throat.</p><p>"You <b> <em>stole</em> </b> him!!!"</p><p>With the next hit, Taiga's glasses went skating across the floor.</p><p>"Why couldn't you just let me be happy!?!!?!"</p><p>Taiga tried to hold up his arms over his face to protect himself, but they only took the brunt of her abuse as she pulled and tugged at them, trying to reach him again by digging her nails into his skin.</p><p>He didn't know what to do.</p><p>There was no way of reaching her.</p><p>No matter what Taiga said, he didn't think she would listen.</p><p>The only thing he could do was lay there and be her punching bag as she blamed him for things he didn't understand, saying Taiga had "taken", "stolen" and even "seduced."</p><p>If she spoke of Hokuto, it made no sense.</p><p>Hokuto was far from <em> his</em>.</p><p>But she said his name.</p><p>It didn't make sense.</p><p>"You!!" She gasped for breath as she pulled Taiga's arm back enough to sink her fingers into his hair to yank at it.</p><p>"You ruined my whole <b> <em>life</em></b>!!!"</p><p>"You took everything from me!!!!"</p><p>"All-!! All I ever wanted was him!!!"</p><p>Taiga winced, grabbing at her wrist to keep her from tugging any harder.</p><p>He said all he knew he could say, whether she would listen or not.</p><p>"I'm sorry!!"</p><p>"I'm sorry!!!! I'm sorry–!!!!! <em> Please</em>–!!!"</p><p>"Sorry isn't good enough!!!!"</p><p>A throb of pain washed through the back of his head when she lifted and shoved it back into the floor, cracking his skull against the hardwood.</p><p>"If you're sorry then give him back!!!"</p><p>"I- I can't-!!"</p><p>"Give him back!!!"</p><p>"I don't–!"</p><p>"<b><em>Please</em></b>!!!"</p><p>Taiga flinched, tightening his arm over his already battered face, defending himself from what her rath would inflict against him next as Hinako's voice started to form cracks.</p><p>But instead of hateful words and nails scratching into his arms, there was only the sound of hiccups and the feeling of droplets falling and rolling down his wrist.</p><p>When Taiga cracked open his eyes, he saw Hinako leaned over him, fists full of his shirt and eyes full of tears falling from her long lashes with her voice quivering as she begged again.</p><p>"Please–…. Give him back…"</p><p>"I-I'll do anything–…."</p><p>"I <em> love </em> him…."</p><p>"You have no idea how much I love him–… <em> Please– </em>…"</p><p>Her tears dropped onto Taiga's cheeks, rolling and trailing down his reddened skin as he listened quietly as she cried and begged, over and over.</p><p>It stung Taiga's heart to watch her cry.</p><p>It hurt and it hurt for her only because he knew exactly what she felt. To love someone so desperately to be brought to tears.</p><p>He stayed silent as her hands released from his shirt to clutch in front of her face, her breath growing ragged and her tears refusing to stop.</p><p>"H–he gave me everything–. I j-just wanted– wanted t-to love someone one-" Hinako sobbed, her speech broken by the shaking in her chest. "All… A-all my life i-it was- just deal- I was just a t-token but h-he-... He–!"</p><p>"I'm sorry…"</p><p>Taiga's voice was soft and low as she cried, her tears wetting his skin and his clothes as they fell one after another.</p><p>He said it again.</p><p>"I'm sorry…"</p><p>"... I'm <em> so </em> sorry…"</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure what to do.</p><p>Hinako had struck and beat him, but he couldn't help but feel her agony.</p><p>Even if it was a different monster, the squeeze in their chests and the ache in their hearts were the same.</p><p>Taiga may have suffered.</p><p>But what reason was there to add one more miserable person to this shit place called Earth?</p><p>Taiga reached out.</p><p>His hand and his heart.</p><p>If Hinako hit away his hand, he wouldn't have been surprised, but it was worth trying as his hand slowly went to set on her shoulder. He flinched back when she hiccuped, but continued, placing his hand on her arm, trying to give a comforting squeeze.</p><p>"... T-Takeuchi… was it?...."</p><p>She didn't respond, but she didn't deny it either as she continued to sob in her hands.</p><p>"... Before I say anything else… I want you to know that there is nothing between me and Matsumura. I swear over my own grave."</p><p>At least not anymore. If there ever was.</p><p>"So please…"</p><p>"... Can we just… talk?..."</p><p>At first it seemed like a miracle that Taiga had gotten Hinako to agree, but Hinako wasn't a bad person.</p><p>She was just broken.</p><p>The world had broken her with its crushing fist until all she had left was to comply with Hokuto as her only escape.</p><p>Taiga put a blanket over her shoulders after asking to take her uncomfortable but expensive coat.</p><p>"... Would you like water?... Or maybe coffee?"</p><p>Her small nod didn't tell him much, but Taiga went to prepare both.</p><p>The kettle clattered lightly on the stovetop, the fire coming to life below it. As the water boiled for the coffee press, Taiga snuck glances over to her in the living area, seeing how all she did was soak her last few tears into her hand cloth with an empty gaze in her eyes.</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but think of himself in Kochi's car on the way home.</p><p>As complicated as hearts were, the pain they felt was surprisingly simple.</p><p>The first thing she said to him after the crying stopped was "Your coffee tastes like his…"</p><p>Taiga peeked over his mug at her before looking down into the deep colored brew.</p><p>It tasted like his because it <em> was </em> his…</p><p>He was the one who taught him, after all.</p><p>"... Does it bother you?..."</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>"Honestly?… A little… but you swore, right?...... That there's nothing."</p><p>Taiga swallowed as he set down his mug on the coffee table.</p><p>"Yes… I promise."</p><p>"Then I'll enjoy it…" She brought the cup back to her lips.</p><p>"... It might be the last I'll ever have anyways…"</p><p>Taiga looked back down at the piece of Hokuto he wasn't aware he had, the foam from the milk swirling in the center.</p><p>"... Do you mind telling me how you met him?..."</p><p>Hinako told him everything.</p><p>The beginning, the middle, chapter 5, chapter 8. Everything.</p><p>Hokuto was her everything, but somewhere along their story, something went wrong.</p><p>Her family, her arranged marriage, how every part of her being was decided for her, it all broke her as Hokuto was the only person who saw her for who she was, and not the person her family made her to be. Her time with him was the best she ever had, but she couldn't stop the arrangement.</p><p>Hinako knew she couldn't have Hokuto as she wanted, so she didn't care how she kept him, as long as she had him at all, she didn't care.</p><p>It was only when Taiga entered the picture that everything started to crumble apart, and from how Hinako told her story, Taiga couldn't even bring himself to blame her for how she felt towards him.</p><p>If someone had taken the only person he had ever chosen for himself, he would have been angry at himself too.</p><p>"I did everything to keep women away," Hinako explained with a soft hiccup in her voice. "I spread rumors and said terrible things to anyone who got too close."</p><p>"It was only because you were a boy that I didn't notice."</p><p>"It was only until Hokuto didn't let me inside that I realized… He had always let me in… Even when girls had slept over, he would kick them so I could come in."</p><p>"But for you–... He said no."</p><p>Somehow Taiga felt ashamed. He knew there was no reason he should be, but it didn't change the guilt that sank in his stomach.</p><p>"... How did you know it was me?..."</p><p>Hinako squeezed her eyes shut, another tear escaping from her lashes. "Because I waited!... I saw you leave that morning! You were wearing that suit-..."</p><p>Taiga had no idea that Hinako had come over that day. There was no way he could have. His mind was wrecked and distraught with learning who he had thought to be his first love had gotten engaged.</p><p>He hadn't known that as he laid asleep in Hokuto's bed, when Hinako arrived at his door asking to be let inside, Hokuto had turned her away.</p><p>For him, Hokuto told Hinako no, the person Hokuto said he could never tell no, before returning to lay beside him and fall asleep next to him in the same bed.</p><p>Before he held him as he cried.</p><p>Before they kissed for the first time.</p><p>Taiga felt as if he had been caught doing the walk of shame.</p><p>"... I-... I'm sorry…"</p><p>"It's too late now…" Hinako murmured into her blanket. "I tried so hard to think it was nothing… but I couldn't take it. I used up all his free time on me because I couldn't fall asleep thinking that he was with you… I made him use all his time on me but–..."</p><p>Her tears came flooding back.</p><p>"I-... I thought I could leave him for just one day… but I couldn't stop the horrible feeling in my chest so I called him and asked him to come back to me."</p><p>"He said yes–! He t-told me over the phone that he would but he n-never–" The shake in her voice worsened.</p><p>"I knew something had to be wrong– I thought he would never leave me but then he-! He–!!"</p><p>As Hinako began to sob again, Taiga went to refill her glass of water before coming back to rub her back and offer her another tissue as his mind began to stir.</p><p>… There was so much he didn't know…</p><p>After that last night, Taiga had convinced himself that Hokuto had returned to her, disappointed by how his plan didn't work out and the bet was ruined, not to break up with Hinako and tell her that it was all over.</p><p>Yet, life was full of surprises, even if he didn't really understand what they meant.</p><p>Hokuto had left her.</p><p>Taiga had thought everything he did was for her.</p><p>… So what did it all mean?...</p><p>It couldn't have meant that Hokuto wasn't lying, right?...</p><p>As much as he wanted to forget, Taiga could still see the glimpse of pain that was deep in Hokuto's eyes as he screamed at him, telling him that he would never understand him. The desperation. The ache.</p><p>Taiga's eyes fluttered for a moment from the image that played from his memory.</p><p>… It wasn't that Hokuto really, <em> truly </em>–...</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… It didn't really matter.</p><p>Regardless of whoever actually occupied Hokuto's mind… He was all Hinako had.</p><p>Hinako needed him. Even with him, she was already falling apart at the seams. She needed Hokuto to put her back together.</p><p>And Hokuto loved, if not, had at least loved her once before.</p><p>Taiga was just some pitiful idiot who didn't understand romance.</p><p>He would live, whether or not Hokuto was there to hold him at night.</p><p>Taiga exhaled softly as he drew his hand away.</p><p>"... Have you told him? That you really love him?"</p><p>"Of course, I have!" She cried, defeated as she curled into the blanket. "I told him over and over again. I told him thousands of times…"</p><p>"... Have you… um…" Taiga held his mug that now held tea, not wanting to stay up all night from the caffeine. "Showed him?... That you love him?..."</p><p>Hinako raised her eyes from her lap to see Taiga staring into his drink.</p><p>"Of course, I did..."</p><p>"I bought him everything… I paid for everything… Is that not enough?..."</p><p>Taiga shook his head, tracing his thumb along the ceramic handle of his cup.</p><p>"No, sorry. That's not what I meant… There's no doubt you gave him plenty, I just–..."</p><p>"... What I mean was… Did you think about how Matsumura wants to be loved?"</p><p>Hinako blinked, her perfectly shaped brows furrowing as she clutched her cup.</p><p>"... What do you mean?....."</p><p>Taiga wasn't completely sure.</p><p>He just knew the moments that made him think Hokuto had cared. He hadn't fallen in love enough times to know any other way.</p><p>Taiga only knew how Hokuto made him feel.</p><p>"I don't mean to say I know any better… You know him way better than I do, but umm…"</p><p>"Have you ever just… let him spoil you?..."</p><p>The food. The service. The work. The time. The care.</p><p>Hokuto had given so much.</p><p>He cooked with him, taught him, ate with him as he smiled every time Taiga said it was delicious.</p><p>He stayed up, working. Writing. Taking notes when Taiga never asked. Even after Taiga told him to stop, he sat by him after working tirelessly at his own job to help any way he could.</p><p>Hokuto held him when he cried.</p><p>He arrived in a flash after a text.</p><p>He kissed him.</p><p>He embraced him.</p><p>His actions spoke more than words.</p><p>Hokuto had told him he loved him over and over without saying a word.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Perhaps…</p><p>… But this wasn't about him.</p><p>It should have never been about him.</p><p>"Maybe you gave so much you never let him share the burden…"</p><p>"He likes to-... I-I think-..." Taiga stammered, not wanting to claim any knowledge over someone who has known him for years. "He likes to have you depend on him…"</p><p>"You like to give… but let him give something back. A relationship shouldn't be one-sided, right?..."</p><p>Hinako pulled her knees to her chest. "But I can't give him everything… I'm married… Don't I have to make up for that?"</p><p>"I don't think so…" Taiga said quietly. "Just letting him know you love him and being there should be enough."</p><p>If Hokuto loved her deeply enough to stay with her for 5 years without asking for anything else, it should certainly be enough.</p><p>Just having Hokuto there had been enough for him.</p><p>Hinako sniffled. "You really think so?..."</p><p>"... I don't know… but I think so…" Taiga said, handing her another tissue.</p><p>"... Isn't that enough to try?"</p><p>They talked for a while longer.</p><p>Hinako talked about her worries and insecurities as Taiga comforted her the best he could. They talked or simply stayed quiet as Hinako cried until she couldn't bring herself to cry anymore.</p><p>The day had turned late before they knew it, and as Hinako traded the blanket for her coat, Taiga pulled a few books from his shelf to hand to her by the door.</p><p>"Here. If you just want an escape."</p><p>Her eyes traveled over the cover as she took them from his hands.</p><p>"... What are these?..."</p><p>"Just some modern fantasy… They're good to escape with so… if things ever get hard, maybe try to read these."</p><p>The front was covered in washes of colors depicting a complicated but simple world that was much like their own, but was different.</p><p>She held them to her chest.</p><p>"How much are these worth?... Let me pay you –" she said as she began to look through her purse.</p><p>Taiga waved his hands as she looked back up at him. "No, it's okay. I get a lot of them for free anyways. Just take them."</p><p>"... But promise me one thing in exchange."</p><p>"... Sure."</p><p>"Talk to him."</p><p>Her lips pressed together.</p><p>"But… what if-"</p><p>"Just try…"</p><p>Taiga placed his hand over hers on the books. "He loves you… If anything… he'll listen… and listen to him too."</p><p>"Thank you… I'll try," Hinako barely nodded.</p><p>"I'm… I'm sorry I hit you…"</p><p>Taiga had honestly forgotten about the burning lines on his skin, but his cheek would recover.</p><p>Broken hearts were much harder to mend.</p><p>"It's alright. I'll be fine."</p><p>He opened the door for her as a thought came to his mind. "Um… Do you mind me asking something?"</p><p>"Hmm?" Hinako turned back to him after stepping out.</p><p>"... How did you know where I live?..."</p><p>Hinako almost looked embarrassed or even a little ashamed as her eyes broke away from his with a timid smile.</p><p>"... Let's just say my husband knows people. And I knew your name and your company…"</p><p>"You can learn anything by saying the right thing and talking to the right people…"</p><p>Ah.</p><p>"I see…"</p><p>Scary.</p><p>Hokuto was with someone much scarier that Taiga could ever imagine handling.</p><p>"Have a good night, Kyomoto..."</p><p>"... You too, Takeuchi…"</p><p>Taiga hoped to never see her again after closing the door. Not that he disliked her, just that with this, he wanted it to all be over.</p><p>Hinako would go back to Hokuto to make things work and Hokuto would take her back. They would have their happily ever after now that the plot point of their story named "Kyomoto Taiga" was now done.</p><p>So where did that leave him?... The Kyomoto Taiga that was still in love with Matsumura Hokuto?...</p><p>Who cares.</p><p>Taiga just knew that all he wanted to do right now was write.</p><p>A language beyond language.</p><p>A feeling beyond speech.</p><p>An affection without words.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"... Should I ask what happened?"</p><p>Taiga just shoved his laptop into Juri's hands, making no further mention of the bandage over his cheek the other stared at.</p><p>"No. Just read."</p><p>"Kyomo, as much as I love your determination, there's only 2 days left. I really don't think-"</p><p>Taiga pushed down at Juri's shoulders, forcing him onto his couch.</p><p>"Sure, whatever. I don't care. Just read it."</p><p>Juri sighed, placing a fresh cigarette between his lips as he scrolled past the pages.</p><p>He had thought there would only be one or two of them, but as the words and pages just kept going and going, his cigarette nearly fell from his mouth as it widened.</p><p>"Christ–! Just how much did you write? Were you hiding all of this from me??"</p><p>Taiga rolled his sore neck and wrist as he sat. "No, I only started writing it a couple days ago."</p><p>Juri swiped his fingers on the touchpad, the pages flying past again to return to the top. "A couple-... What?! A couple days ago?!"</p><p>"What the hell happened?? Did you lose your mind???"</p><p>"Kind of– Juri, just read it already."</p><p>Juri sighed as he sat back, looking over the first sentence.</p><p>"Alright, fine," he said as he pulled his glasses from his briefcase. "Can you make me a drink then?"</p><p>Taiga got back onto his feet to immediately go to the kitchen.</p><p>Whatever it took for Juri to just shut up and read.</p><p>"What do you want? Coffee? Tea? Alcohol?"</p><p>"Whatever you think suits whatever this is best."</p><p>"Then tea."</p><p>After 5 cups of tea, a few bathroom breaks and a snack, Juri was reaching the end of the text with his fingers covering his mouth that had been hanging open, enthralled as he read.</p><p>Taiga was preparing dinner when he nearly choked from the whack that landed on his back, not expecting Juri to shove the laptop into the couch and run into the kitchen just to hit him with childlike excitement.</p><p>"Kyomo!!!" He shouted as he looped his arms around Taiga's shoulders, shaking him.</p><p>"God damnit!! Kyomo!!" He shouted with his huge wide grin as Taiga quickly placed down his knife safely.</p><p>"It's good!!!"</p><p>"It's really <b>fucking</b> good!!! What the hell happened to you!?!"</p><p>"It's a long— story-" Taiga struggled to respond as Juri continued to squeeze and rattle him like a large toy.</p><p>"Well, fuck it!! It doesn't matter!! It's good, Kyomo!! It's really really good!!"</p><p>Taiga pushed back up his glasses that had been jostled down his nose.</p><p>"But it's not long enough–"</p><p>It was only enough to cover the first and a half of the second chapter.</p><p>It was nowhere near the full manuscript that was requested in two days.</p><p>"You're right!!" Juri's volume was the same, but the enthusiasm was dampened by the truth. "... It's not!... But it's better than before."</p><p>"With this, it's worth a shot. If it takes all night for me to edit, then I'll do it. <em> This </em> is worth it."</p><p>Taiga gripped Juri's arms that had ceased their shaking.</p><p>"... So you are having dinner here?"</p><p>Juri laughed, letting go to squeeze the top of Taiga's shoulders. "If you'll have me. And for tonight."</p><p>"... And probably tomorrow. And the next morning..."</p><p>"Okay, Juri, I get the point."</p><p>Juri grinned as Taiga pushed him back.</p><p>Taiga had forgotten how nice it felt to smile as he returned one to his friend.</p><p>"So!" Juri said with a deep breath to prepare himself for the hours ahead. "We eat and then try to make magic happen?"</p><p>"Sure," Taiga laughed.</p><p>"Whatever that magic is."</p><p>Magic is what Juri called it.</p><p>But it was more like they needed a miracle.</p><p>For the next two days, all that they did was work.</p><p>Taiga wrote. Juri read and made comments.</p><p>Taiga wrote again. Juri read again.</p><p>Rinse and repeat until the morning of their deadline where Taiga quickly made final edits and touch ups while he listened to Juri beg for an unscheduled meeting, bowing to nothing but the wall in front of him.</p><p>After Juri told him they got a yes, everything was a blur.</p><p>Juri shoving him in the shower.</p><p>Getting dressed.</p><p>Getting in the car.</p><p>Going into the office.</p><p>Sitting in front of the chief editor holding what looked more like a college pamphlet than a manuscript.</p><p>Taiga stared down at the white table as Juri did his best to sell it, emphasizing its creativity and the results of their determined effort.</p><p>Juri was good with his words, explaining with dramatized detail just how hard Taiga worked and how wonderful and successful his previous book had been, but the chief editor only held a frown as he thumbed through the pages.</p><p>"Please, Matsumoto…" Juri pleaded again with his head bowed.</p><p>"We know it isn't much, but please understand that Kyomoto has the potential… It's not long, but it has life. I have read many lengths of manuscripts in my career and just that alone has so much more than many of the hundreds of pages we get from prospective writers."</p><p>"So please, if you would even just take another day to consider…"</p><p>The chief sighed, setting down the incomplete story down on the table. "... It's good… I won't lie about that… but it's a hard sell to the publishers to ask for more time again… Just one chapter doesn't give promise."</p><p>Juri's shoulders deflated, but was still nowhere near ready to give in. "I understand, but I swear. I'll do whatever it takes to make sure that it comes out great. We'll even work on a tightened deadline. I promise to take full responsibility."</p><p>If Juri had bowed any deeper, his forehead would have collided with the top of the table.</p><p>Taiga only raised his head when the chief said his name.</p><p>"Kyomoto."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"I just have one question."</p><p>"... Yes."</p><p>Juri glanced back and forth between the two of them as neither of their gazes relented to the thickening pressure.</p><p>"Is this a romance?"</p><p>Taiga wanted to laugh.</p><p>It was incredible how circular life was…</p><p>Juri looked back to Taiga as the silence grew longer, growing anxious by the absence of his response as he began to beg in his head for Taiga to give a reply that didn't backtrack all his efforts.</p><p>Taiga did finally answer, but what came from his mouth made Juri cringe.</p><p>"... Why don't you let me write the rest so you can find out?"</p><p>It came out in a huff and was blazé as he said it, but Taiga didn't know how to say it any other way as he ignored the sharp bump Juri gave his foot with his own from under the table.</p><p>Taiga just didn't like all the groveling.</p><p>If the company wanted to take his story, then they would take it, if they didn't then they wouldn't.</p><p>That was life and that's how life went.</p><p>All the pleading and pleasing could sway a person if they were soft, but more often than not, a person will have already made up their mind. The formalities and pleasantries were all just fillers for what was already decided.</p><p>In Juri's opinion, it was his typical businessman persuasion that got the chief to accept their deal and that's what he insisted the whole way home, but Taiga couldn't help but believe it was because the chief editor was impressed that he had enough balls to stand up to the reputation of Matsumoto Jun.</p><p>In the end, it didn't matter who was right or wrong and they could have argued about it all night. All it truly meant was now there were many more tireless nights ahead of them.</p><p>Now, they had to make the product.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>3 years ago, Taiga didn't care about clothes.</p><p>3 years later, he still really didn't care.</p><p>Also, since when did his company care so much about PR?...</p><p>For his last several books, he hardly did anything besides one or two short inserts for a publication announcement or even just a signature for a bookstore display. It was the responsibility of the sellers and the stores to create enough promotion for their units to sell.</p><p>So why was it that he now had to stand around while Juri found an outfit that "most suited his image"?</p><p>What image???</p><p>He didn't have an image.</p><p>All he did was write books for people to read and maybe even enjoy their time reading it. Why did he have to have an image?</p><p>Usually after a book went on sale, Taiga just slept and ordered expensive take out for himself. Maybe he would even enjoy the wine he got gifted as a congratulations.</p><p>So why did he have to do interviews and appearances now??</p><p>The "grand return" of his books, he guessed, from how many times Juri had mentioned it.</p><p>Juri stepped back to look at his work, grinning pridefully about his own personal choices even if the suit was slightly soured by Taiga's frown.</p><p>"Perfect."</p><p>"Is it? You said that 8 ties ago."</p><p>"No, I'm settled with this one. This one is perfect," he smiled as he waved down a clerk to make last adjustments before they checked out.</p><p>"So we can go home after this, right?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>Taiga wanted to groan like a spoiled child, but he kept it in his chest as the tailor cuffed and marked where to adjust the length of his pants.</p><p>"... What else, Juri?"</p><p>"This."</p><p>His eyes nearly crossed when Juri brushed at his bangs where the dark color of his hair had long replaced the bright blonde that had been cut and left on a salon floor before pulling off Taiga's glasses from his nose.</p><p>"And this."</p><p>3 years of work and it all came down to this… Getting his hair bleached again and learning how to place contact lenses in his eyes.</p><p>The last years had been endless amounts of work as it always was, but Taiga's bold shot in the dark wouldn't go unpunished.</p><p>The company made sure that they would be made to work on a short schedule.</p><p>Taiga didn't remember how many times he apologized to both Juri and his girlfriend about how the work would postpone their wedding and how many nights Juri was made to sleep on his couch. His guilt was only made worse when Juri's child was born to the point where Taiga asked again and again to help pay for her childcare, but Juri always refused. He only ever asked for Taiga to let him bring his baby over during their work so his girlfriend could have a break.</p><p>Aside from the crying, it never became a problem, even if some of his books had become play toys. It was manageable, but Taiga was still endlessly grateful when Juri's girlfriend had taken herself and their child to spend time with her parents back in Osaka.</p><p>Taiga had asked Juri if he should be going with them, but he told him no, saying that once he was done babysitting him, he would have all the time in the world to spend with his new born.</p><p>… Though, somehow, even after the book was done, Juri managed to waste his time making sure Taiga looked nothing like himself for his interviews.</p><p>It wasn't at all part of Juri's job description. He just wanted to.</p><p>Taiga barely recognized himself in the mirror after Juri stilled a smooth sweep in his hair for his interview the next day.</p><p>The blonde he had seen before, but the contacts and the fitted suit really made it something else. He looked good… probably?... But all Taiga wanted was just to return to his large t-shirt and shorts in the comfort of his own home.</p><p>He had completed his magazine interview weeks ago and all that was left was the TV appearance and a book signing.</p><p>Comparatively, the magazine interview was painless, quick and concise. It was simple and he also didn't have to wear a tie.</p><p>There wasn't much he could have said. It wasn't like there was exactly a plethora of creative ways to describe the growing relationship between a blind man and his mute caretaker who cooked for him and how they learned to share their feelings and thoughts without relying on words.</p><p>The questions were straightforward, as expected for a literary publication. The readers weren't really there for all the fluff.</p><p>Just what, when, where and why.</p><p>Taiga answered them as honestly and as directly as the questions themselves. There was no gain in lying in the same fashion that there was no loss in telling the truth, so he answered with the whole truth… Minus the personal details.</p><p>What was the book? A book about growth.</p><p>When did you think of the book? Years ago.</p><p>Where do you imagine this book? Salut.</p><p>Why did you write it? He had to and it was all he had on his mind.</p><p>In hindsight, maybe he shouldn't have mentioned Salut by name, but he said it before Juri could stop him.</p><p>"You know, you've just about exiled yourself from ever going back there. People are going to look for you," is what Juri told him afterwards in their elevator ride down.</p><p>Taiga just responded with a sigh as he leaned against the wall, knocking his head back onto the cold metal surface.</p><p>"It's fine…"</p><p>"I wasn't planning on going back any time soon anyways."</p><p>The magazine had been fine with just him, Juri and the man with thick glasses across from him in a small room, but in the space rushed with people and large TV cameras, Taiga was far more overwhelmed.</p><p>The constant stage directions Juri rambled to him didn't make his nerves any better either.</p><p>"Smile." Juri whispered to him quickly as a stage hand waved them over.</p><p>"Don't forget to smile."</p><p>"Laugh if you're nervous."</p><p>"Be friendly."</p><p>"Don't act like you don't want to be here."</p><p>The last one was the hardest out of all of them because he <em> didn't </em> want to be there and it very obviously showed on his face, but Taiga did the best he could to be charming as he took a deep breath.</p><p>Hokuto did it for years.</p><p>How bad could 15 minutes really be?</p><p>For 15 minutes, Taiga acted like Hokuto when his character was on, doing the best he could to follow Juri's directions as he smiled and laughed for the pre-filmed show.</p><p>He should have guessed that the TV interview would be different. Unlike the literary interview a week ago, the questions were less about the book and were more about him.</p><p>The magazine was selling his book.</p><p>This was selling the author.</p><p>Even so, Taiga answered honestly because honesty was the easiest to say as he told the woman across from him why the book was the way he had written it and what had inspired him.</p><p>Who inspired him.</p><p>Taiga didn't lie about what he said about Hokuto either.</p><p>He really didn't think Hokuto would ever want to speak to him again.</p><p>Taiga had said horrible things and called petty names before walking away because he couldn't tell him that he was wrong.</p><p>Hokuto was right. Taiga had used him. He was just too busy wallowing in his own self-pity to see it. He had asked Hokuto for selfish things, pulling him and dragging him along by his own self-will because Hokuto let him and Taiga was shallow enough to believe it wouldn't hurt him.</p><p>Taiga knew better now.</p><p>Hokuto had given him so much and Taiga had the audacity to ever call him selfish.</p><p>Taiga denied all of it when Hokuto truly did-...</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He had–…</p><p>………</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Well, it was too far too late to apologize now.</p><p>Forgive and forget, though he couldn't do the former.</p><p>If everything had gone as Taiga had thought, Hinako was surely at his side, happy and peaceful in their repaired love.</p><p>Not even for a second had Taiga ever imagined that he would see Hokuto waiting in the line of his signing, clutching his book in his hands.</p><p>Taiga nearly let the book he was handed slip from his fingers as he dragged his eyes away from Hokuto's.</p><p>It had been so long since he had seen that gaze.</p><p>He had seen it so many times before, when they cooked, when they shopped, when they kissed, when Taiga had said his last words before swearing to never see him again.</p><p>Yet, it still managed to shake him as much as the day he could see the red lipstick stains smudged across his lips.</p><p>Taiga tried to stay focused on the person in front of him, to keep a smile and write his name cleanly into the paper of the book, but he couldn't help his eyes from being pulled back to him.</p><p>It was only once Hokuto approached the table when Taiga was able to keep his gaze down, watching the wrist that was no longer encircled by a gold chain.</p><p>It almost felt like something was missing from it when it reached out with his unchristened book in its hands.</p><p>As Taiga took the book and creased the cover as he opened it, he didn't understand.</p><p>Even now, he <em> still </em> didn't understand.</p><p>So he asked.</p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>What was he here for?</p><p>What did his invite mean?...</p><p align="center">
  <em> "... I was hoping you would be my boyfriend after." </em>
</p><p>Taiga didn't understand as the name he had removed from his vocabulary nearly slipped from his lips, watching wordlessly as Hokuto told him he would wait for him.</p><p>He said he would wait.</p><p>The words replayed in Taiga's mind during and after the signing was over. Even as Juri led him to his car to the restaurant he had booked, the words stayed in Taiga's ears.</p><p>… There was just simply no way he would… right?...</p><p>Taiga couldn't enjoy the drinks that were given to him at his celebration party as all he could do was watch the clock as time passed.</p><p>6:42 pm.</p><p>Kochi arrived with a smile and a congratulations, giving Taiga his gift of a new journal and a pen that wrote beautifully. Taiga thanked him as Kochi gave his side a hug, saying "I knew you could do it."</p><p>7:54 pm.</p><p>Juri slung his arm over his shoulder, shoving a beer into his hand that Taiga would nurse slowly, only so that the glass wouldn't be filled again.</p><p>9:19 pm.</p><p>The party was slowing down, some had left, but others were still ready to move to the next bar. Juri was far gone, but still energetic as ever.</p><p>10:48 pm.</p><p>Kochi had only stayed so long because Juri wouldn't let him leave. Taiga finally convinced Juri to use the bathroom so that Kochi could escape.</p><p>11:37 pm.</p><p>Taiga told everyone he would walk home.</p><p>Thankfully, everyone was either too drunk or too tired to question it.</p><p>It was pouring.</p><p>He bowed to the restaurant owner who offered him an umbrella left behind by a previous customer, thanking him and wishing him a goodnight.</p><p>And as soon as the door closed, Taiga's dress shoes splashed lightly into the shallow puddles of the sidewalk as his legs began to move on their own with the question that had been reeling in his mind all night repeating again.</p><p>He couldn't be.</p><p>He couldn't.</p><p>Not with the rain.</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>But his feet still moved and his legs still walked.</p><p>It would take while, but Taiga was already in the city and he knew the way.</p><p>Taiga truly didn't think that Hokuto would wait for so long.</p><p>He didn't deserve to be waited for.</p><p>… But Hokuto told him he would wait.</p><p>Taiga had doubted his words before and he was wrong back then… So what reason did he have to believe that he couldn't be wrong again?...</p><p>His feet quickened.</p><p>The words replayed again in his mind, but maybe only to save himself from ache if they were true.</p><p>He couldn't be waiting.</p><p>If he wasn't there, then it was over. Taiga would be right.</p><p>There was just simply no way that Hokuto would have waited for him this whole time.</p><p>And if he was there?...</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Then…</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga's feet stopped as he reached the corner, his breath coming out in huffs in the humid air.</p><p>A lump formed in his throat as he looked at the front of Salut.</p><p>And the figure curled up beside it.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Waiting.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Still.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga didn't understand.</p><p>He didn't understand romance.</p><p>None of it made any sense.</p><p>Why would anyone sit in the rain and wait for someone to show up after not speaking to each other for 3 years?...</p><p>It was ridiculous.</p><p>… But then why would someone come to check to see if they were still there even after the time had passed midnight in the middle of the pouring rain?...</p><p>Taiga's hand tightened around the smooth handle of the umbrella.</p><p>Romance.</p><p>Care.</p><p>Affection.</p><p>Love.</p><p>He held the umbrella out, sheltering Hokuto from the rain as he gazed up at him with glazed eyes.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… It couldn't hurt to find out...</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The second to last chapter!!! I'm not really sure what to say about this haha! I wonder if this is how people thought this chapter would turn out, ending with the same cliff hanger that we had the chapter before, but I thought it was important to show Taiga's side during the last three years as well. I hope this chapter is good. I went a little back and forth with it! Either way, the next chapter will be the last... I hope this series has been enjoyable on the way and that the last chapter is something to look forward to! It might take me a little while to get this last one out though since I wanted to add some things last minute hehe.</p><p>Other things I'm working on... I'm not working on anything else at the moment!! I'm not sure what it is, I don't have the brain space to work on anything else right now... I have the two fics planned in my head, but even when I open a new document to start it, I feel rather intimidated. Maybe I need to take a step back and understand my writing voice again. I'll definitely need it as I start venturing into this next long fic adventure... I am excited to widen the plot of Recall though. I've had this idea for quite a while now and I hope the time it has spent brewing in my head will pay off in its result!</p><p>As always, I love to hear what people think!!! I do wonder what people think will happen in this last chapter haha!! I still can't quite believe its the end... my brain hasn't completely caught up to that reality yet. In a way, it feels like there's still so much more to do and so much more to post, but the last will be the last! Has this been better than KoiMaji? I really  hope I was able to get the whole plot idea a little more life than the drama... but maybe I didn't!</p><p>I have a Twitter that I post fic updates and fic previews to!! I've been a little low on activity lately since I've really been focusing on writing, but maybe as I finish up this fic, I'll be back on there more often! My DMs are also always open if you  have any questions or if you would like to talk!!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"... Kyomoto?..."</p><p>"... Matsumura, I–"</p><p>Hokuto still couldn't believe it.</p><p>It still didn't feel real.</p><p>Before Taiga could say anything, Hokuto pulled him into his arms.</p><p>Hokuto's body was cold, his wet clothes seeping into Taiga's tailored suit as the umbrella was knocked out from Taiga's hand, submitting them both back under the rain.</p><p>Taiga was speechless as Hokuto's hold tightened.</p><p>He just let Hokuto cling to him, his arms around his shoulders and his fingers clutched into his suit as he buried his face into the curve of his neck.</p><p dir="ltr">Hokuto might have been cold, but his breath was warm against Taiga's skin as the rain slowly drenched him.</p><p>"... You came…"</p><p>"... You actually came…."</p><p>Maybe Taiga could have said something snarky or sharp to lighten the mood that was slowly becoming overbearing, but when Taiga tried to speak, his words got stuck in his throat.</p><p>All he could do was nod and hold Hokuto back.</p><p>"... You're real, right?..." Hokuto spoke into Taiga collar, his voice shaking. "I'm not just dreaming?..."</p><p>Taiga shook his head, finally managing to make his speech croak from his throat. </p><p>"I'm here… I'm real…"</p><p>"... You waited…"</p><p>Hokuto's arms squeezed around him.</p><p>"I told you I would wait… I would have waited for you forever…"</p><p>Taiga's chest gave a weak laugh as his hands gripped what he could of the back of Hokuto's soaked shirt. "You're an idiot… You would have died."</p><p>"That's fine…" Hokuto muttered into Taiga's collar.</p><p>"... As long as it meant seeing you."</p><p>Taiga hit his fist into Hokuto's back.</p><p>He wished he could have sounded more cool, but the crack in his voice ruined everything.</p><p>"Just take me inside already…"</p><p>"Before you freeze to death."</p><p>Hokuto only let go once Taiga pushed him off of him.</p><p>As they went towards Hokuto's door, Hokuto made Taiga walk before him, afraid that if he were to leave his sight, Taiga would disappear. Even as he undid the lock to his flat, he had Taiga stand between him and the door as he leaned in, encircling himself around him with his chest pressed against his back while he turned the key.</p><p>Once the door swung open and they both stumbled in, Hokuto immediately looped Taiga back into his hold.</p><p>As it closed, the steady sigh of the falling showers outside were muted as neither of them spoke, leaving only the sound of the scattered pattering of the rain dripping from their clothes onto the hardwood floor and the quiet breaths that escaped their lips.</p><p>In the silence, Taiga could hear and feel Hokuto's heart pounding against his back as he placed his hands over the ones clasped tightly around his waist, gazing into the dimly lit room through his water-stained glasses. </p><p>There was no doubt that his was pounding too. </p><p>The rain in their hair blended together as Hokuto nudged his head against Taiga's from over his shoulder with Taiga leaning his temple onto his. Droplets rolled and fell from their chins in the quiet while Taiga smoothly threaded his fingers between Hokuto's over the back of his hands. </p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… Did they really need to say it?...</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Both of them knew.</p><p>Both of them had known for forever.</p><p>They didn't have to.</p><p><em>This </em> was enough.</p><p>Taiga buried his nose into Hokuto's damp hair before whispering softly into his hairline, gently pulling his hands loose from around his waist.</p><p>"... You should change your clothes…"</p><p>Hokuto stayed silent as Taiga turned to him, only watching how Taiga's eyes lowered to his chest.</p><p>"... I should too."</p><p>… It still felt like a dream.</p><p>Even after Taiga told him in his own voice it was real and after he felt warm in his arms, Hokuto still couldn't bring himself to believe this was all more than a vivid dream. </p><p>Taiga was here.</p><p>With him.</p><p>It was unbelievable.</p><p>… But even if it was all just a dream, Hokuto would take and value every second of it.</p><p>All of it could just be delusions as his body gave into the heavy rain outside the front of Salut, but he didn't really care.</p><p>Just having Taiga in his dreams was more than Hokuto could have ever wished for.</p><p>He pressed his jaw against Taiga's crown as Taiga's hands smoothed down his chest, his fingers undoing each button on his shirt one by one, loosening the damp fabric that stuck to Hokuto's skin. After the sleeves fell free from his arms, Hokuto cupped the sides of Taiga's neck, not wasting a second on his shirt that dropped heavily to the floor.</p><p>The only thing that mattered to him was the feel of Taiga's skin.</p><p>For years he had yearned for it after having a taste of it, holding Taiga in his sleep and exchanging meaningless kisses, but now he couldn't resist as it was a completely different heat. </p><p>Because now, Taiga looked at him. </p><p>Taiga didn't accept his touch because he mourned over Juri or just because he wanted to know what it felt like.</p><p>Taiga came for him. </p><p>And Hokuto clung to that with his whole life.</p><p>Hokuto threaded his fingers into the ends of Taiga's pale hair, the rain that was caught in strands collecting along them, trailing and rolling down along his wrists. </p><p>As Taiga placed his hands over Hokuto's, spreading the droplets between their hold, he lifted his chin to bump the bridge of his nose against Hokuto's, the frames of his glasses softly clattering between them.</p><p>"... Hey…"</p><p>His breath was hot against Hokuto's lips as he led Hokuto's wide palm down over his collar to the tie around his neck.</p><p>"... Me too…"</p><p>There were many nights Taiga imagined Hokuto doing something like this with someone else, removing each other's clothes piece by piece as the rush and heat of desire raced through their veins. Maybe there had even been one or two alcohol-imbibed nights where Taiga had dreamed it was himself, waking with his body hot and swimming with shame before forcing himself back to sleep without another thought.</p><p>But Taiga never imagined it would be like this.</p><p>Whether in his mind's eye or in his dreams, there was an impatient haste.</p><p>He never imagined that Hokuto would bury his face in his neck as he carefully pulled his tie loose before slowly pushing his suit jacket from his shoulders.</p><p>The process of undressing often meant sex, especially when another person was there to do it for them, leaving themselves bare for the other to possess for pleasure.</p><p>But this was nothing like that.</p><p>For a long time, Taiga didn't understand. Hokuto confused him time and time again, unsure of what he meant or felt or wanted.</p><p>Now, it was all so clear. </p><p>Now, Hokuto was a glass case and Taiga could see right into his heart. </p><p>After all, it was Hokuto who taught him.</p><p>Hokuto told him he was scared when he hid himself in his neck.</p><p>He whispered just how much he missed him through his hesitant hands that took their time smoothing down his bare arms, leaving the damp dress shirt to join the discarded clothes on the floor.</p><p>Even just the beating of his heart sang songs of how much he wanted to see him.</p><p>All of which spoke love.</p><p>… It was about time for Taiga to say it too.</p><p>He had waited too long before.</p><p>He wasn't going to lose his chance now.</p><p>"... Matsumura..."</p><p>Taiga whispered into his hair, placing his hand on his cheek and leading him away from his shoulder.</p><p>Hokuto's eyes wandered over Taiga's features as he drew away from Taiga's skin, his voice still uneasy.</p><p>"... Taiga?..."</p><p>Taiga would apologize a million times over later.</p><p>He would apologize for not believing. For not trusting. For making him hurt over and over. For using him. For loving him. For scaring him, even now as they stood nearly bare with each other.</p><p>But it would be for later.</p><p>For now, Taiga wanted to love him.</p><p>Nothing else.</p><p>"Hokuto."</p><p>Taiga's eyes lowered as Hokuto grew close, their noses brushing.</p><p>There were some things that 3 years couldn't change.</p><p>Taiga watching his lips as an ask for a kiss was just the first Hokuto would learn.</p><p>"... Will you kiss me?...." </p><p>Taiga's fingers began to trail along Hokuto's jaw, catching the drops that tempted to fall from his chin as his voice carried on his breath.</p><p>"... As training?....." Hokuto barely whispered, his breath warming Taiga's lips.</p><p>Taiga hoped Hokuto would understand his answer when he closed the space between them, pressing his lips into his.</p><p>No.</p><p>He dug his fingers into Hokuto's hair, pulling him closer as Hokuto looped his arms around his waist.</p><p>Never.</p><p>Hokuto only managed to release a sigh and catch a glimpse of Taiga's half-lidded eyes before Taiga tilted his head, capturing his lips again.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>Taiga moved Hokuto's lips apart with his, asking for Hokuto to taste him, which Hokuto eagerly received.</p><p>He wanted him.</p><p>He wanted Hokuto.</p><p>He wanted to love him and take him and never let him go.</p><p>No more games or hidden messages. No more regretful goodbyes and painful gazes.</p><p>No more.</p><p>No more or his heart might just fall apart.</p><p>Hokuto wiped away the tears Taiga didn't know fell from his closed eyes.</p><p>
  <em> I love you. </em>
</p><p><em> I love you with all my heart</em>.</p><p>Taiga told him with every kiss, clash of their teeth and whisper of his name.</p><p>
  <em> I love you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I love you. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please never leave me again. </em>
</p><p>Hokuto said the same, rocking his lips into each kiss and swallowing Taiga's breath before taking it again.</p><p>It had been so long since a kiss had made him feel so alive.</p><p>Hokuto had pointlessly given it to so many, hoping it would numb the ache in his chest and cheapen it's worth so that when the person he wanted to value it most treated it like nothing, he would be able to believe the same.</p><p>But Taiga took each like it would be their last, breathing and gasping, refusing to patiently wait for the next.</p><p>It made his heart sore.</p><p>Even if Taiga's tongue was clumsy and his lips would fumble as Hokuto dragged his hand up his smooth back, Hokuto wouldn't trade it for the world and the world next.</p><p>Because it was him.</p><p>And Taiga was his everything.</p><p>Before, then and now.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Taiga gasped as Hokuto placed kisses under his ear and down his neck, shuddering and dragging his nails through Hokuto's hair.</p><p>"H-Hoku-"</p><p>Hokuto took his lips again, sealing them and claiming his mouth as they stumbled until the back of Taiga's legs hit the side of Hokuto's bed, bringing them both down on top of Hokuto's soft covers.</p><p>Their kiss broke when they fell, Hokuto's hand sinking into his plush blankets, catching himself over Taiga's shoulder. Their chests heaved as their eyes met in the midst of their paused affection, becoming breathless in the wash of golden light from Hokuto's bedside lamp.</p><p>They were still the same people.</p><p>They were just the same as they were when Hokuto had come to Taiga's table earlier today.</p><p>But somehow, it was all different.</p><p>It all felt different knowing the other felt the same.</p><p>They could only guess that's just what love does.</p><p>How strange the thing called love was…</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as Hokuto gently slipped off his glasses from his nose, blindly placing them safely on the sill above them to not spare a moment to miss how Taiga's lashes fluttered open for his eyes to meet his again.</p><p>The drops of rain that fell from their hair and skin seeped into the light fabric of Hokuto's bed, staining it dark as Taiga slowly reached up to touch Hokuto's lips. He barely touched the tips of his fingers to the reddened and swollen skin that had grown warm, his heart racing knowing that it was because of his kiss.</p><p>Years ago, the idea of this scene would have been Taiga's worst nightmare.</p><p>If he had ever told his younger self that he would one day be laying under another man shirtless, he would have surely laughed in his face.</p><p>He would have said that it was impossible. That there was no way in hell. That just the simple thought of it made him sick and it all had to be just a horrible joke.</p><p>Well, the one thing Taiga was sure of, was that people change.</p><p>Sometimes it just takes something or someone to wander into a person's life to tear it apart before they're pieced together in a different shape.</p><p>Hokuto had certainly shattered him.</p><p>But Hokuto also assembled the shards.</p><p>And Taiga would let him do it again and again.</p><p>"Hokuto…"</p><p>Taiga breathed his name as he reached up, slipping his fingers behind Hokuto's neck to lead him down, whispering against the lips he had admired and the moles that seemed to perfectly decorate them.</p><p>"I want you to hold me…"</p><p>Hokuto's breath hitched, his blood raced through his veins.</p><p>"A-are you sure–? You haven't-… before. I haven't–" Hokuto stumbled on his words while Taiga pressed warm kisses to the corners of his lips.</p><p>Hokuto thought his heart would explode.</p><p>It felt like their roles had suddenly reversed. Out of either of them to be charging forward, Hokuto would have thought it would be himself.</p><p>He guessed he should have known that if anyone were to break the outlines of what he had refined for years, Taiga would be the one to do it.</p><p>Hokuto closed his eyes as Taiga shook his head, taking Hokuto's face into his hands.</p><p>"It's okay…" he breathed into their kiss.</p><p>"Break me…"</p><p>"Just promise me you'll put me back together when we're done."</p><p>… Amazing…</p><p>It was amazing how much better sex was when it was with someone he loved and they loved him too…</p><p>The whole time, Hokuto thought his heart would burst. </p><p>And it did. Over and over again as he drank from Taiga's heat.</p><p>Taiga clung to him, sweat beading on his skin with his nails digging into Hokuto's back as his name spilled from his lips and his voice sang. Tears fell from his eyes as he gasped and begged for Hokuto's kiss. </p><p>"I love you–" he panted between their lips.</p><p>"Hokuto– I love you so much–"</p><p>Hokuto's heart was overflowing.</p><p>He never knew he could ever love so deeply.</p><p>"I love you." </p><p>Hokuto's voice almost shook, his words nearly desperate as his chest burst, clutching Taiga in his hold. </p><p>"I love you more than anything."</p><p>He repeated, tears stinging his eyes as he swallowed Taiga's breath.</p><p>"I love you."</p><p>"I love you…"</p><p>Hokuto could say it thousands of times and it would never be enough. Every kiss they had and would have would never come close. </p><p>He hoped he had his whole life to show him.</p><p>After their heavy breaths had calmed and their heated skin had cooled, they entangled themselves with each other, taking the embrace they could only dream of during their years apart, when all they could do was deny, regret, and give up on ever feeling that warmth again, but knowing it would be a memory that would never escape them.</p><p>Hokuto pulled his covers over them before wrapping Taiga in his arms, burying his nose into his soft hair with his lips brushed against the back of Taiga's neck as he whispered words he wished he could have said sooner into his skin. </p><p>Taiga took a hand from his waist, folding his fingers with it before setting them against his chest and feeling the heat from Hokuto’s skin set into his heart. </p><p>There were many things that were left to be said and to be spoken. About Hinako and their relationship. The rain. The book. Their future. Their present. </p><p>Three years was a long time and the stories they could tell were endless, but as they fell asleep with their hearts in sync for the first time, they both knew that they had each other for tomorrow.</p><p> </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><p dir="ltr"><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>There were only the soft sounds of shifting sheets and fabric in response to the beeping alarm as Taiga began to stir. </p><p>His squinting eyes cracked open, regretting the morning while the beeping persisted. </p><p>It was 6:00 am. </p><p>It had to be. </p><p>He knew, because it was the time Hokuto's alarm always went off in the morning.</p><p>"... Hokuto…" Taiga muttered, his vocals cracking from the early morning. "... Wake up…"</p><p>"... Hey."</p><p>Hokuto was awake. </p><p>Taiga could tell by the squeeze that tightened around his middle. </p><p>He reached behind him to tap the back of his fingers against the warm cheek that was set in the crook of his neck. </p><p>"At least turn off your alarm…"</p><p>As Hokuto rolled back to stretch his arm out behind him to tap at the screen of his phone set on Taiga's bedside table, Taiga couldn't keep back the smile that cracked at the corner of his lips at the other arm that refused to unhook itself from under his waist. </p><p>When Hokuto returned to curl back into his boyfriend, he found himself meeting Taiga's chest as Taiga turned himself to face him, slipping his arm under Hokuto's head while the other laid across Hokuto's shoulder to thread its hand into his dark waved hair. </p><p>This is why Hokuto refused to leave Taiga’s side in the mornings. </p><p>Even after weeks of dating, Taiga wasn’t really one for public displays of affection, or even displays of affection in private. Either of them were rare and far between, but every morning and night Taiga did all and more, making sure the moment they were ready to rest, their limbs were tangled with each other’s before sleep. </p><p>It didn’t matter whether Taiga woke him up with an "I love you" or a kiss, these mornings were more than enough. </p><p>"Good morning," Hokuto whispered, smiling into Taiga’s collar. </p><p>Taiga just replied with a soft hum, hooking Hokuto’s head under his chin. </p><p>"Taiga?..."</p><p>Another questioning hum vibrated in Taiga’s throat.</p><p>"... I love you."</p><p>Hokuto knew to not expect a mirrored response as he rarely got one, usually only ever receiving silence or a just a tightened hold, but that just made the small replies feel like a blessing as Taiga nuzzled himself into the mess of his hair and muttered back.</p><p>"Y' too…"</p><p>Hokuto didn’t need the full words to know. </p><p>This was just how Kyomoto Taiga said "I love you too."</p><p>Taiga’s language wasn’t one that was hard to learn, it just took a little time to understand. </p><p>Hokuto smiled and pressed a kiss against the base of Taiga's neck, waiting for Taiga's breath to even again as he got his fill of the scent of his skin before carefully untangling himself from him to stop his next alarm from disrupting Taiga's peaceful sleep again.</p><p>6 am was when Hokuto usually rose, but besides a morning rinse and preparing breakfast, there was something else he wanted to be ready to disrupt in the early morning.</p><p>… Well, someone. </p><p>At around 8 am, Taiga’s doorbell would ring. </p><p>Today was no exception.</p><p>"Oh! Hey! Good morning! I wasn't expecting to see you again, Hokuto."</p><p>Hokuto hoped that the other wouldn't recognize his forced smile.</p><p>"... Good morning, Juri."</p><p>He stepped back as Juri beamed before yawning, giving Hokuto's shoulder a hefty pat as he came in. </p><p>"Is Kyomo awake?"</p><p>Maybe if Juri didn't arrive so early, he wouldn't have to ask this question.</p><p>"No, he's–"</p><p>"I'm awake."</p><p>They both turned to the voice behind Hokuto to see the sleep-disheveled Taiga entering the bathroom to wash up as quickly as he left his room, giving no mind to the extra person in his home. </p><p>They watched the bathroom door close before Juri only laughed, throwing his coat over the back of Taiga's couch, showing he wasn't here to just drop something off.</p><p>"So you're making breakfast?"</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Hokuto had gotten to know this pattern well enough to make enough for breakfast for 3.</p><p>At least today he was able to get Juri up on his feet to prepare the rice for their meal instead of just sitting on the couch and simply waiting for his fresh coffee as he often did.</p><p>When Taiga stepped out of the bathroom, he saw the two of them already well into their morning conversation which somehow became relatively routine.</p><p>"She's not mad?" Hokuto asked as he filled Juri's mug.</p><p>"Nah, we've just about got it figured out. Work already wakes me up early but the little one is the only reason why I'm able to stay awake. I'm with her in the morning and then we trade off before I leave."</p><p>"You don't need to stick around longer to help?..."</p><p>"Ahh well, I pay the rest of my dues at night."</p><p>"Do you really?..."</p><p>"... As much as I can–"</p><p>"Good morning."</p><p>The two of them looked over to the now completely awake Taiga entering the kitchen, Juri giving a bright grin and Hokuto giving his own warm smile as he turned back to the stove.</p><p>"Good morning, Kyomo. Are you ready to eat?"</p><p>Hokuto felt as if his line was stolen as Taiga nodded, sitting in his chair beside Juri.</p><p>"So, how is the writing going?" Juri said, setting his chin in his palm while sliding Taiga's serving of rice over to him.</p><p>"It's a slow start but I have plenty of ideas." Taiga took it before Hokuto handed him his bowl and plate with his breakfast. "At this point, it's just getting it on paper, but I know where it's going."</p><p>Juri didn't notice how Hokuto's fingers lingered over Taiga's as Hokuto passed him his bowl.</p><p>Frankly, Taiga didn't notice either, but Hokuto had grown used to it, keeping those moments to himself even if they weren't completely reciprocated.</p><p>The clock caught the corner of Taiga's eye as he brought his bowl up to his lips. </p><p>"Ah. Hokuto, it's already 8:26. Don't you have to get going?"</p><p>Hokuto blinked, checking his watch while he pulled his apron from his neck.</p><p>"Shit. You're right," Hokuto said, quickly making his way back to the bedroom to collect his things, but not without tapping his hand on Taiga's back as he passed by. "Thank you."</p><p>Taiga didn't bother responding to Hokuto's gratitude considering Hokuto was already long gone before he has a chance, but when he set his bowl down, he felt a set of staring eyes boring into his side. </p><p>He sighed, he swatting away Juri's nudging elbow.</p><p>"You guys have only been together for a few weeks and you're already in some kind of domestic bliss?" Juri chuckled, withdrawing his arm to himself.</p><p>Well, with the emotional rollercoaster it took to get here, things had better be going well or Taiga may have gone insane, but calling it something so cheesy as 'domestic bliss' made shivers crawl up his spine. </p><p>Taiga was happy, but he wasn't ready to admit that these were some of the happiest days of his life. </p><p>"Shut it. Just eat the breakfast Hokuto went through the trouble of making you," he said, shoveling a large bite of rice into his mouth and ignoring Juri's question.</p><p>Juri just smiled and ate some of his fish before responding with one last tease.</p><p>"Yes, <em> sir</em>."</p><p>A few bites later, the sound of the bedroom door closing got Taiga onto his feet to help lock the door behind Hokuto.</p><p>"How late do you work tonight?" Taiga asked with his cheeks still full of his food.</p><p>Hokuto threw his bag across his body before he leaned over to fasten his shoes. "We're doing some prep tonight so it may be late. I'll probably be back before you sleep, but will it be okay if I use your shower that late? Will it wake you up?"</p><p>Taiga frowned as he crossed his arms. "Why don't you just stay at your own place if you're going to be so late?"</p><p>"Is wanting to see you good enough of a reason?"</p><p>Deep inside Taiga knew the real answer to Hokuto's question, but his impulse replied first. Sure, they were happily dating, but people could only change so fast and Hokuto's words were still just as embarrassing as they had been nearly a month ago. </p><p>"No." Taiga answered quickly to save himself from the flush that wanted to settle in his cheeks. "Just get out of here already."</p><p>Hokuto just smiled, letting Taiga push him out the front door before turning to face him through the frame. </p><p>"Will you come for lunch today? Jesse made creme brulee for this week. I'll save you one if you are."</p><p>Taiga hated how Hokuto knew sweets were his weakness, especially when they were filled with cream.</p><p>He pulled the door half closed. "... I'll think about it."</p><p>Despite his deflecting words, Hokuto watched Taiga's eyes lower to his lips, making him unable to hold back a smile. </p><p>Hokuto placed his hand on the handle on the other side of the door to lean in. </p><p>"Just text me, okay?"</p><p>Even with his disapproving frown, Taiga still raised his chin to catch Hokuto's cheek and accept his wordlessly requested kiss.</p><p>"I'm leaving now."</p><p>Taiga dropped his hand to Hokuto's chest to push him away, sending him off to work with the words he told him each morning he left, ensuring Hokuto that he expected his return.</p><p>"Have a safe trip."</p><p>The door clicked shut and Taiga sighed, going back to his breakfast next to Juri who was unfortunately watching the whole time.</p><p>As much as Taiga wished to wipe the teasing grin Juri had off of his face, nothing could stop what would eventually spill from his lip. </p><p>"How long is it going to take you to get used to him saying stuff like that? It's already been more than a month," Juri laughed, pushing his last abandoned rolls of tamagoyaki over to Taiga.</p><p>Taiga just plucked one off of Juri's plate and chomped down on it with his teeth, cutting the expertly crafted fluffy texture.</p><p>"Forever, probably."</p><p>It wasn't the flirting that bothered him.</p><p>It was the fact that it <em> wasn't </em> flirting that bothered him.</p><p>Everything that Hokuto said was completely genuine and that only embarrassed him more.</p><p>Juri propped his elbow up on the counter and drank from his mug. "Does he flirt like that at work still? You don't mind at all?"</p><p>Taiga pulled the spine out of his fish.</p><p>"No, it doesn't. He doesn't do that anymore, anyway."</p><p>Juri blinked, leaning his chin against his knuckles. "He's not?"</p><p>"He works in the kitchen now. One cook wasn't enough and since he knows the menu better than anyone, decided they hired new waiters. </p><p>"I see," Juri smiled, warming his hands on his coffee before sighing. "It's kind of a shame that they don't have someone charming the customers any more. It sort of feels like an end of an era."</p><p>"Don't worry. There is."</p><p>When Juri looked over to Taiga, he was eating the last of his breakfast, finishing it off with the handmade pickled vegetables Hokuto served with the eggs.</p><p>"There is?..."</p><p>"They're people that Hokuto used to work with at his previous job. Apparently, they were about ready to quit anyway."</p><p>Juri hummed, fiddling with the spoon he used to mix the sugar into his coffee. "I see…"</p><p>Taiga glanced over at him, pulling his chopsticks from his lips</p><p>"... Are you curious?..."</p><p>Juri laughed, setting down his mug.</p><p>"... So… what are your lunch plans?"</p><p><br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
</p><p>"Welcome to Salut. How many people are in your party today?"</p><p>Juri almost had to squint as soon as he stepped into the restaurant behind Taiga.</p><p>The man before him was blinding.</p><p>If the world had been a cartoon, roses and sparkles would have bloomed around the man's image.</p><p>"I believe I've seen you before. You must have enjoyed the food, or maybe did you enjoy me?" the man said smoothly, his smile glimmering at the end of his sentence.</p><p>Taiga was already recoiling into himself as the man bowed to him.</p><p>"Uhh no. I–"</p><p>Juri could see Taiga's shoulders relax once Shintaro's voice boomed from the other side of the dining room.</p><p>"Kento!!"</p><p>"How many times do I have to tell you this isn't a host club!!!" Shintaro huffed, speeding over to him before shoving at Kento's shoulders, making Kento laugh. "You're lucky I don't tell Hokuto about this!" </p><p>Kento just chuckled, letting Shintaro yank the menus from his hands.</p><p>"Go ahead, tell him! It's all in good fun, right Kyomoto?"</p><p>Taiga gave a polite smile, unsure of how to respond to Kento's playful wink. "Yeah… sure."</p><p>"Go refill some waters or something! Jeezus!!"</p><p>Juri just stood in shock, watching Shintaro briskly wave off Kento back into the restaurant while Taiga offered him a pitying smile when he turned back to them. </p><p>"... Things are going well, I see."</p><p>Shintaro let out a heavy sigh as he crossed his arms with menus still grasped in his hand. </p><p>"<em>Too </em> well, if you ask me. Kento and Fuma have a lot of experience and do a great job, but they're worse than Hokuto ever was! I get Hokuto was just trying to keep a customer base but our main attraction is still our food!"</p><p>"But business is good?" Taiga asked, following Shintaro's directing hand to the table that was set out for Taiga long ago, but was never taken out.</p><p>It was repurposed for a random overflow for many years, but when Taiga came back, it was cleared off for him again.</p><p>Taiga didn't really like how the designated spot drew attention and stirred up the whispers from the other guests about the author of <em> Silent Conversation </em> in his favorite restaurant, but it meant there was a table always waiting for him. </p><p>There was no amount of care he could have had for Hokuto or his food that would convince Taiga to stand in the line outside while others stared and gawked at him. </p><p>"Business is great! But my stress levels are higher than ever," Shintaro frowned, the wooden clipboard menu he set before Taiga clattering lightly against the tablecloth. "Our efficiency is fantastic and Kento and Fuma fit right in, but it feels like I'm spending all my time chasing them around, trying them to do work instead of playing 'who gets to have their ear whispered in by Kenty'. I just— Oh."</p><p>When Shintaro placed down Juri's menu, he looked up at him, only just then logging in his brain that there was another person besides Taiga who had heard him whining about his job. </p><p>He quickly flipped his casual switch to professional, grinning and laughing to cover for his preciously exerted frustrations.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, sir! I didn't mean for you to hear all of that! I can assure you this is a wonderful establishment with wonderful people who are all <em> very </em> happy to work here and have no complaints about their work or colleagues at all! Could you be a friend of Kyomoto's?"</p><p>Shintaro straightened out, giving a polite bow, making Juri laugh and wave his hand, excusing Shintaro's unserviceable behavior. </p><p>"It's okay, you can relax, I'm a friend of Hokuto and Kyomo, it's fine," Juri said while Shintaro's relief showed in his posture. "I can perfectly understand changes in work can be annoying sometimes."</p><p>Shintaro bowed again with his usual grin. "Thank you for being understanding, my good customer! Is there anything at all I can bring for you to drink?"</p><p>Juri shook his head and took the menu into his hands. "No, thank you, water is fine."</p><p>"Kyomoto?"</p><p>"Just water. Thanks, Shintaro." Taiga smiled as he pulled his phone out from his pocket. </p><p>"Oh, also congratulations on the full-time position."</p><p>Shintaro beamed. "Thanks! It was about time! Though it was really about when I finished school," he chuckled. "And thank you for the signed book, my mom was thrilled."</p><p>"It's nothing at all."</p><p>It really wasn't.</p><p>The hard part was done.</p><p>Drawing some scribbles that somehow resembled a name was easier than falling asleep, especially when all he had to do was pass it to Hokuto.</p><p>After Shintaro scurried away, Juri went to study the menu. His eyes nearly crossed trying to interpret the French named items before squinting to read the small words written underneath.</p><p>The menu was longer than he remembered. </p><p>Guess that's what happens when the staff is expanded.</p><p>The limited amount of refined dishes had expanded as well as including items considering dietary restrictions. </p><p>"Hey, Kyomo, what are you-"</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He had fully expected Taiga to be looking over the list as intently as he was, but his friend's hands were occupied with his phone rather than the clipboard menu before him. </p><p>"... Do you not want to eat?"</p><p>Taiga didn't bother looking up.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"Do you know what you want to eat?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then why aren't you looking at the menu."</p><p>Taiga just tucked his hair behind his ear and kept his smile to himself as he swiped his thumb over his screen. </p><p>"Don't worry about it, Juri."</p><p>When Shintaro returned, Juri was only confused more when Shintaro took Taiga's untouched menu without question after setting a creme brulee before him.</p><p>"So, do you know what you would like to order?"</p><p>Juri was so baffled that he had already forgotten what he was contemplating.</p><p>He chuckled awkwardly, handing Shintaro the clipboard. "Uhh… I'll just have the same thing as Kyomo, thanks."</p><p>"Sure!" Shintaro grinned, shoving his blank order sheet into his apron pocket. "Holler if you need anything!"</p><p>Juri's smile dropped as soon as Shintaro turned his back, turning to see Taiga already breaking into the sugar crust of the brulee.</p><p>"Are you seriously eating dessert before dinner?"</p><p>Taiga scooped the brulee into his mouth, licking the sweet creme from his lips. "Yeah, why not?"</p><p>"Didn't your parents say that it ruins your appetite?" </p><p>"Yeah?" Taiga said, taking a spoonful and holding it out for Juri. "And aren't you the one who lived off of instant and convenient store food through college?"</p><p>Juri furrowed his brow, leaning forward and taking the spoon offered to him into his mouth, watching Taiga as he pulled it from his lips.</p><p>It was delicious and it nearly made Juri forget his argument, but he gratefully spread the cream over his tongue to savor the flavor before swallowing to speak and defend himself.</p><p>"I didn't have money then. That's called eating on a budget."</p><p>"No, that's called being lazy. You could have easily used your cafeteria credits or gone to a cheaper restaurant."</p><p>"Just give me another spoon."</p><p>Juri went through his bag, looking for Taiga's notebook before turning back, taking his second bite from Taiga's held-out spoon and placing the book on the table.</p><p>Just seeing the new notebook was refreshing for the both of them. </p><p>The last had been battered to bits with the corners of the binding and pages softened from being carelessly tossed from place to place. Even the brand name printed and embossed in gold paint had been worn away and smoothed to the point it was hard to tell it was ever there in the first place.</p><p>The new notebook felt like a new mindset, a clean slate that didn't carry the stress and anxiety from the last, filled with scribbled-out words and scratched-out ideas. Instead, each page was fresh and crisp, unmarked and unused for endless potential.</p><p>"So, I know you're gonna hate this, but Matsumoto did want me to ask if you were willing to write a romance novel again…" Juri said, clicking the end of the pen and handing it to Taiga.</p><p>Taiga opened the notebook, pleased by its neat notes that were written smoothly with Kochi's congratulatory pen. "From your tone, it sounds like you already know the answer."</p><p>Juri smiled, stealing the spoon to take a shard of the sugar crust. "I do, but I still have to do my job."</p><p>"Then you know it will be another 10 years before I consider it again."</p><p>Juri laughed, setting the spoon down on the saucer. "I'll let him know."</p><p>Taiga's new idea was a mystery again.</p><p>Honestly, after working on <em> Silent Conversation </em> for so long, he started to miss his previous genre. Writing exciting moments and pressured meetings was enticing and he always loved hearing his editors gasp as they were reading. </p><p>This time, it was just going to be less dark. He had to change it up somehow. If he wrote a mirror of his first series, it'd never sell.</p><p>Right now, his idea was to have the mystery plot hidden under the main character's occupation of painting family portraits of those with recently deceased to aid their grief.</p><p>Maybe it needed some adjustment, but for now, Taiga just wrote what came to mind.</p><p>It felt amazing to have the words flow back to him with ease again. </p><p>"How's this?" Taiga asked, turning the notebook towards Juri who tilted his head to match the angle of the pages.</p><p>He put his hand over Taiga's to turn it towards him a little more, holding it as he read the neat bullet points Taiga wrote on the page.</p><p>"Hmm… Ohh… Very interesting. I think that's a great idea," Juri mused, tapping his chin with his free hand. "I feel like this would be more suited for later in the story, don't you think? You don't want to build up being too hasty."</p><p>"Oh, maybe. Let me-"</p><p>Taiga began to reach over to write a side note in the margins, but a plate intercepted their view, bringing them both to raise their heads to the person who held it.</p><p>"Pardon me, sirs. Here is your lunch."</p><p>Taiga withdrew his pen.</p><p>"... Ah. Hokuto."</p><p>Hokuto just smiled at Taiga, waiting for the both of them to remove Taiga's notes and their hands from the center of the table.</p><p>"Two tomato a la provencale, correct?"</p><p>Juri had no idea what he had ordered, but he could only assume it was correct by the fact that there were two of the same, so he just nodded.</p><p>He should have known it would have tomatoes, but he couldn't say he remembered anything primarily featuring tomatoes on the menu.</p><p>"I thought you were done with the waiting, Hokuto," Juri smiled as his lunch was set in front of him. "That's what Kyomo told me this morning."</p><p>"No, that's still correct," Hokuto said, putting down Taiga's plate in its place. "I don't serve anymore."</p><p>Juri laughed, trying to make fun of the situation. "But here you are, still bringing us our food."</p><p>"That's because I got word that our esteemed patron Kyomoto Taiga was here. I had to come by and give my greeting and thanks for what you've done for our restaurant," Hokuto smiled as he stepped back, giving them both a polite bow while Taiga cut into his food, not paying much mind to Hokuto's sudden formality.</p><p>"It's nothing at all," Taiga responded anyway.</p><p>"My staff also informed me that there were whispers about his boyfriend arriving with him today."</p><p>Ah. Juri understood now.</p><p>Hokuto was pissed.</p><p>"With all due respect, sir, I can assure you that my friend and I are nothing but friends," Juri explained with the same polite smile.</p><p>He was telling Hokuto what he already knew, but it didn't manage to make Hokuto relax as Hokuto crossed his arm, straightening his back and gave a laugh they both knew was fake.</p><p>"I see. Then what the other customers believed was flirting were just things friends do? The feeding each other and such?"</p><p>"Well, I–"</p><p>Juri paused.</p><p>Honestly, he had never thought about it. </p><p>He guessed maybe the things he did with Taiga were a little more intimate than what two male friends usually did, but was there anything wrong with that? He was only a few months away from finally getting married and Taiga was currently in an unexpectedly stable relationship. There shouldn't be any misunderstanding. </p><p>Also, it wasn't like Taiga wasn't encouraging it.</p><p>"Come on, Hokuto. You know I'm engaged."</p><p>"That doesn't matter."</p><p>"I just want to let you know that Kyomo was the one who held out the spoon. I didn't ask for it." Juri held out his hand, presenting the man in question who was eating peacefully across from him.</p><p>Hokuto's service smile fell before he sighed.</p><p>"You know he doesn't know any better. And you still accept the spoon."</p><p>"Okay, sure but–"</p><p>They both bit their tongues when the clink of Taiga's silverware cut into their trivial argument, pulling them both to look over to him and watch him wipe his mouth on his napkin. </p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p>Juri and Hokuto froze like children getting caught by their teacher before Hokuto spoke up.</p><p>"... Yes?"</p><p>Taiga stood from his chair. "Will you come with me for a moment?"</p><p>"To where?... Wait, Taiga. Where are you–"</p><p>Taiga didn't wait to answer Hokuto's question as he walked past him towards the back of the restaurant, Hokuto following quickly after him and leaving Juri alone with his vegetable-heavy dish.</p><p>Juri stared down at it, contemplating the rich deep reds of the roasted fruit-vegetables before remembering the words of his dear mother.</p><p>She was right…</p><p>Eating dessert beforehand did ruin his appetite.</p><p>Juri stood up, seeing the eyes of other customers hiding away as he looked over the other tables that must have been watching this whole time.</p><p>He guessed there was no better time to have a smoke. It was better than sitting alone with the curious eyes that peeked over at him.</p><p>As he sat down in the small garden at the end of the alley, lighting his cigarette alone, he laughed to himself as the burn at the end bloomed. </p><p>"... I guess that could have been me, huh?"</p><p>He filled his lungs with smoke.</p><p>No.</p><p>It had to be Hokuto.</p><p>The only person who could ever truly teach Taiga was always going to be Hokuto.</p><p>Just as the only person who could save Hokuto was always going to be Taiga.</p><p>While the end of Juri's cigarette burned between his lips, the "where" Taiga took Hokuto was the backroom storage to which he closed the door to after Hokuto walked in. </p><p>Taiga sighed, shutting the door with his back by leaning against it.</p><p>"What's going on between you and Juri? Every time you guys are together, things seem to get tense."</p><p>"I'm just telling him what I heard," Hokuto said with his back turned to him as he busied himself with aimlessly pushing boxes of produce around the small steel table. "Fuma came in laughing so hard that the women Kento was serving were so distracted by the two of you they wouldn't even look up at him. Do you understand what that means?"</p><p>"No. I don't." Taiga's eyebrows furrowed. "What we do is none of their business. Isn't it their fault for gawking at other people? How is it my or Juri's fault?"</p><p>"Do you not understand why they were watching you two?"</p><p>"Not really. We were just acting as we always do."</p><p>That was a problem in itself, but Hokuto stayed on topic.</p><p>"Taiga, you were feeding him."</p><p>"I was just sharing."</p><p>"That's not what normal people do when they share food."</p><p>"Is it not? Don't you do that with me all the time?"</p><p>Taiga wasn't getting it.</p><p>Taiga's cluelessness was part of what made him adorable, but when it came to Juri, Hokuto couldn't help but feel an irritation flare up in his stomach. </p><p>"It's not about that," Hokuto sighed heavily as he dropped his weight onto the side of the table.</p><p>"Taiga, how many times have you done something like that with me?"</p><p>Taiga's brow raised, his head tilting slightly in confusion. "Did I just say that you-"</p><p>"Not me, Taiga. You."</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>Hokuto swore he could see the gears turning in Taiga's head. </p><p>He wasn't really sure what was going to come next. </p><p>He mostly expected Taiga to apologize to end the argument without really knowing why he was apologizing, but it was possible Taiga would fight back, refusing to believe he did anything wrong.</p><p>Hokuto understood a lot more about Taiga since they started dating, but no one could truly ever understand everything about someone without being inside their mind.</p><p>"Hokuto?..."</p><p>Whichever way Taiga reacted, he could handle it, right?</p><p>"Are you-…"</p><p>"... Are you jealous?..."</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>Hokuto felt his face instantly begin to burn. </p><p>Even though that wasn't the point Hokuto was trying to make, he cheeks turned visibly red in the dimly lit storage room. He just was trying to make Taiga realize what these gestures could be perceived while in public, but somehow, Taiga had seen deeper into his own heart that Hokuto had even realized himself. </p><p>As Taiga watched Hokuto cover his face with his hand and wrist, his heart squeezed. </p><p>It was hard to believe that this was the same man from all those years ago. </p><p>So long ago, this man had pulled him in by the waist and challenged his doubts about love without hesitation, the same one who followed him and insisted that love was all worth something.</p><p>Somehow, that same man who flirted with every woman in his own restaurant was now jealous over his boyfriend just because of some stupid gossip between friends.</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but smile, his chest heating with a mix of embarrassment and adoration.</p><p>It was incredible how much things could change.</p><p>But Hokuto wasn't the only one who had changed.</p><p>Taiga was different too.</p><p>It might have been slow, but he was learning.</p><p>He sat next to Hokuto on the table, leaning over to see him turn his face away from him as he slid closer, just until their shoulders bumped.</p><p>"... Do you want me to start feeding you too-?"</p><p>"No, it's not about that."</p><p>"Then what can I do?..."</p><p>It was hard to stay mad when Taiga was so earnestly trying.</p><p>Hokuto dropped his hands into his lap, sighing. </p><p>"Can you just… not do these things with Juri?"</p><p>"Only Juri?</p><p>"Only because I know you were in love with him once…"</p><p>That wasn't really true, but this wasn't exactly the appropriate time to try to clarify exactly what Juri was to Taiga back then. </p><p>"... You know he's getting married next month, right?"</p><p>"I know but you can do all these things with him that you don't even do with me. It's sometimes hard to believe that I'm the one you're actually with…"</p><p>Taiga laughed. "I can try to do it if you want–"</p><p>"No, I told you. That's not the point…" Hokuto said, using the excuse of pushing his fingers into his temple to hide his face. </p><p>"... Just promise me you won't fall in love with him again…"</p><p>Taiga smiled a little to himself as he looked at their feet.</p><p>"... No, that's impossible."</p><p>He knew it was impossible.</p><p>When Taiga had stolen a kiss from Juri for the first and last time, the only thing it told him was that he was completely in love with Hokuto. There was no spark or ache for a lost love, just a regret and realization that Hokuto's kiss was the only one that mattered, and that fact would never change. </p><p>Taiga had learned more at that moment from what he didn't feel more than anything else.</p><p>"... You know, I can do those things with Juri because it doesn't mean anything."</p><p>"But with you, it's embarrassing."</p><p>Hokuto looked over at Taiga beside him, seeing his timid smile and staying silent for him to continue.</p><p>"If it's with you, I just imagine how you would look straight at me and not at the food. You would look at me like– you know." Taiga waved his hands, making some nebulas form of what he was trying to describe.</p><p>"It's embarrassing."</p><p>"But if it really bothers you, I can try to do more stuff like that or I don't know, I can–"</p><p>Taiga stopped when he felt Hokuto's head on his shoulder and his nose bury into his clothes. He let the rest of his words release as a breath while Hokuto slipped his hand under his to threaded their fingers loosely together.</p><p>He stayed quiet for a moment, letting the smell of his own shampoo in Hokuto's hair fill his nose before muttering into his dark hair.</p><p>"... Juri isn't the one who sleeps next to me at night."</p><p>"Juri doesn't cook for me every morning."</p><p>"Juri doesn't say 'I'm home' or 'I'm leaving' when he comes and goes."</p><p>"Only you."</p><p>Hokuto's fingers tightened around Taiga's as the room fell silent aside from the distant humming of chatter and the clatter and clink of plates and silverware behind the door.</p><p>Without words, they knew their hearts were in the same place. </p><p>"Taiga?..."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Can I kiss you?"</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but laugh, bumping his temple against Hokuto's head before Hokuto moved away to stand before him, cupping his cheek to lift his chin up towards him. </p><p>"You already know the answer without me saying, don't you?"</p><p>Hokuto mirrored his smile as Taiga slipped his fingers under the tie of Hokuto's apron to pull him closer.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Taiga let out an airy chuckle while Hokuto lowered his head to press his lips against his to feel the touch that set his heart ablaze time and time again, and when Hokuto began to pull back, Taiga craned his neck, chasing for another to which Hokuto happily surrendered to. </p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What did you do with true love? </p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… Honestly, neither of them still didn't know. </p><p>Love was a fickle thing and behaved in strange ways. </p><p>It could shatter your heart and reduce you to tears before making it soar and bringing you to cloud nine. </p><p>Love wasn't smooth sailing like in fairy tales where everything finished "happily ever after" and wrapped with a neat bow. No matter how much they knew they had each other's hearts, it didn't always mean that things would be picture-perfect.</p><p>But every small bump on their path made every loving moment worth even more.</p><p>Taiga let out a pleased hum as Hokuto caught his lip between his own and tilted Taiga's chin up with his knuckles to take another kiss. </p><p>They were nearly completely lost in their own world, Taiga tugging Hokuto closer by his apron with Hokuto running his fingers along the back of Taiga's ear and into his hair until a knock pounded on the door, making them both nearly jump.</p><p>Taiga laughed quietly into Hokuto's collar as Hokuto folded a protective arm around and over his shoulders. Taiga clutched his hands into Hokuto's uniform, just as embarrassed as he was surprised, hearing Hokuto's heart racing in his chest as fast as his own while Hokuto called back to the door in a loud voice.</p><p>"Yes??"</p><p>Jesse's voice called back.</p><p>"Hokuto? I won't ask what's going on, but I want to tell you the orders are piling up. I'll need you back here pretty soon!"</p><p>"Ah, okay! I'll be there soon!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>They both waited until they heard the squeak and thump of the kitchen door closing before their shoulder relaxed, Hokuto releasing a sigh of relief while Taiga drew away from his chest. </p><p>"Back to work?" Taiga asked, fixing the tie on Hokuto's uniform he had pulled from its neat place around his waist.</p><p>"Unfortunately, but let me fill up before I go."</p><p>Taiga squeezed his eyes shut as Hokuto placed chaste kisses over his forehead, cheek and neck, getting his serving of his own boyfriend before he had to send him back to his editor.</p><p>When Hokuto finished with a last kiss on Taiga's lips, Taiga extended it, holding the sides of Hokuto's neck to make him stay for just a moment longer. </p><p>People say that commutation is important in a relationship, Hokuto and Taiga knew that better than anyone.</p><p>So even if they knew, they made sure to say it.</p><p>Hokuto grinned, tapping his head to Taiga's, knowing his time was running out.</p><p>"I love you."</p><p>Taiga chuckled, holding Hokuto's cheek, already anticipating when Hokuto would return to his door again tonight.</p><p>When tonight, like every night, Hokuto would show him exactly what to do with true love. </p><p>"I love you too."</p>
