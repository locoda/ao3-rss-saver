</p><p>Yugo squats by the Lego bin, chubby fingers clutching yellow blocks. Juri watches from across the room, the five-year-old calculating the best approach. He sucks in a breath and walks over.</p><p>“Yugo, can I have some yellow ones?” Juri’s voice wavers, uncertain.</p><p>“No, they’re mine,” Yugo responds without looking up. His hands keep moving, building.</p><p>“But Yamazaki-sensei says we share,” Juri retorts, eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>Yugo looks up then, his eyes fierce. “I like yellow. They’re mine.”</p><p>In response, Juri reaches out, snatching a block from Yugo’s pile. It’s a desperate, bold move.</p><p>“Hey!” Yugo yells, leaping to his feet.</p><p>In a second, it escalates. The air fills with the sound of flying Legos, shouts, and indignant cries.</p><p>“Yugo! Juri!” Yamazaki-sensei’s stern voice cuts through the chaos. She pulls the two apart, guiding them each to a separate corner. “No Legos for you two for a week.”</p><p>Juri’s heart sinks. He watches as Yugo sticks out his tongue, the victory bittersweet.</p><p>After school, frustration churns in Juri’s little chest. He kicks at the pavement as he walks with his Mom.</p><p>“Yugo took all the yellow Legos, Mom!” he exclaims. His hands clench at his sides, the injustice of it all weighing heavy.</p><p>His mom looks down, confusion knitting her brows together. “Who is Yugo, sweetheart?”</p><p>He sighs, the world suddenly much too complicated for a kindergartener. “Just … someone who doesn’t know how to share.”</p><p>

</p><p>The wind whips through the field as Juri readies to throw the frisbee. Taiga and Shintaro stand at the ready.</p><p>“Here it comes!” Juri shouts, releasing the disc.</p><p>But the wind has its own plans. The frisbee arcs, veers, and then—</p><p>“Ow!” Yugo cries out, the frisbee hitting him square in the face. Hokuto stands beside him, eyes wide.</p><p>“Oh no,” Juri gasps, and he, Taiga, and Shintaro rush over. “I’m sorry, Yugo,” he blurts out, a blush creeping his cheeks.</p><p>Yugo glares at him, rubbing his cheek. “Who threw it?” he demands.</p><p>The question hangs heavy. Silence thickens around them. All eyes are on Juri.</p><p>Yugo’s gaze hardens. He bends down, picks up the frisbee, and throws it at Juri. “Doesn’t feel good, does it?” he snarls, his sarcasm cutting like a blade.</p><p>Taiga snickers, but quickly stops when he meets Yugo’s gaze. “Sorry,” he mumbles, unable to hide his grin.</p><p>Just then, a teacher arrives, her eyes darting between Yugo and the frisbee. Yugo is led away, leaving Juri with a knot of worry in his stomach.</p><p>Yugo doesn’t return to class. Juri stares at the empty seat, anxiety gnawing at him. He finds himself wondering, “Does Yugo hate me now?” His mind spins, caught in a whirlwind of regret and fear.</p><p>

</p><p>The hum of computers fills the lab, the fluorescents casting an artificial glow. Juri and Yugo sit side by side in a scene that’s eerily familiar. They haven’t spoken since a frisbee and a gust of wind wedged a rift between them five years ago.</p><p>Juri’s gaze flits to Taiga across the room. “Wish we could choose partners,” he mumbles.</p><p>“I wish I had Hokuto. He’s smart,” Yugo responds, not bothering to lower his voice.</p><p>Juri bristles. “What, you don’t think I’m smart?”</p><p>Yugo looks at him, a smirk playing on his lips. “Smarter than a frisbee?”</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” Juri retorts, his voice stiff.</p><p>Yugo merely shrugs, turning to the assignment on their screen. It’s about interviewing the dance team and writing an article.</p><p>“My friends are in the dance team. I could talk to them during practice,” Juri suggests.</p><p>“But we have to do it together,” Yugo insists. “I swear, get a brain cell and work with me here.”</p><p>Juri suddenly spins to face Yugo. “You’re mean. Even when we were kids, you never shared your yellow Legos.”</p><p>Yugo throws his hands up, exasperation etched onto his face. “That was preschool, Juri!”</p><p>Juri bites his lip, realizing the absurdity of his accusation. Still, the frustration radiating from Yugo feels familiar. <em>This is going to be a tough semester</em>.</p><p>
  <br/>

</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>Juri’s peaceful slumber shatters  as his phone buzzes loudly. Rubbing his groggy eyes, he glances at the notification. “Sworn Enemy,” it reads. A sigh escapes him as he unlocks the phone and skims Yugo’s lengthy message.</p><p>“Dance practice Friday is canceled,” he mumbles, the words swimming before his eyes.</p><p>Instead, a dance meet in another town on Saturday. An interview afterward. An entire day gone.</p><p>“What?!” Juri sits up, awake now. His fingers fly across the screen. “Yugo, that’s an entire day! In another town!”</p><p>Yugo has an answer ready. “We’ll ride with them. Save time.”</p><p>“But it’s still the whole day,” Juri fires back, frustration mounting.</p><p>“It is what it is, Tanaka,” Yugo replies.</p><p>Juri’s screen lights up with another message, Yugo adding, “We’re partners. We have to go together.”</p><p>Juri huffs, letting his phone fall on his chest. He stares at the ceiling, wrestling with the inevitable. Yugo is right. They’re partners, and they have to see this through.</p><p>“Alright,” he texts back. “I’ll be there.”</p><p>He sets down his phone and rolls over. <em>This is going to be a long weekend</em>.</p><p>

</p><p>The hum of the bus engine is a low, constant rumble under the chitter-chatter. Juri huddles in a seat with Taiga and Shintaro. Across the aisle, Yugo sits alone, his demeanor calm amid the bustle.</p><p>“Thank god you guys are here,” Juri whispers. He steals a glance at Yugo, who’s engrossed in a book.</p><p>“Poor Juri,” Taiga drawls, nudging Juri with his elbow. “Stuck with Kochi Yugo for a partner.”</p><p>Shintaro adds fuel to the fire. “I think Yugo’s cute,” he says, winking at Juri.</p><p>Juri huffs, cheeks reddening. “Stop thinking about my nemesis like that, Shin.”</p><p>Taiga snorts. “I thought <em>you</em> said Hokuto’s cute.”</p><p>They all laugh, the tension easing, but Juri can’t help his thoughts from straying back to Yugo. His stubbornness. His refusal to share the yellow Legos back in preschool.</p><p>Sitting on the bus, surrounded by friends yet mentally locked in battle with Yugo, Juri thinks, <em>This is going to be a long ride</em>.</p><p>

</p><p>The high school dance meet buzzes with energy, bodies moving, music pulsing. Juri sticks with Taiga and Shintaro until they get called for their performance.</p><p>Left alone, Juri climbs the bleachers, his Nintendo DS in hand. A little Pokémon never hurt anyone, he thinks, losing himself in the digital world.</p><p>A shadow falls over him, the figure blocking the overhead lights. It’s Yugo.</p><p>“Still playing Pokémon?” Yugo quips.</p><p>Juri rolls his eyes. “Better than standing alone,” he retorts, more out of reflex than intent.</p><p>They sit in silence, the noise of the meet humming around them. Juri, attempting to redirect the conversation, turns the topic to their unfinished assignment. “Got your interview questions ready?”</p><p>Yugo looks at him, surprise written all over his face. “I thought <em>you</em> were writing them.”</p><p>Neither of them had prepared. Great. “No,” Juri grumbles, frustration seeping into his words.</p><p>The gym’s noise heightens, Yugo standing up and lightly touching Juri’s arm. “Let’s find a quieter place to work.”</p><p>Juri flinches, the touch unwelcome. “Don’t touch me,” he snaps, brushing off Yugo’s hand.</p><p>
  <em>This is going to be a long night.</em>

</p><p>Juri notices Yugo’s pout as they settle into their desks. It’s been a week since Yugo’s been wearing this face, and Juri finds his mood both amusing and worrisome.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Sad about not seeing my face next semester?” Juri jokes, thinking of their upcoming schedule change.</p><p>Yugo shoots him a glare. That’s clearly not it.</p><p>“Is this about the frisbee incident?” he asks, chuckling. “I said I’m sorry, you know.”</p><p>Yugo shrugs him off. “Obviously no, Juri. That was five years ago.”</p><p>“Then what is it, Yugo?” Juri insists.</p><p>A long pause. Then Yugo murmurs, “Hokuto’s moving away.”</p><p>Juri stares, not expecting this. Hokuto and Yugo have been tight since forever. He’s not good with emotional stuff, but seeing Yugo upset stirs something in him.</p><p>“That’s rough,” he says, stumbling over words. “If you … if you feel lonely, you can sit with me at lunch.”</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow, seemingly surprised by the offer, and Juri wonders if he’s crossed some line. But then Yugo shrugs, and Juri takes that as a win.</p><p>Maybe they’ll be okay.</p><p>

</p><p>In Juri’s room, Taiga and Shintaro look at him in disbelief.</p><p>“Kochi Yugo? Lunch with us?” Shintaro echoes. “The Yugo who wouldn’t share his yellow Legos?”</p><p>“That’s the one,” Juri replies, shrugging. “Hokuto’s moving away, he shouldn’t be alone.”</p><p>Shintaro freezes. “Wait, Hokuto? Moving away?” He slumps dramatically onto Juri’s bed. “There goes my love life.”</p><p>Taiga turns to Juri. “Are you sure this is a good idea? It’s not like we’re friends with Yugo or anything.”</p><p>Juri sighs. “I know I’ve told you guys a lot of stuff about Yugo. Maybe I was too harsh.”</p><p>Taiga jumps on that. “Too harsh? He forgot to print your article last week and you said that you couldn’t believe god would allow such a useless human being to exist.”</p><p>Juri defends, “I was cranky that day.”</p><p>“Really, Juri?” Taiga throws up his hands in exasperation. “You’ve spent years complaining about him, and now you’re defending him?”</p><p>Juri shrugs. “Maybe he’s not that bad.”</p><p>Taiga groans, burying his face into a pillow. “This is going to be a disaster.”</p><p>Juri watches his friends’ reactions and wonders if he’s made the right choice. But deep down, he knows he has. They’ll understand eventually.</p><p>

</p><p>“Juri,” Yugo starts, tapping his pencil against the desk. “Promise me something?”</p><p>“Depends,” Juri responds, scanning his math notes.</p><p>“Don’t mention ‘college’ around me.” Yugo starts doodling on Juri’s paper.</p><p>Juri pushes him away. “Hey, I’m trying to work here,” he says. “What’s so bad about college?”</p><p>Yugo shrugs. “It’s stressful. Homework, expectations …”</p><p>“Sounds like now.”</p><p>“Yeah, but worse. My brother said midterms nearly killed him.”</p><p>Juri rolls his eyes. “You’re being dramatic, Yugo.”</p><p>Before Yugo can respond, his phone buzzes on the desk. He glances at the caller ID, then at Juri. “Watch, it’s probably my mom telling me my brother’s actually dead.”</p><p>Juri chuckles. “That would be a shame. He’s much nicer than you.”</p><p>Yugo shoves him. “Shut up,” he laughs, then picks up the call.</p><p>As Yugo talks on the phone, Juri finds himself grinning. He glances at Yugo, suddenly realizing that his old nemesis turned out to be a decent guy. It took them ten years and studying together, but he guesses some friendships just take longer to brew.</p><p>

</p><p>“Prom is so stupid,” Taiga grumbles, kicking a pebble along the sidewalk. “Why is our school trying to mimic American high schools anyway? Just for the sake of being edgy?”</p><p>Shintaro laughs. “You’re just mad because you’ve never felt butterflies for anyone outside your 2D waifus, Kyomoto.”</p><p>“Oh, and you have? Still pining over your unrequited love?” Taiga fires back.</p><p>“That’s Taiga for you,” Yugo interjects. “Classic ISTP. Unable to comprehend human emotions.”</p><p>“Juri, where’s Yugo’s off button?” Taiga turns to him.</p><p>“I’m not his boyfriend,” Juri blurts out, immediately regretting it. He feels his cheeks warm.</p><p>Yugo seems to shrug it off. “I don’t have an off button,” he mutters. “And if I did, I wouldn’t let Juri near it.”</p><p>“Especially not after the Lego incident.”</p><p>Laughter erupts from Shintaro and Taiga.</p><p>Juri thinks maybe he needs new friends, although the corners of his mouth lift. “You know, I don’t have anyone to go to prom with,” he finally admits.</p><p>“Yugo’s right there,” Shintaro teases, pointing to Yugo.</p><p>“Seriously though, why not go to prom, and if it’s boring, we’ll leave. At least we can say we tried,” Taiga suggests.</p><p>“Besides,” Shintaro chimes in, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Juri, you and Yugo could go together as dates, save on ticket costs.”</p><p>“Shut up, Shin!” Juri huffs, his face flushing, much to the amusement of his friends.</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <br/>
</p><p>“Juri,” Yugo begins, his voice sounding a bit strained. “Maybe we should buy the prom tickets together.”</p><p>Juri stops in his tracks, surprise evident on his face. Yugo’s ears turn a noticeable shade of red.</p><p>“You’re now agreeing with Shin’s advice?” Juri teases, trying to hide his surprise. “The same Shin who once advised us to throw water balloons at the principal?”</p><p>Yugo shrugs, managing a half-smile. “We don’t have to dance together or anything. We can just show up, as planned.”</p><p>Juri frowns, averse to the idea of prom and the crowd that comes with it. “I don’t know, Yugo … I’m not sure about the whole prom thing.”</p><p>Yugo looks at him. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Juri. I don’t want to regret not going.”</p><p>Juri lets out a sigh, looking at Yugo thoughtfully. “I’ll think about it,” he finally says, leaving Yugo with a faint smile.</p><p>

</p><p>In the school gym, now magically transformed for prom, Juri catches sight of Yugo. Dressed in a neatly tailored suit, Yugo looks strikingly handsome. A wave of attraction washes over Juri, which he tries to suppress.</p><p>“Wow, Juri,” Yugo breaks the silence, eyes raking over Juri’s figure, “You clean up good.”</p><p>Juri feels a warmth creeping up his neck. “Yeah, so do you.” He quickly deflects. “Though, I must admit, this whole thing makes me a bit anxious.”</p><p>They stand together, posing awkwardly for pictures before heading into the event floor. The dazzling lights and pulsating music engulf them. Yugo hands Juri a solo cup filled with Sprite, and they stand in a corner, taking in the scene.</p><p>The discomfort grows too tangible. After a while, they decide to leave. Walking Yugo home under the soft glow of the streetlights, Juri can’t help but blurt out, “You looked really good tonight, Yugo.”</p><p>Taken aback, Yugo’s face softens. He's about to say something when Juri, panicked, interrupts by leaning in, pressing a quick, clumsy kiss to Yugo’s lips.</p><p>They break apart, stunned. Then, Yugo, grinning widely, casually asks, “Wanna make out?”</p><p>Juri blinks, surprised, but then they’re leaning in again, and this kiss is nothing like the first one — it’s warm, genuine, filled with feelings they’ve been holding back for too long.</p><p>

</p><p>Yugo sprawls across the bed, watching as Juri doodles in his notebook. His gaze lands on Juri’s hands, fingers deftly maneuvering the pen. “You’ve got nice hands,” he declares, lips quirking up in a teasing smile.</p><p>Juri’s cheeks turn a soft pink. “Why, thank you, Yugo,” he responds, playing along. “I grew them myself.”</p><p>Yugo laughs, a warm, vibrant sound filling the room. “You know” — He pretends to pout — “You didn’t win me anything at the festival. Maybe I should date someone who’ll win me prizes.”</p><p>Juri raises an eyebrow, a small smirk playing on his lips. “So, that's all it takes, huh? Winning some cheap stuffed animal?”</p><p>Yugo shrugs, grinning. “Well, there’s something else you could do …”</p><p>Juri’s smile fades into uncertainty. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well …” Yugo hesitates before continuing. “We could … you know.”</p><p>Realization dawns on Juri. He chuckles awkwardly, cheeks burning. “Oh, right. That.”</p><p>“Yeah, that.” Yugo’s smile is a little forced, but his eyes are steady. “Only if you’re comfortable, of course.”</p><p>“I’ll think about it, Yugo,” Juri says after a moment. His heart is pounding, but he’s not entirely opposed to the idea.</p><p>“Better make up your mind soon,” Yugo playfully threatens, “Or I’ll find someone who’ll not only win me prizes but also—”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Juri interrupts, laughing. “I get it.”</p><p>Despite the playful exchange, Yugo’s eyes soften, reassuring. “No rush, okay? I’ll wait for you, Juri.”</p><p>Feeling a surge of affection, Juri sets his pen aside and moves closer. Yugo watches as Juri reaches out, cupping his cheek. “You know, Yugo,” Juri murmurs. “I think you talk too much.”</p><p>With that, he leans in, pressing a soft kiss to Yugo’s lips. Yugo responds instantly, arms winding around Juri’s neck as the kiss deepens. They break apart a moment later, foreheads resting against each other. Yugo’s eyes are sparkling, his lips stretched into a soft smile.</p><p>“Now, that’s more like it,” he teases, breathless and grinning.</p><p>

</p><p>Juri’s heart races as he stands in the aisle of the convenience store, staring at the condoms and lube in his basket. He swallows, feeling the blush creeping up his cheeks. He’s about to make his way to the checkout when a familiar voice rings out.</p><p>“Juri, is that you?”</p><p>He jumps, hastily shoving the basket behind his back. Taiga stands there, grinning broadly.</p><p>“Hey, Taiga,” he mumbles, willing his heart rate to calm down.</p><p>Taiga, quick and observant, spots the basket. He raises an eyebrow, amusement twinkling in his eyes. “Doing some shopping, are we?”</p><p>Juri’s face turns beet red. “I … uh …”</p><p>Taiga bursts into laughter, clapping him on the shoulder. “Finally decided to take the plunge with Yugo?”</p><p>“I … Yes,” Juri admits, squeezing the handle of the basket. “I thought it’s about time.”</p><p>“That’s my best friend!" Taiga gives a thumb up, grinning ear to ear. “Good for you!”</p><p>Juri shrugs, not quite able to meet his friend’s eyes. “I’m just … nervous, I guess.”</p><p>“Totally normal,” Taiga reassures. “First times are always a bit nerve-wracking. But you’ve got Yugo, and he’s a decent guy.”</p><p>“I know, I know. But still …”</p><p>Taiga chuckles. “Don’t overthink it. Just be safe and enjoy yourself.”</p><p>When Taiga has left and Juri is walking back to their dorm, his phone buzzes, a notification from their group chat.</p><p>Taiga had texted. “HELLO BREAKING NEWS JURI’S HAVING SEX WITH YUGO FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER”</p><p>Shintaro replies, “OOOOMMMGGGG LEMME HOW IT GOES ROMEO!”</p><p>“Damn it, Taiga!” Juri groans as he types a reply.</p><p>“I will absolutely not do that, thank you very much.”</p><p>

It’s a freezing winter day, but inside their apartment, the air burns with tension.</p><p>“What are you doing, Juri?” Yugo’s voice, strained and confused, cuts through the heavy silence.</p><p>“I’m leaving,” Juri says, his voice cold and firm.</p><p>“Leaving?” Yugo scoffs. “That’s immature.”</p><p>“I need a break, Yugo.” Juri’s voice shakes, mirroring his trembling hands. “And I don’t need your opinions on my decisions.”</p><p>“It’s not just about opinions, Juri!” Yugo exclaims. “You’re talking about dropping out of college!”</p><p>“Yes, I am!” Juri whirls around, fire in his eyes. “And you wouldn’t understand! All I hear is you worrying about splitting the rent, not understanding how I feel!”</p><p>Yugo’s mouth opens, then closes. He takes a step forward, reaching out. But Juri backs away, a clear warning in his eyes.</p><p>“Juri,” Yugo begins, his voice soft and pleading.</p><p>“No,” Juri interrupts him. “I’ve made up my mind.”</p><p>Yugo’s outstretched hand falls to his side. Juri can see the hurt flashing across his face, but he ignores it. He zips up his suitcase, standing up and walking towards the door.</p><p>“Juri, don’t.” Yugo’s voice follows him. “It’s freezing outside. At least take your coat.”</p><p>But Juri is already halfway out the door. He doesn’t turn back, doesn’t pick up his coat. The icy winter air bites at his skin as he steps outside, the suitcase heavy in his hand.</p><p>

</p><p>Juri lays on Taiga’s worn-out couch, staring at the ceiling. He’s been there for three days, stewing in his thoughts, his regrets. Outside, snow is falling, making the world quiet, like everything is on pause.</p><p>“Juri,” Taiga begins, his voice breaking the silence. “You can’t stay on my couch forever.”</p><p>“I know,” Juri mutters, turning on his side, away from Taiga.</p><p>“I could talk to Yugo for you,” Taiga offers, a hint of uncertainty in his voice.</p><p>Juri sits up, shaking his head. “No, it’s not your fight.” His heart aches at the mention of Yugo. He still loves him, despite everything. He misses him.</p><p>“Why do you love him?” Taiga asks, a curious lilt to his voice.</p><p>Juri hesitates. Why does he love Yugo? Images of Yugo fill his mind. Yugo, with his adorable smile, packing snacks for him before class. Yugo, not much of a cuddler, yet always playing with his fingers when they snuggled close. Yugo, the eternal volunteer, the one who cared too much, who always wanted to make others happy.</p><p>“He’s … he’s cute,” Juri finally admits, his face turning hot. “And he packs snacks for me before class. And … he cares a lot. Always trying to make people happy.”</p><p>Taiga chuckles. “Sounds like a keeper.”</p><p>Juri nods, silent. His eyes are watery, his eyes heavy.</p><p>“Don’t give up on him over one disagreement, Juri,” Taiga advises, his voice soft. “Work it out.”</p><p>Juri nods, sniffling a little. “Yeah … yeah, I’ll try.”</p><p>“And also,” Taiga adds, a smirk in his voice, “I want you off my couch.”</p><p>Juri laughs, a small, quiet sound, but it’s a start.</p><p>

</p><p>Juri paces in Taiga’s apartment, waiting for the pizza to arrive when a knock sounds at the door. His heart skips with anticipation for the comfort food. He swings the door open, already salivating, but freezes.</p><p>It’s Yugo. Not pizza.</p><p>Instinct kicks in. He abruptly shuts the door, retreating a step. Taiga looks up, alarmed. “Juri, what—?”</p><p>“Yugo,” Juri chokes out. He can barely process it.</p><p>“Well, don’t just stand there, open the door again,” Taiga insists, pushing past him.</p><p>Juri follows Taiga’s directive, revealing Yugo still standing there, now with a bemused expression. He holds out a wrapped present. “I brought this,” he mumbles.</p><p>Wordlessly, Juri takes the parcel, curiosity piqued. Unwrapping it reveals a yellow Lego building kit. There’s a note attached. He detaches it carefully and reads.</p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry, Juri. I should’ve respected your choices. I was wrong to push you. Your decisions are yours to make. - Yugo.</em>
</p><p>Yugo swallows visibly before speaking. “Juri, I … I miss you. Please come home.”</p><p>Juri feels something crack within him. He moves forward, hugging Yugo tightly. The response is immediate, Yugo’s arms wrapping him in warmth.</p><p>“I missed you too,” Juri says, his words muffled in Yugo’s jacket.</p><p>They share a moment, just holding each other in the cold. Their lips meet, the kiss an unspoken promise.</p><p>“Oi!” Taiga’s voice cuts through. “Can you two please make out somewhere else? I want to eat my pizza.”</p><p>Yugo grins, pulling back from Juri. “How about this? We split the pizza, and Juri and I will take the rest of our night elsewhere.”</p><p>Taiga nods, satisfied. “Deal.”</p><p>As Juri and Yugo prepare to leave, something feels right, as if the pieces of a puzzle are falling back into place.</p>
