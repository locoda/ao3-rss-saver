<div class="userstuff">
<p>Taiga settles into his seat as the anticipation builds in the darkened arena. The stage is backlit, instruments at the ready, waiting for the band to take the stage and fill the night with their soaring melodies. He’s practically buzzing with excitement, eager for the show to begin.</p><p>As he glances around at his fellow concertgoers, his eyes fall on the young man slouched in the seat directly to his right. He’s slumped down, arms crossed tightly over his chest, scowling at the empty stage like it’s done him a personal wrong. Delicate features peek out from beneath stylishly tousled dark hair.</p><p>He’d be cute if he didn’t look so utterly miserable.</p><p>Taiga hesitates for a second, then clears his throat. “Everything okay?”</p><p>The guy starts, head swiveling towards him, blinking in surprise. “What? Oh. Yeah, I’m fine.”</p><p>“You sure about that?” Taiga raises an eyebrow. “Because you look like you’re about to have all four wisdom teeth pulled without anesthesia.”</p><p>That startles a laugh out of him, transforming his face. Damn, he really is cute. “Do I? Sorry.” He sighs, shoulders slumping further. “I’m just … not really in a concert mood, I guess.”</p><p>Now Taiga’s intrigued. “Then why are you here? These tickets weren’t cheap, you know.”</p><p>“I’m aware,” he says dryly. “I bought mine off some reseller for an absurd amount. It was pretty much the last one available.”</p><p>Taiga stares at him in disbelief. “You paid that much just to sit here and wallow in misery? Why?”</p><p>He fidgets, color rising in his cheeks. “I bought it so my ex couldn’t,” he admits in a mumble.</p><p>“That’s … wow. That’s so …” Taiga fumbles for a non-judgmental response. “Petty?” he offers weakly.</p><p>“Pathetic,” he corrects with a self-deprecating little laugh. “You can say it. I’m well aware.”</p><p>“Well … maybe just a little,” Taiga allows, trying to suppress a smile. He really does look pitiful, hunched there in the dark. “I’m Kyomoto Taiga, by the way.”</p><p>“Matsumura Hokuto,” he replies, seeming to relax a fraction. “Sorry for being such a downer. I swear I’m not usually like this.”</p><p>“Bad breakup, huh?” Taiga ventures.</p><p>Hokuto groans, tipping his head back. “He dumped me. By text. Using the band’s lyrics.”</p><p>Taiga can’t help it — a shocked little giggle escapes him. “Sorry! That’s awful. Really. I’m not laughing at you, I swear.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” he sighs. “Objectively, it is pretty funny. Mort—”</p><p>His voice cracks, and he swallows hard.</p><p><em>Shit</em>.</p><p>“Hey,” Taiga says, more gently. “For what it’s worth, that guy sounds like a tool who never deserved you in the first place. Anyone who’d be that much of a coward isn’t worth your time.”</p><p>Hokuto eyes him sidelong through his hair. “You’re just trying to make me feel better.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs. “Maybe. Is it working?”</p><p>That earns him a tiny, barely-there smile. “A little. Thanks.”</p><p>“Anytime. Now, are you going to sit there moping all night, or are you going to get up and jam with me when the band comes out?” Taiga grins at him.</p><p>Hokuto hesitates, biting his lip. “I’d really rather not …”</p><p>“That was an order, not a request.” Taiga bounces to his feet and holds out a hand. “Let’s go, the show’s about to start!”</p><p>As if on cue, the first notes of the band’s opening number swell into the air. All around them, people leap up, cheering.</p><p>Taiga wiggles his fingers at Hokuto impatiently. “Come on, you’re going to miss it!”</p><p>Hokuto eyes his hand then slides his own into it with a put-upon sigh. Taiga tugs him upright just as the stage explodes with light and sound. The music pulses through Taiga, and he starts to move, lost in the beat.</p><p>After a stiff minute, he feels Hokuto start to loosen up beside him, his hips swaying almost reluctantly. Taiga bumps his shoulder against his. “Not so bad, right?”</p><p>Hokuto flashes him a rueful little smile. “I suppose not.”</p><p>They dance through the first few songs, Taiga joyfully flailing and Hokuto doing this sort of sinuous full-body undulation that he’s trying very hard not to find distracting. By the time the band slows it down for a ballad, they’re both breathing hard, skin gleaming with a light sheen of sweat.</p><p>Taiga peers at Hokuto as the yearning notes of a ballad fill the arena. His eyes are closed, long lashes fluttering against his cheeks, lost in the music.</p><p>His heart stutters. <em>God, he’s beautiful</em>.</p><p>As if feeling his gaze, Hokuto blinks and meets his eyes. For a long, suspended moment, they just stare at each other as the crooning vocals wash over them. The rest of the crowd seems to fade away until it’s just them, swaying together in the twilight.</p><p>Taiga licks his suddenly dry lips. Hokuto’s eyes flicker down to follow the motion.</p><p>Ever so slowly, Taiga reaches out to curl his fingers around Hokuto’s. He startles but doesn’t pull away, eyes flying back up to his.</p><p>Taiga tugs gently until Hokuto steps closer, until he can feel Hokuto’s heat all along his front. His free hand comes up to rest tentatively on Taiga’s shoulder. Taiga slide his other arm around Hokuto’s waist.</p><p>And then they’re dancing, turning in a slow circle right there in front of their seats, entwined in an intimate little bubble as the music plays on.</p><p>“This okay?” Taiga murmurs, not wanting to break the spell.</p><p>Hokuto nods, swaying closer until their foreheads touch. “Yeah. It’s … nice.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes drift shut as he breathes Hokuto in, relishing the warm weight of him against him. He wants to stay lost in this perfect moment forever.</p><p>But all too soon, the final notes of the song are fading out, and the spell is broken. They step apart, flushed and uncertain.</p><p>“Um. Thanks for the dance,” Hokuto says, ducking his head shyly.</p><p>“Anytime,” Taiga replies, meaning it.</p><p>He’s still holding Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>They settle back into their seats for the rest of the show, but it’s like a livewire hums between them now. They keep stealing little glances at each other, fingers brushing as they clap and cheer. Each casual touch sends sparks skittering across Taiga’s skin.</p><p>By the time the band launches into their encore, Taiga’s so keyed up that he’s practically vibrating out of his seat. He needs to touch Hokuto again like he needs air.</p><p>As the final song ends in a crescendo of joyful noise, Taiga turns to Hokuto with his heart in his throat. But before he can figure out what to say, Hokuto’s pulling him into a fierce hug, arms wrapping tight around Taiga’s shoulders.</p><p>Taiga buries his face in the crook of Hokuto’s neck and just breathes, overcome. They cling to each other there amongst the cheering crowd, lost in their own little world, reluctant to let go.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hokuto whispers against his ear, barely audible over the noise. “For tonight. For everything.”</p><p>“I’m really glad you were here,” Taiga whispers back. “Even if it wasn’t exactly under the best circumstances.”</p><p>Hokuto huffs a quiet laugh and squeezes Taiga tighter for a second before pulling back enough to look him in the eye. “Would it be totally crazy if I said I’m really glad my asshole ex dumped me right before this concert?”</p><p>Taiga grins at him, elated. “Definitely crazy. But I’m really glad too.”</p><p>They stay wrapped up together as the house lights come up and the crowd starts to disperse. Reality is already creeping in around the edges, but Taiga’s in no hurry to let this magical little bubble burst.</p><p>Not when Hokuto is looking at him like that, eyes sparkling, cheeks pink.</p><p>“So,” Taiga says, trying to sound braver than he feels. “Can I give you my number? Maybe we could grab coffee sometime? Or dinner?”</p><p>Hokuto’s smile is blinding, unleashing an entire kaleidoscope of butterflies in Taiga’s stomach. “I’d like that. A lot.”</p><p>Numbers are exchanged, another lingering hug, and then they’re swept apart by the departing throng. Taiga watches him until he disappears from view, already counting the minutes until he can see Hokuto again.</p><p>What a night. What a start to something new, something exhilarating and full of promise</p><p>Taiga has a feeling he’s going to owe the band a debt of gratitude for this one.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, he owes Hokuto’s douchebag ex one too.</p>
