<br/>
</p><p>Summer is its very own filter. Everyone just looked extra glowing with sunblock as their signature fragrance. Or maybe, it wasn’t summer, everyone was just happier than Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>“Are those tears?” Shintaro teased, flashing his white teeth; a perfect contrast to his tanned skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off,” Taiga sneered and when Shintaro turned his back on him, he finally let out a sigh. His claps faltered, but the cheering grew louder as the bride and the groom kissed in the middle of the dance floor. The woman in the pink satin wedding gown was just radiating with happiness. </p><p> </p><p>And she was Taiga’s first love. </p><p> </p><p>But no one really believed him. No one took him seriously when he said that he was in love with their Year 10 English teacher. She was also his main driver for joining their school’s theater group, even though he couldn’t do anything but be a tree, and he even dragged Shintaro to become a lighting staff.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed once more, the cheers hushed, and the music became sweet and mellow. The newlyweds started slow dancing, and the humid afternoon was not enough to deter them while they hugged closely, murmured sweet nothings, and just basked in love. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga tried to smile, genuinely this time, and thought how first love is called “first love”, because it was never meant to be his last. It would just be the beginning. And he guessed, this wouldn’t be his first heartbreak too. </p><p> </p><p>“This beef just melts in my mouth,” said Shintaro as they resumed eating. </p><p> </p><p>“Everything just melts in your mouth,” said Taiga, eating a spoonful of his mashed, while Shintaro seemed to be swallowing everything without chewing.  </p><p> </p><p>“When are you going back to Uni? Fams will be going on a cruise to Auckland up until Australia Day. Want to tag along?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga is brimming with jealousy. Last summer, Shintaro and his family went hiking in Patagonia, while he spent his summer break helping out with his family’s sushi restaurant at Sydney Fish Market. </p><p> </p><p>“I wish. I have to help out at the restaurant. It’s extremely busy during summer.” </p><p> </p><p>“What for? You won’t be inheriting it.” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga chuckled. “You know my dad. Anyway, how’s uni?” He asked instead to change the topic. Shintaro and he are both incoming college 2nd years. Shintaro stayed in Sydney to study Communication Arts, while he went all the way to Victoria where, to his father’s dismay, he decided to take a PreMed course. Who says all Asian parents want their kids to be doctors, engineers, or lawyers? Definitely not his dad.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m still a virgin.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga almost choked on his steak. “That’s not really what I want to know.” </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro looked so pleased to have shocked him as he continued to eat, his mouth almost full that it was a miracle he could still speak coherently. “Uni is more lax than I expected. Well, it’s not like my lectures are that hard compared to yours. How about you?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shrugged his shoulders. “Hmmm, not that lax, but I don’t feel like it has gotten busy. After all, I still have the time to go back here for summer when I could have just stayed there and studied.” </p><p> </p><p>A glint sparked at the corner of Shintaro’s eyes as he whispered urgently, “Becca, I mean, the now Mrs. McInerny is coming here.” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s heart started drumming. The alluring smell of fresh daisies and vanilla wafted to their table as his fellow theater group paused in gorging their meal to greet their former club adviser. </p><p> </p><p>“Taiga, are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>He almost yelped when Shintaro elbowed him. “You’re just too breathtaking,” he said, utterly mesmerized before he could stop himself. Becca’s face radiated tranquility, and Taiga thought that drew him in. Becca provided reprieve during the chaotic years of preparing for Uni.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean…” he smiled and owned up to his feelings, “Well, I really mean that. Congratulations, Becca!” </p><p> </p><p>Becca smiled widely. “Thank you. You’ll always be one of my most diligent students that I’m proud of.” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained smiling. That was all he was, just one of her countless students. She resumed greeting those in the next table, while he could only look wistfully. Becca is like his summer, it has the power to make him suffer, and toast his tofu skin, but he still likes it anyway. But just like every other season, it has to end and pave the way for fall.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>Hokuto could get really unlucky after a bit of luck. It was lucky he was able to get that free mX newspaper. Then, he quickly found a vacant seat during a busy Friday night, but what came after was just a string of bad luck. He scanned the free tabloid to distract himself that the carriage was boiling, the woman beside him was overloading his nostrils with her perfume, and the guy across from him looked stoned and must have winked flirtatiously at him several times. He picked up mX to entertain himself during another dreary commute but was clowning himself. </p><p> </p><p>The commuters thinned out after Chatswood, his eyes on alert for a vacant seat while he fanned the paper on his face and debated if transferring seats would lead to another bad luck. But when the bloke beside the stoned guy started trimming his nails, that was the last straw. Hokuto stood up and walked to the nearest vacant reversible seat, the lady's perfume still clung to his shirt, so he fanned harder, hoping it would dispel the smell. </p><p> </p><p>The train slowed and stopped at Killara. Hokuto watched the door as a few passengers entered, and the smell on his shirt was briefly forgotten as a guy in a white tuxedo entered. Hokuto increased his fanning. The guy must be a masochist for wearing a tuxedo in the middle of summer. </p><p> </p><p><em> Mr.Tuxedo </em> chose to stand by the door despite the vacant seats, he loosened his bowtie as though he had a personal grudge against it, he checked his phone as though it also offended him, and when he was done checking, he let out a long sigh and Hokuto could feel the heaviness emanating from it.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could only sympathize. He didn’t know what Mr. Tuxedo was going through, but he could relate to his mood. After all, Hokuto just learned that he needed to go back to being a freshie because none of his subjects from Billy Blue College of Design would be credited as he changed majors. His parents would surely throttle his neck. They were already against him choosing a design course, and now that he decided to switch, his ass would surely be whipped.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed and watched Mr. Tuxedo finger-combed his hair and glancing at him with his big eyes. Hokuto didn’t want to be rude, but it was hard to avert his gaze. “Androgynous” must have been invented for Mr. Tuxedo, his face was a cross between handsome and pretty, but he also gave off a spiky air that suggested he was hard to approach.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Tuxedo didn't seem to care about Hokuto’s staring as he shifted his gaze back to the summer’s late sunsets. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed once more and focused his eyes on the weird fabric used for public transport. However, there must be an invisible string between them, because Hokuto stole another glance, and this time, he quickly turned away. He unfolded the tabloid and riffled the pages. The print just floated around as his mind returned to seeing a tear fall from Mr. Tuxedo. The guy must be really struggling with something more than heat exhaustion. He let out a deep breath as the train decreased speed, he looked up surreptitiously to see Mr. Tuxedo alighting at Wahroonga. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto jolted and cursed. Another bad luck. He couldn't recall if the train skipped his stop, or he just missed it altogether.</p><p> </p><p>He made it to the platform before the door closed. The newspaper was still in his hand as he glanced over to the retreating white tuxedo. </p><p> </p>

</p><p>“I was listening to Double Z on my way here, and he said that if you’re spending V-day alone, you might as well consider joining <em> Flame Island </em> ,” Taiga narrated as soon as Shintaro opened his door to greet him. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not alone today, you’re with us,” Shintaro said tearfully, pulling him for a hug and adding, “You’re the best bruv”  when his wife and his 2-year-old baby came into view.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga forgot all about being single on Valentine's Day and shoved Shintaro away to carry the cutest human being he had the opportunity to call his goddaughter.</p><p> </p><p>“How is my little munchkin cutie potato,” he said, burying his nose on her chest that smelled of fragrant milk. As though she understood him, she squealed with delight and pinched his cheeks, Taiga could feel her baby nails digging into his pores. </p><p> </p><p>“Stop that Kekiokolanee, your godfather and I need to do lots of cleaning.” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes and looked at Kiera, Shintaro’s wife. “You really should have not let him name her.” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s nice. It’s unique,” Shintaro argued. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it’s nice and unique, but wait until she starts school.” He returned Kekiokolanee to her mother as he and Shintaro headed to the garage to start their business for the day. The Morimoto family would be moving to Canberra as Shintaro got a job at a Japanese embassy. </p><p> </p><p>“I just returned here a couple of years ago and now you guys are leaving,” he said sadly, scanning the mess in the garage. It looked like Shintaro and Kiera emptied all their drawers and cupboards and chucked everything in the garage. </p><p> </p><p>“The money is too good to pass up. Plus, they agreed on how I want my vacay to be used. By the way, don’t be shy, I know that a huge chunk of our stuff would be thrown away outside, and fingers-crossed, the dumpster divers had it clean by the morning. So, if you want anything - <em> anything </em> - just say so and take it.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga grinned and eyed the Honda motorbike. “That one will help us in deliveries. You also have an electric scooter, right?” </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro actually looked relieved. “Take it and thanks heaps.” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga grinned again. He felt a bit shy about taking stuff from his best friend, but he made a mental note that he should at least buy Kekiokolanee her first car. </p><p> </p><p>“Are most of these yours?” Taiga spotted a tray of old Nokias, Blackberrys, and Gameboys, and he couldn’t believe they had that much. Taiga thought he hadn’t used more than 10 phones since he started having phones. There were also four metal shelves by the wall, two of which were chock-a-block with worn-out office storage boxes. </p><p> </p><p>“I say, 50/50? Kiera’s quite a hoarder, too,” said Shintaro while he started shuffling albums of CDs and DVDs, “But those boxes are her’s, she studied law until she got burnt and gave up on it.” </p><p> </p><p>“Really? Didn’t know that.” Taiga knew Shintaro met Kiera when he worked as PR for a large law firm. </p><p> </p><p>“All of those are up for grabs - I think. Do you want them?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga frowned. “Why would I need them? Let me still check if some personal documents got misplaced.” He opened one box and scanned binders over binders. All of which were full of legal jargon that his simple mind found too hard to comprehend.</p><p> </p><p>“Have some chips and soda,” said Kiera as she entered the garage.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm, thanks, but we just started,” said Taiga, he didn’t want to sound ungrateful.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m famished,” Shintaro said and grabbed a handful. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga simply shook his head and opened a clear book. “Oooh, what are these clippings…<em>Here’s Looking at You</em>?” </p><p> </p><p>Kiera giggled and blushed while Shintaro scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Remember those love notes on mX?” asked Kiera.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded. He is familiar with the column where readers would send love notes to anyone who had caught their interest during their daily commute. Taiga’s mom would always bring home a copy and he would read it with passing fancy. <span>Secretly, he hoped that someone would drop him a note.</span></p><p> </p><p>“That was how she met her boyfriend - <em> ex-boyfriend </em>,” muttered Shintaro, looking so unimpressed. “For real, people who send those messages are the same breed you meet on dating apps nowadays. They’re either losers, weird, have criminal histories, sex offenders, and psychopaths. There are no in-between.”</p><p> </p><p>Kiera slapped Shintaro’s shoulder and Taiga shared her disgust. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s very judgy,” said Taiga. He felt offended on behalf of those who mean well. “I think most of them sounded normal and…cute.”</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro wasn't easily persuaded. “If they are normal and cute, they won’t have problems asking someone out face-to-face.”</p><p> </p><p>Kiera raised an eyebrow. “Tell me, did you leave a note and never got a reply?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga chuckled and teased his best mate. “I can see him doing something like that.” </p><p> </p><p>“Duh. Me? People lined up to ask me out,” Shintaro countered, “I won’t even be surprised if someone left a note for me during those years when I still didn’t have a car. I'm sure the train commuters got sad when I stopped riding it,” he added with confidence despite the reddening of his face. He pointed to the clear book on Taiga’s lap and said, “That belongs to the bin,” he finished.</p><p> </p><p>“These are a lot,” said Taiga, still smiling as he flipped the covers.</p><p> </p><p>“Not really,  those were just a year’s worth before the paper ended. Was it 2015 when they shut down?” </p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded and started reading some of the ads, which according to Shintaro, were placed by losers and weirdos.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<em> “To the goth girl with nose piercing and got off at Flemington last Sunday morning. Nice tatts, want me to do you another? — Goth boy </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “To the cute little blonde having an opal trouble at Townhall station at 8am Tuesday, want to get on and get off sometime?” — Geoff </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “To the stunning chick with purple leggings who got in at 8.14 Bondi Junction and off at Martin Place last Friday, I’m the guy across from you with purple tie, want to catch up?” — Purple but not Barney </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “To the gorgeous tradie at 4.01 from Parramatta to Blacktown, want to trade numbers?” — Jessica </em>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>“Kyomo, did you come here to read that?” asked Shintaro, looking a bit miffed.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” said Taiga, only noticing that Kiera had gone back inside and as he rose from the floor, another note caught his eye. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<em> “To the guy wearing a white tux that got on at Killara to Wahroonga. We briefly met each other's eyes. Do you need someone to talk to? I’m all ears. — CFM6 </em>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Taiga’s heart raced while he read the note again. The clip is dateless but there was only one incident where he wore a white tux, and he got on at Killara to home –  his teacher’s wedding. </p><p> </p><p>His heart continued to drum, and after making sure Shintaro wasn’t looking, he took a snap of the clip. </p><p> </p><p><em> CFM </em>. Every boy who went to an all-boys school at North Shore knows that abbreviation, CFM stands for “Chives, Figs, and Mortar”, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant at Hornsby, which he could only hope is still open. </p><p><br/>

</p><p>“Six years single…does that make me weird?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not,” replied Hokuto, interlacing his fingers while finding himself distracted by Allison’s heavy-set of eyelashes. “You were in a long-term relationship that ended badly, and giving your heart a break is a logical choice.”</p><p> </p><p>“But I think the dating scene has changed a lot.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that why you joined <em> Flame Island </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded glumly, anxiety flashing on her almost orange face from frequent suntan. “Is true love even possible here? Or do I have to settle for money at the end?” </p><p> </p><p>“Cut!” </p><p> </p><p>Allison, the <em> Islander </em>, was immediately attended by the make-up artist while their program director, Howard, praised her for her last line. </p><p> </p><p>“I love that question you threw in, it gives you an ‘I’m a hopeless-romantic but also a gold-digger’ vibe.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Ta! </em>I thought of that line!”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto ignored their exchange of empty flattery and snatched the beach towel behind his seat to cover his bare torso. </p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto!” Howard turned to him, his hands moving as fast as his lips. “Gorgeous as always. The stoic look fits you perfectly, but can we try to look a bit - just a bit - less annoyed?”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto uncrossed his arms, revealing his naked torso. “I don’t know, maybe I’ll look more thrilled if I’m allowed to wear a bloody shirt or even a fucking tank top.”</p><p> </p><p>Howard had the audacity to appear surprised at his demand. “But we’re supposed to give the viewers an island vibe.” He gestured to Allison, who was just in her string bikinis, while they chatted by the pool. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re not on Sentinel Island. We even have a pool and a mansion, why can’t I have clothes?”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me talk to the wardrobe department, maybe they can give you something like a net shirt or perhaps, a <em> lei </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“A lei?!” He repeated, flabbergasted. “What’s next? A hula dance?” </p><p> </p><p>Howard gave him a dismissive wave and moved on before Hokuto could protest further. And after his quick talk with Allison, he returned to his assigned dressing room. Calling it a “dressing room” is being generous since his wardrobe only consisted of extremely short boardies that could pass off as boxers but waterproof. </p><p> </p><p>“After this season, I’m so done,” he muttered to his agent, who was grinning and absorbed in his phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Even if they hike up your salary?” He asked, not looking-up. </p><p> </p><p>“I will still leave,” he said with finality, while he put on real clothes. </p><p> </p><p>“This show is the reason why your appointment calendar is fully-booked until winter.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto scoffed. “Fully-booked of women who are trying to sleep with me.” </p><p> </p><p>“No men?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not interested in them either. Let’s go,” he said, put on his sunnies, and left the bayside mansion.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was lucky to get a job right after registering as a psychologist. A senior from Uni recommended him to be a guest counselor for the reality show, <em> Flame Island </em>. The said show is Big Brother, Survivor, Bachelorette, Bachelor, and Playboy Mansion rolled into one. The contestants, more famously called “Islanders”, would try to find their match and at the end of the season, they have a choice to remain a couple or split-up and take 50,000 dollars. When Hokuto heard about the show, he deemed it trash TV for him to even spend minutes on it, but he couldn’t say no to a senior. </p><p> </p><p>He was supposed to be a guest for only one episode since the show’s resident psychologist got COVID, and unfortunately, the said psychologist never recovered and Hokuto was asked to return for the rest of the first season. At first, he did enjoy assessing and helping a bunch of B and C-list celebrities and influencers, but he later learned that he was too naive. None of the “islanders” gave a fork about love. They were too narcissistic for love, and most were just in for sex, money, and their 5-minutes of fame. It was rightly called “Flame Island, because once the flame goes out, so do their feelings. </p><p> </p><p>However, if there was one thing - and one thing only - he was thankful for the show was that he was able to open his practice. But the main consequence of being recognized from the show was that a chunk of his clients wanted his help in fulfilling their sexual fantasies with him. And as a professional, trifling with his clients is something he would never do. </p><p> </p><p>He reached a popular place in his teens and grinned seeing how it went from a hole in the wall to a sprawling estate that even has a ranch and golf course. He parked his car next to the new CFM building and instantly spotted his two best mates as he came in.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Jess, Juri!” </p><p> </p><p>“Is that our sexiest psychologist alive?” Juri teased. </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up!” He said with gritted teeth as he lowered himself on the seat. “I haven’t been here for ages!” He feasted his eyes around the Viking-inspired interior with wooden beams, hanging candle lanterns, chevron-printed walls, and long wooden dining tables. </p><p> </p><p>“They really ramped up this place!” He added, impressed. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s posh now and anyone under 18 should come with an adult,” said Jesse, leaning closer as though he was telling a secret.</p><p> </p><p>“Blimey. All the boys' schools nearby have to find a different hangout then.”</p><p> </p><p>Juri looked disgusted. “Lucky for us, because I don’t know about you guys, kids today are an absolute nightmare.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure your mama said the same thing about you,” said Jesse, chuckling.</p><p> </p><p>“By the way, have you ordered?” asked Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>“We did,” said Juri, “I ordered your fave.”</p><p> </p><p>“Double siders with chips on the side, no cheese, drizzled with dragon’s blood instead of tomato sauce,” he and Juri said together. </p><p> </p><p>“Nice of you to remember.” They fist bump and Juri added, “That’s 16.99.”</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh? That used to be 4.99! When did it get so exy? Kids wouldn’t be able to afford this,” he complained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Granny,” said Jesse, chuckling, “Kids today get a tenner for allowance.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Per week?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jesse cackled louder. “Per day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto gasped. “Either their parents are rich or mine are cheapskates. I had to beg to increase mine to a fiver when I was in Year 10!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri shook his head. “Everything is more expensive nowadays.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto agreed. “If I’m paying 16.99 for burgers, I should have had oysters instead.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who goes to CFM for oysters?” asked Jesse, looking repulsed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They don’t have it here? I’ve been craving oysters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would you need an aphrodisiac?” asked Juri, his smile full of malice, “Are you hooking-up with any of the Islanders?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto ignored Juri’s teasing. “Thank you for reminding me I’m solo, but you two are not, so why are we meeting for Valentine's?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Love is for everyone, mate….” said Juri but the next part of his reply became white noise as something caught Hokuto’s eye. Or rather, someone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Taiga.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto felt like he was watching the first episode of Flame Island where islanders entered the mansion in slow-motion; their hair perfectly blown by the wind, their sun-kissed skin glowed under the harsh lights, and their body proportions highlighted. That was how Hokuto saw Taiga as he entered CFM, but except for Taiga’s striking looks, there was nothing else remarkable. Taiga was dressed almost the same as how he saw him again; an all-black ensemble that was loose fitting to his slender frame. </p><p> </p><p>He sat at the bar area near the entrance and whispered something to the bartender who gave him a menu. Hokuto sighed. It was hard to define his relationship with Taiga. They knew each other by name. They’ve chatted more than once. They’ve found themselves in odd or awkward situations. They’ve seen each other at their best and their worst. And they’ve done stuff Hokuto never imagined doing with Jesse and Juri. Despite all that, he couldn’t put a label on their relationship. </p><p> </p><p>The doors opened again, and a woman pushed a pram toward Taiga, before she went out in haste. Taiga broke into a smile and the room seemingly brightened. He lifted a baby from the pram and showered the baby with kisses, whose giggles reached even Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Something trembled within Hokuto that made him hold his chest. A deep sorrowful feeling takes over. The man he once waited for 9 years ago is now a father and a husband. And just like the first time he ever saw Taiga, he could do nothing but look.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<span>Never in Taiga’s life did he think there would come a day when he had to debate whether to steal something or not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Technically, he won’t be stealing the book. He would be just a few tables away and use it while in the library. But if someone else is using it, would that count as stealing? He looked around the busy Hargrave-Andrew Library; it was an impressive sight that the semester had just started but students were already cracking it. More seats were added to accommodate extra students since two other libraries were being renovated, and although the library looked packed, it was unbelievably hushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sighing, he checked his watch. He'd been standing at the same spot with the book he wanted and whoever had been reading it had taken a long time to return. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>They like colors, too</span>
</em>
<span>,” He observed, seeing 15 pieces of midliners of varying shades. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Scuse.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga stepped back as he came face-to-face with a guy with the straightest nose he had seen on an Asian guy. Taiga thought the guy looked familiar, but he couldn’t place where he had seen him. And he couldn’t be racist with his kind by saying all Asians look alike. Or maybe, the guy looked familiar because he was what every Asian parent would be proud of - tall, good-looking, he looked obedient, probably played the piano or the violin, he’s probably good in Math, too, and since he was reading Anatomy and Physiology, he would definitely be a doctor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One odd thing though, the guy looked astonished upon seeing him. He even took off his glasses to scratch his eyes. And now, he just looked at him with wide-eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhm, sorry for standing here,” said Taiga, he was starting to grow so uncomfortable that he started doubting his sanity. The guy didn’t answer back and just stared at him in bewilderment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhm, are you done with this book?” he asked, pointing at Elaine Marieb’s Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology, “I really need it and all the copies have been taken. I mean, there are other AnaPhysio books but this is what I preferred.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The guy didn’t budge. Not even a blink. Taiga wondered if the guy was an international student and his accent was too thick to comprehend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He cleared his throat and asked slowly, “Are…you…done…with…this…book?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Amusement flashed the guy’s face, or it might be just Taiga’s imagination as the guy resumed to his perplexed self.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He sighed and gave up. “I guess you’re not done with it. Apologies -”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can have it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pardon?” Taiga thought he heard a voice, but he might be mistaken because it was really small. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The guy cleared his throat. “You can have it. I’m done with it, but had to take it back for a bit so I can copy something, and I just haven’t gotten back to returning it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, right.” </span>
<em>
<span>Some people have it all, </span>
</em>
<span>Taiga thought, the guy has a nice voice too. The type one could listen to forever even though the topic is boring. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhm, I’ll be taking it then, cheers!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He quickly went back to his seat. Feeling unnecessarily elated and as soon as he sat, he checked the back and saw nothing but a barcode. He bit his lip at this foolishness. He was too dumb to think that his Uni library would be like his Year 6 school library where he would deem it as fate if he saw his crush’s name as the previous borrower of the book. Not that he has a crush on the guy, he was just curious. He should have at least introduced himself before he took the book.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He glanced back and saw the guy’s seat now vacant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There would be another time, he guessed. </span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
<span>It was raining cats and dogs when Hokuto reached his flat, but he was on fire. His face was hot, and his heart thudded against his ribs, while he continued to rub his sweaty palms on his jeans. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He locked the door of his room and sank to the floor. His string of good luck today seemed to have exceeded the bad. First, he was able to borrow the book that had always been unavailable. He found a vacant seat at such a busy library. He reached his flat before the rain fell. But the highlight of everything that Lady Luck had been blessing him with was meeting him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>HIM. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Mr. Tuxedo</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The guy he foolishly left a note for at “Here’s Looking at You.” The same guy who, if he had seen his note, had stood him up and probably thought he was crazy. Well, he admits that he’s a tad unhinged for doing what he did. He even thought he was being smart by putting on CFM as a clue, because if the guy lived in Wahroonga, he might have gone to a nearby all-boys school and knew the place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But the past meant nothing now. Sure, it would go down as one of his most embarrassing moments that he waited for 5 straight days at CFM at 6 pm since his note was published, but no one else knew that but him. So what were the chances he would see Mr. Tuxedo again after more than a year? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is this fate?” He murmured. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not fate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He almost yelped when Kochi sat up from his bed. His clothes were all wrinkled as he stretched his arms over his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What time is it? It was so cloudy earlier, I fell asleep,” he asked, half-speaking and half-yawning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto immediately checked his watch. “It’s 5.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! I just missed my 3 pm class then,” he said casually and checked his phone, “the fuck this phone didn’t alarm. Oh - I set it for tomorrow at 3 pm. By the way, what about this fate you were talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fate…Fate/Stay Night…the anime?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, I think I’ve heard about it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto smiled. “It’s nice,” he lied. He never saw it either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kochi made a noncommittal nod before going to the loo, and Hokuto sighed in relief. No matter how friendly Kochi was, he was still walking on eggshells around him. Maybe because Kochi wasn’t only older, he was also his Uni senior. Both of them are in the field of Psychology, the only difference is Kochi gearing up to become a psychiatrist, while Hokuto would stop at being a psychologist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I should have at least asked for his name,” he murmured, removing his jumper, when Kochi opened the door to the toilet, and a swishing sound spiraled down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there a way to know who borrowed the book before or after you at the library?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Barcode. Just scan it,” replied Kochi as he turned on his lamp by his study table. His notes and books were all neatly lined-up, but Kochi started reading a crime novel instead. Hokuto wished he would be as chill as Kochi once he reached the fourth year of his Bachelor's. He was already struggling as a 2nd-year student, but Kochi still acted as though everything was just a walk in the park.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? That easy?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But, of course, you should be working at the library to gain that access. Why?” asked Kochi, tilting his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhm, j-just curious.” He resumed stripping before heading to the showers. Now that he knew that Mr. Tuxedo went to the same Uni as him, there could be another chance their paths would cross. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He could only hope. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
