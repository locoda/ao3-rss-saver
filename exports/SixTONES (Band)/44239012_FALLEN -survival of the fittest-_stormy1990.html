      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In the year (無戦) Musen 28 of the worldwide so called eternal war, one year after Taiga had arrived at the West Center as a Chaser, their civil war against the Fallen was about to change drastically.<br/>For years the West Center had thought their biggest enemy were Myuto and the Fallen following him. After they had succeeded in getting Aran on their side and make a Reverse serum to turn the Fallen DNA into a new mutation, which allowed them to keep their Fallen abilities and strength, but freed them from the emotionless mind set of the survival of the fittest, the West Center had falsely though that they could move on into a new era without Vestige and Fallen trying to kill each other while the ultimate mistake lay at the Government not taking responsibility for their own impropriate illegal DNA mutation research.<br/>For Taiga and Hokuto a new fight had started with the destruction of the East Center and while they now needed to try to protect their own Center they would eventually have to sacrifice more than they were willing to!</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Welcome back to the sequel of CHASER, I hope you will enjoy this part as well!<br/>Don't be too taken aback by the Cover as KyomoHoku will still be the Main pairing of this fic until the very end, but without trouble the story wouldn't be interesting, right?</p><p>As always be prepared for spelling/grammar mistakes and plot holes<br/>I hope you enjoy reading\^^/</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>Just remembering Taisuke's dangerous glare, his unbeatable copy ability, a speed and strength not even Myuto could stand up against, was too much for Taiga to even be able to think about any plan how they could ever be able to face Taisuke together with the other Fallen he had gathered.</p><p>"Didn't you say your healing ability would make them recover faster?"</p><p>Hokuto's voice. So at least he was safe and they were most likely back at their Center, because the next voice he heard was from Shime.</p><p>"Physically I can heal them faster than our abilities can, but I can't repair mental damage, so after such a fight I guess they all need some more time to get up."</p><p>Which meant as much as Kentaro and Myuto were most likely also still unconscious.</p><p>Feeling the pressure of Hokuto's hand closing around his, Taiga finally fought himself out of all the dark thoughts and he squeezed the other one's hand back.</p><p>"Are you awake?"</p><p>The worried tone made Taiga smile faintly at him when he opened his eyes before he nodded. "Are we at the West Center?"</p><p>"Yes, we got some unexpected help in the end."</p><p>Hokuto explained while Taiga scanned the room. It was their medical station and he could spot Myuto and Kentaro on other beds, with Reo sitting next to Kentaro with a dark expression.</p><p>"You should be okay to get up and walk around," Shime said.  "I have a healing ability so your physical wounds are all good."</p><p>"How about Myuto?"</p><p>"He'll be fine, but just a bit later and maybe even I wouldn't have been able to rescue him," Shime explained with a gloomy expression. "I'm sorry that you had to face Taisuke like this without any warning."</p><p>"It's not like that is your fault," Taiga let out, but then he saw the way Hokuto's expression changed.</p><p>"Is there something I don't know?"</p><p>Shime shifted a bit uncomfortable next to the bed before he bowed apologizing towards Taiga who didn't even know what was going on.</p><p>"I should have said something earlier, but with Myuto and the others around and the focus on the Reverse serum I wanted to wait until I've seen the results."</p><p>"Wait with what?" Taiga asked curiously yet a bit terrified by the way the boy looked so scared.</p><p>"Taisuke is my older brother."</p><p>The missing reaction from Hokuto and also from Reo meant that they had already been told, but Taiga didn't even know what to do with that information.</p><p>"Okay... Thanks for telling us, I guess?" Taiga said a bit lost.</p><p>"You're not angry?"</p><p>"Were they angry?" Taiga asked and pointed at the others, but as expected Shime shook his head.</p><p>"You are not at fault for what your brother does as a Fallen. Not even your brother himself is at fault for that, because he is after all a Fallen and not in control of his emotions."</p><p>The explanation made sense, yet Shime didn't seem to feel better.</p><p>"Where are the others?" Taiga asked instead and Hokuto got up.</p><p>"Let's go meet them. As Shime said you should be fine getting up and Reo promised to have a look at Kentaro and Myuto until they wake up."</p><p>Taiga nodded and got up, relieved to not feel tired or unstable on his feet.</p><p>Shime left together with them, but instead of the lab, they left for the training room.</p><p>"Moro, Hagi and Yuma are in the special Fallen room, waiting for Myuto to wake up. Just then they will agree to get the serum."</p><p>It sounded fair and while Taiga wanted them to feel safe while doing the transition he felt a sudden urge to rush them, because they couldn't stand a chance against Taisuke. But would numbers even matter?</p><p>Sudden loud noises from the training room made Taiga look up at the glass and he found a handful of unknown faces together with Juri, Shintaro and Jesse.</p><p>"Aran and Kochi are in the lab at the moment. They try to improve the serum, so we can go later and talk to them," Hokuto added before he entered the training room.</p><p>“I guess Aran is trying to distract himself instead of sitting next to Myuto and worry,” Taiga realized, but he couldn’t blame him.</p><p>"Taiga, you're awake! How are you feeling?" Jesse asked and hugged him before even waiting for a reply if he was still hurt.</p><p>"All good, no need to worry."</p><p>"This is definitely the most messed up situation we've been in so far," Shintaro added.</p><p>"Are they…?"</p><p>"The ones who helped you yes," Juri explained while Taiga hurried to walk up to the six boys in front of him and bowed.</p><p>"Thank you for your help. I fear without you none of us would have survived."</p><p>One of them laughed and shook his head, but he didn't get up from the ground where he was sitting, leaning to the back instead. "Trust me if Taisuke wanted to kill you then you'd be dead, us most likely as well."</p><p>Unfortunately Taiga had guessed that already, but he didn't want to say it out loud.</p><p>"So you are the Fallen in control of his senses we heard about?" Another one of them asked, scanning Taiga from head to toe with an intense stare.</p><p>Taiga looked a bit worried towards Hokuto, but he also didn't know how they had gotten that information.</p><p>"Let me explain a bit before this gets too complicated," Shime offered and walked up to the other boys. He stopped next to the boy sitting on the ground and who had spoken up first. He had curly black hair, which was already so long that it was hard to see his eyes when he was sitting. “This is Nakamura Kaito. He is a Chaser from the South Center.” The boy just lifted his hand, not bothering with getting up and introducing himself. Not to forget that details had to wait for later. They had a dangerous enemy right in front of their doors and who knew if Taisuke wasn’t planning another attack already.</p><p>Shime stopped next to the boy who had spoken next and put his hand on his shoulder. The boy was the tallest of them all and he had a little bit longer straight black hair. “This is Kawashima Noel. He is the ace of the Chasers in the Main Center.”</p><p>“Now I would have loved to see him compete against Taiga when he was still a Chaser,” Shintaro whispered, but Noel just cracked a smile.</p><p>Shime kept going and pointed at a boy at his left who had red curly hair and a sheepish smile on his lips. “Matsukura Kaito, a Vestige from the Main Center.”</p><p>“Do you have any special abilities?” Juri asked, but the boy shook his head.</p><p>“Wait two of you are called Kaito? This is going to be confusing,” Jesse interfered.</p><p>“Then what would you do if I told you my name was also Kaito?” One of the other boys with slightly wavy black hair said with a teasing smile as he got up and bowed slightly to the others. “My name is Miyachika Kaito. I am a Chaser from the East Center.” </p><p>Shime walked up to him and patted his shoulder. “You can call him Chaka and the other two Matsuku and Umi.”</p><p>“I already have a headache,” Shintaro let out, but with so many new people it was normal that they needed some time to remember everyone in the first place.</p><p>“Our youngest member is Yoshizawa Shizuya, a Chaser from the North Center,” Shime added and pointed at the boy with short black hair and slightly chubby cheeks.</p><p>“And definitely the worst Chaser you have ever seen,” the last boy spoke making Shizu seem slightly embarrassed. “But he puts a lot of passion into his job.”</p><p>Now Shizu seemed even more embarrassed, but Shime pulled everyone’s attention back to the remaining boy. “This is Matsuda Genta from the North Center and he is a Vestige. He is the strongest Vestige in our team.”</p><p>“Is he stronger than Myuto?” Taiga asked and the boy with the dark gray hair nodded.</p><p>“My special ability is to be able to attack with ten times my strength, but of course I need a long recharge time and it only works for a few seconds. I can hold someone down or put enough strength into my grip to even crush bones, but of course Taisuke stays unaffected even by that ability.”</p><p> “Wait, you are all from different Centers, some of you Vestige, others Chasers. What is your connection?” Shintaro asked and then pointed at Chaka. “And why weren’t you at the East Center attack right from the start?”</p><p>The boys all exchanged a troubled expression for a moment before it was Taiga who caught up to the situation first. “You are all connected to Taisuke.”</p><p>“More or less, yes,” Shime explained. “The same as Myuto, Taisuke gathered other Fallen around him, but he didn’t do so to rescue them from the Government. All he wanted was to gather the most skilled Fallen to be able to eventually strike back at the Capitol.”</p><p>“So the Fallen he gathered are connected to the other boys,” Juri said. “Well those details can wait for later I think. For now we need as much information about Taisuke and the other Fallen as we can get.”</p><p>“All of us stood in contact all this time,” Shime started. “We only clashed once with Taisuke and the others, since then they had retreated so far away from the city that we couldn’t find them anymore. When the attack at the East Center happened, Chaka was out with a few Chasers and two Vestige. So luckily he was able to contact us.”</p><p>“That’s why you all came as backup,” Hokuto concluded.</p><p>“You guys gave Taisuke a tough challenge. But you have to think again if you really want to join us against them,” Genta said. “Taisuke likes playing around, but we all had trouble with just him, now imagine him coming with the others.”</p><p>“By then we will luckily have three more Fallen on our side,” Juri said, but he still seemed skeptical as well after all even Myuto and Kentaro hadn’t stood a chance.</p><p>“Taisuke will be a threat to all Centers from now on, so there is no way we will stay back,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“I am really glad to hear that,” Shime said and walked up to Taiga and Hokuto. “I have another request if you are both okay with it.”</p><p>The two boys exchanged a look and nodded before Shime stepped even closer. “To make things easier could you read my mind and show the information to all the other members? Like that we will speed up the explanation part a lot.”</p><p>Shime had a good point there and Hokuto moved first putting his hand on the boy’s temple, before Taiga moved his hand to the other side of the boy’s head.</p><p>“Please don’t hold back. I won’t keep any secrets from you.”</p><p>How much had the boy suffered until now through his brother being a Fallen? Taiga had suffered a lot after finding Myuto as a Fallen and here Shime was a Vestige and still couldn’t get close to his brother as he had turned out to be the strongest Fallen they had ever encountered.</p><p>Hokuto wouldn’t be able to share the memories he would receive, yet he could at least receive them directly so Taiga didn’t need to waste time with transferring them to him and as soon as Myuto was awake again he could help as well.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - October</strong>
</p><p>“What do you mean you want to take part in the trial?” Shime asked perplexed, but Taisuke already put his clothes in his bag.</p><p>“What else can I do? We have been losing this war for years now. Daily I see people die. People who have nothing to do with this, friends who fight right next to me. Don’t you want this to end?”</p><p>Of course Shime wanted the war to end, but he also didn’t want to lose his brother. Every single day he left on another mission from the Government he worried sick until he finally walked back through the door. As a family of soldiers, their father had died in the war already and their mum had also lost her life as a nurse on the front line. But while Shime was only helping out inside the bases, Taisuke was on the front line. A pilot, away from him for weeks sometimes and while they had already said that resources got tight and they would soon not be able to fly over the border anymore, that day had not arrived yet. And the thought of him never coming back from one of those missions made Shime emotionally unstable and sometimes he couldn’t even get up in the morning without getting a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I promise to update you as often as I can, okay?” Taisuke said as he walked up to his little brother and put his hand on his cheek with one of his bright smiles. A smile he didn’t see often anymore as the sorrow of the loss of their parents and the ongoing stress of the war was now mainly seen in his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“You know that I will storm the facility if I don’t hear back!” Shime teased and Taisuke placed a kiss on the boy’s hair.</p><p>“Then I guess I have to make sure that you won’t get expelled for that.”</p><p>“Then don’t break your promise,” Shime whispered as he hugged his brother. The last hug he would ever give him…</p><p>The next time he saw his brother was a whole year later and there was absolutely nothing left of that smile he had wished to see again. But Shime had changed as well. A change which he had seen necessary to be able to even get close to his brother. As expected the promised contact had never come and soon after the disappearance of his brother the news of the Fallen had leaked. Shime had immediately known that his brother must have been among those Fallen or he would have come back to him. Unable to get anyone to help him, he tried for months to find Taisuke, but the Government started to hunt them and force them further away from the city. A civil war against the Fallen had started. First Shime had become a Chaser so that he could try and find Taisuke that way. But he soon realized that he wasn’t in any way suited to fight. At least not as a human. So as the Government suddenly established a new experiment and started sending out Vestige to the Centers against the Fallen he volunteered to become one of them.</p><p>On the same day as he had decided to become a Vestige he had met Matsuku who had made the same decision out of almost the same reasons.</p><p>Just two months after his transition Taisuke showed himself again, this time with a group of six followers. He hadn’t come to take the Main Center down, at least not yet. Maybe he wasn’t sure how strong he was himself at that time, but they could all only be grateful that he retreated or they would have all ended up dead.</p><p>Shime tried to stop his brother from running and now he was finally able to at least catch up with him, not that his strength was enough to stop him.</p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Taisuke’s question wasn’t as ridiculous as it should have sounded. What if he joined them? What if a Vestige went with the Fallen? Maybe he could find a better solution for all of them if he knew more about them?</p><p>“Won’t you come back with me instead?” Shime asked, trying to not sound too desperate. Yet the cold smile his brother showed made him tear up. How could he smile and yet be so emotionless? How could the touch on his face that followed, feel so meaningless.</p><p>“Oh, interesting. I can’t copy your special ability.”</p><p>“Maybe you just don’t want to,” Shime said, but what was he saying? His brother was a Fallen. There was nothing stopping him if he wanted to kill his own little brother now.</p><p>“I fear you won’t be of any use to us,” Taisuke said before he walked away from Shime, but once more he reached out for his older brother. What he didn’t expect was Taisuke turning and moving his hand to the boy’s chest. A common shockwave was what should usually hit him as in training Matsuku’s shockwave had hit him several times as well. But nothing happened and Taisuke lifted an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>“Interesting. Maybe you should join us after all. We could do a lot of research together.”</p><p>Shime shook his head and stepped back, not even having the mindset of using his immunity against Taisuke’s ability to attack his brother. “I wish I would have stopped you that day.”</p><p>“Oh boy, then I would be one of so many dead soldiers by now.”</p><p>“I might prefer that,” Shime let out, not even knowing how such cruel words left his mouth.</p><p>Taisuke seemed to get angry at his words, but before he could do anything, there were sirens heard from the Main Center and a lot of backup was on their way.</p><p>“Then maybe this should remain our last encounter. But be prepared, if you stay with the Government I won’t show you any mercy next time.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>“I remember that attack on the Main Center,” Kochi said after Taiga had come to the lab to show Kochi and Aran what Shime had shown him and Hokuto. He wasn’t able to go through all his memories at once and there were so many linked memories with the other boys that he needed to concentrate on the important parts for now.</p><p>“They told the other Centers to be on backup in case things escalate. They never gave us details about the Fallen who attacked though. But knowing that they had only shown up to scare the Government and make clear that they would be back with a real attack I wonder what the Main Center was thinking? The loss of so many lives at the East Center could have easily been prevented.”</p><p>“I wonder what would have happened if Myuto’s group had challenged Taisuke on their first encounter,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded.</p><p>“Most likely we would have all ended up dead,” Myuto was heard from the open lab door and Aran stood up, hurrying over to him.</p><p>“Are you alright? How are you feeling?”</p><p>“All good. I heard from Reo about Shime and the others. At least the summary.”</p><p>“I can give you the rest of the details,” Taiga offered and Myuto nodded before he lowered his hand from Aran’s cheek to take his hand and squeeze it.</p><p>“You should take a rest. I know you are worried, but you can’t lock yourself in the lab for days.”</p><p>“Could you stay out of my mind?” Aran teased, but of course he knew that the other one was worried and he definitely needed some sleep after they researched on the Reverse serum for this long. “Is Kentaro still asleep?”</p><p>Myuto nodded, but he wasn’t that worried. “Let’s talk to Yuma and the others for now.”</p><p>Aran nodded and left the lab first.</p><p>Myuto turned to Taiga after Aran had left. “You mind?”</p><p>Taiga nodded and stretched out his hand towards Myuto’s face. One part of Shime’s memory that surprised Myuto the same way as Taiga was that Taisuke seemed to completely remember everything from his life as a human. Was he that strong that he could easily deal with his past without his instincts trying to shut them out? For now they wouldn’t get to know.</p><p> It was so much faster to put memories into someone’s mind than talking things through, but Taiga still didn’t want to use this ability too much. It felt like there was still a lot about his own abilities he didn’t know. He felt that his abilities were the same as Myuto’s and if he wanted to he could actually block people’s memories and maybe even alter them, so that they would end up like Aran before. Something he never wanted to even try out.</p><p>***</p><p>“I wish I could take all the stress out of your mind.”</p><p>Hokuto’s words made Taiga turn to the boy who was lying with his back against the backrest with a few pillows behind his back, while Taiga had just sat down with an obvious way too loud sigh.</p><p>“Maybe Myuto could if I ask him?”</p><p>“But I doubt you would?”</p><p>And Hokuto was right, after all their abilities weren’t there to take away headaches or stress. But Taiga couldn’t deny that he felt extremely exhausted after this one day already and there was going to be a lot of chaos waiting for them that was for sure.</p><p>“Do you want to look further into Shime’s memories tomorrow?”</p><p>Taiga shook his head and crawled more onto the bed, resting his head on the other one’s chest as Hokuto invitingly stretched out his arm and played with Taiga’s hair now that he had settled down.</p><p>“I think tomorrow we should leave them all alone for a bit. Kentaro went straight to Yuma and the others when he woke up without even speaking to them and with Aran preparing the serum for them in the morning I think there will be enough chaos.”</p><p>“It fascinates me how they still follow Myuto even though his mind set is now so different,” Hokuto let out, his look absentmindedly on Taiga’s face.</p><p>“He is still as strong as before and they could have easily run over to Taisuke if they thought he was a more fitting leader.”</p><p>“Luckily that will be one less thing to worry about from tomorrow,” Hokuto said relieved and Taiga reached out for the other one’s hand and turned more on his back while he caressed the back of Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>“When you still had to deal with your Fallen self, did you ever feel how he was looking for a strong leader too?”</p><p>“You mean because he wanted to run over to Myuto?”</p><p>Taiga nodded while Hokuto’s hand stopped its movement in Taiga’s hair before he put on a thoughtful expression. “I never really felt his emotions in that way, so I am not sure if he was really looking for leadership or if he just wanted to break free from me.”</p><p>Taiga only nodded once more while both his hands were now putting a bit pressure on Hokuto’s hand and the boy raised an eyebrow at him. “Why did you want to know about this?”</p><p>“Mh? Oh, no specific reason. I think I am just worried that someone could still run over to Taisuke.”</p><p>“Like who? You?”</p><p>Taiga should laugh now, right? Yet he didn’t and Hokuto shifted a bit to be able to look at the other one more directly, but Taiga looked up at him and bit his lip. “That’s a joke, right? You got a serum, which should have actually turned you into a Vestige and just through my Fallen self you got his abilities. Your mind set is in no way the same as a Fallen.”</p><p>“Yet I am a Fallen, Kochi said so too.”</p><p>“And Myuto and the others are also still Fallen and they would never follow Taisuke. They almost died together with us fighting him. Is there something you aren’t telling me?”</p><p>Of course Hokuto would easily catch up with the situation and Taiga finally got up and sat down next to Hokuto, letting his head drop on the other one’s shoulder and luckily the younger one didn’t pull away. “I know I might just be overreacting, because I am so stressed and honestly quite scared about what Taisuke could do to our Center and the Government if he attacks with the Fallen following him.”</p><p>“But?” Hokuto asked, knowing that Taiga would never just start such a serious topic without any good reason.</p><p>“So much unused potential.”</p><p>Taiga’s words made Hokuto raise an eyebrow, but before he could shift away, Taiga hooked his arm with the other one. “Taisuke said that to me when he read my mind.”</p><p>“So what? You think there is still something going on in your mind? Don’t you think Kochi would have realized that by now? Even I couldn't find anything.”</p><p>“It does sound like I am overreacting, right?”</p><p>“It sounds damn scary,” Hokuto said to Taiga’s surprise and with the next move Hokuto placed a kiss on the other one’s hair and pulled him closer. “As long as you don’t hide anything from me or Kochi, I think you should be good? My Fallen self was able to communicate with me, so in case you ever feel like something is going on in your mind we can always run tests, you know? No matter how much our tests proved that you should be perfectly fine.”</p><p>Taiga was grateful that the other one didn’t make fun out of him over such a ridiculous worry, after all he wasn’t hiding anything. But his own weird reaction towards Taisuke on their first encounter and Taisuke’s words somehow made him worry that he wasn’t hiding something, but that something was hiding from him.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Moro, a Fallen that can take away all basic abilities of a Vestige or Fallen through a simple touch, yet his past was marked with blood. His own blood. Always cheerful and showing a smile to his two little cousins he grew up with, after losing his own parents in an attack, when he was still a baby. Yet the war took away the rest of his family as well. Unable to cope with his loss he tried to take his own life. Becoming a Fallen hadn’t been his choice, but now he got a second chance to show his cheerful smile once more.</p><p>Hagi, soundwaves that would paralyze his opponents and take away their ability to find their balance, yet he had always helped children rebalance their lives after losing their loved ones. Until one day he lost them all in an air raid. Losing the ability to believe in human kindness he decided to become stronger to protect those who couldn’t do so themselves. Now he was finally given the chance to do so.</p><p>Yuma, with the ability of overpowering almost everyone with his shockwaves, he possessed the ability to end fights in an instant. Yet he hated fighting, hated violence and wished for nothing more than the end of the war. Unable to remain at the sideline he put his morals aside to fight for the sake of peace. A peaceful era, which he could now help create.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising to Taiga that after the third person he was unable to get up by himself and Hokuto stepped on the platform in the lab to help Taiga get up.</p><p>“I told you to take breaks in between,” Hokuto scolded him.</p><p>Taiga took his hand with a sheepish nod, but then he formed a smile when he looked at the others. “I think it was worth the hurry.”</p><p>All three remaining Fallen had finally received the serum and Aran had also somehow managed to make it at least a bit less painful so that they wouldn’t faint easily anymore, yet Taiga had still offered to help them through it and they had all agreed.</p><p>“Their smiles are beautiful,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded as he watched how Myuto hugged every single one of them. They were all a bit shaken through all the memories Taiga had woken up again, but they were all smiling. There was so much gratitude and hope shining in their eyes now and Taiga wished they could just forget about Taisuke threatening everyone’s new found happiness.</p><p>“Let’s give them a moment,” Hokuto said and left the lab together with Taiga and stopped at the training room where Juri was training with the others to see how skilled they were.</p><p>Hokuto pulled Taiga out of the way right before Umi landed next to them. The others in the room were only the Chasers of their group, so they seemed to have some trouble with Juri even with four against one, but Taiga could understand that as he had faced Vestige and Fallen as a Chaser often enough.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Taiga asked when the boy was up again and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>“All good, only my ego is hurt.”</p><p>“To get such a big ego you should train harder,” Noel scolded him when Juri told them to take a break.</p><p>“Well there can only be one ace after all,” Chaka laughed, but the truth was that if he concentrated a bit more he could also become a quite good Chaser, but he was too chaotic for that.</p><p>“Never let him enter a battle in the same team as Shintaro,” Hokuto said towards Noel who didn’t know much about their Chasers yet, but he gave him a teasing smile obviously understanding that it would be a chaotic choice.</p><p>“Who is the strongest Chaser in your Center?” Shizu asked and Juri pointed at Taiga. “Until he got turned it was Taiga.”</p><p>“Really?” Umi asked, a bit disbelieving. “And here I thought you were as bad as Shizu and that is why you turned.”</p><p>“Let’s say I had a good reason to get stronger,” Taiga said and gave Hokuto a side-glance.</p><p>“Oh, I see, no more questions,” Noel said, getting the hint while Chaka raised an eyebrow at them.</p><p>“What do you see? I don’t get it.”</p><p>“Ask Hokuto I bet he will definitely explain the details to you,” Juri said with a teasing smile towards his friend before he left the training room to meet with Shime and the other Vestige.</p><p>Chaka turned to the one in question, but before he could even voice out anything, Hokuto pointed at him. “I swear I’ll make you regret any question, so zip it!”</p><p>Chaka got the threat faster than the hint so he pressed his lips together and hid a bit behind Shizu.</p><p>“So I think we are done for today then?” Umi said and already headed out to the corridor, when he stopped. “Oh, one of the Fallen is here. What was his name, Kentaro?”</p><p>Taiga turned towards the corridor and he was surprised to find Kentaro alone as he had been with Reo, Myuto and the others in the lab until a few moments ago. After he had finally woken up again he had only met with the other Fallen and had been to the lab, so he hadn’t gotten the time to talk directly to the boys who helped them out. But something on his face made Taiga tense as he didn’t seem in talking mood.</p><p>“Out of my way,” Kentaro hissed and Umi almost jumped out of the way.</p><p>“Didn’t you say he got the serum already?” Noel asked, but Hokuto could only shrug his shoulders.</p><p>“It helps with bringing them back to their senses, but they won’t change their personality.”</p><p>“So no taking Kentaro lightly it is then,” Noel said as he was able to analyze him already.</p><p>“Where the fuck is he?” Kentaro growled, but Taiga could only lift an eyebrow at him and the others also didn’t know who he was talking about.</p><p>Noel looked at Umi, but he shook his head, then he turned to Shizu who shrugged his shoulders, but then he realized that Chaka had completely hidden behind him.</p><p>“Chaka, what are you doing?” Noel asked, but on that question Chaka gave him a scolding look and put his finger in front of his own lips.</p><p>“YOU!” Kentaro shouted and Shizu immediately stepped away from Chaka as he realized that he wasn’t the one in question.</p><p>“What is going on?” Taiga asked a bit panicked, but something told him that he shouldn’t interfere, for now.</p><p>“Wait, I can explain,” Chaka said as he started running backwards when Kentaro approached him with big steps.</p><p>“Have you ever met Kentaro?” Hokuto asked, but Noel shook his head. “Not as long as I know Chaka.”</p><p>With a gasp Chaka hit the wall of the training room now out of running space and he seemed so stressed out that Taiga was on high alert. He doubted that Kentaro would rip him to pieces no matter his anger, but he still wondered what was going on.</p><p>“Ken-chan, let me explain. Please…” Chaka begged, stretching out his arms, obviously more than afraid of what Kentaro could do.</p><p>“Ken-chan?” Taiga asked with a raised eyebrow. Chaka had seen Kentaro when they rescued them, yet he had stayed with everyone in the West Center so things couldn’t be that bad, could they?”</p><p>“There is no need to explain anything,” Kentaro said, his words more threatening than soothing and Chaka almost curled up on the ground when Kentaro grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>“Ehm, okay...now I don’t get anything anymore,” Umi whispered after the whole room had fallen silent the moment Kentaro had pulled Chaka into a hug.</p><p>“Do you put them on drugs or something with that serum?” Shizu whispered towards Hokuto and received a punch against the shoulder from Noel for that stupid comment.</p><p>Chaka didn’t react for a moment with his eyes still wide open in panic and his hands slightly shaking. “You don’t have to explain anything,” Kentaro repeated when he put one hand up to the latter’s back and squeezed him even more. “All I needed to know is that you are safe, you damn son of a bitch.”</p><p>That statement finally made Chaka tear up and hug the other one back, desperately clenching his hands into the back of the other one’s shirt. “I am so sorry for disappearing like that.”</p><p>“He is not his brother, is he?” Hokuto whispered towards Taiga, but he shook his head. He had seen his brother and he was older. But he also hadn’t seen all the memories of course, so most likely he was someone he had lost sight of in the war.</p><p>“Guys, do you want to let us be part of the celebration or not?” Noel asked after giving them a moment to calm down and Chaka hurried to wipe away some tears with his sleeve, before he squeezed Kentaro’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ken-chan and I have been friends since childhood. Our parents were neighbors,” Chaka explained.</p><p>“Then why did he storm in here as if he wanted to kill you?” Umi asked perplexed.</p><p>“Well, Ken-chan always scolded me when I was younger. I got into trouble a lot, often vanished without letting anyone know where I was going and one day…”</p><p>“One day this asshole just didn’t come back,” Kentaro finished for him.</p><p>“Could you stop insulting me?”</p><p>“Never, you moron,” Kentaro teased and ruffled through the other one’s hair.</p><p>“Well, I would be pissed and happy at the same time too if I suddenly found someone who had disappeared like this,” Noel said.</p><p>“Why did you disappear?” Shizu asked and Chaka looked quite embarrassed through the question.</p><p>“I was a way too carefree kid and I loved playing with Ken-chan, his sister and brother, but one day none of them were home and I randomly started searching for them. I know that was stupid, I was still too young and naive to realize how dangerous it was to wander around alone as a child. At some point I didn’t know the way home anymore and just stood there in between all the buildings for hours, waiting for someone to find me. A sudden air raid made everything even more chaotic and in the end I found myself in an orphanage as I had obviously lost consciousness. I tried to explain to them that I had a family and after a few days we were finally able to find my house, but…”</p><p>“But it was too late,” Kentaro said with a dark expression. “That air raid had hit our neighborhood. It killed your parents and my sister.”</p><p>“I thought all this time that you had died as well,” Chaka let out with new tears shining in his eyes. “But when I met your brother again I wondered if you had survived too.”</p><p>First that statement hung in the air for a moment until Kentaro looked up with wide eyes. “What did you just say?”</p><p>Now everyone’s attention was on Chaka who lifted a hand to his mouth as if he just realized that he had said something he shouldn’t have. Even Noel and the others didn’t seem to know.</p><p>“I- I know I need to explain this, but-”</p><p>“Then do. Chaka, where is he?” Kentaro asked and shook him on the shoulders, but Chaka seemed more than reluctant to reply. “Don’t you get how amazing this news is?”</p><p>Kentaro’s excitement wasn’t shared by Chaka and when Hokuto gave Taiga a worried side glance he felt a heavy stone sinking in his stomach. Taiga reached out for the other one’s face and in silence they confirmed what they were both thinking. He was alive, which was indeed good news, but maybe the rest wasn’t as exciting as Kentaro wished it to be…</p><p>“Do you know how happy I was when I saw your name on the list of new members in the lab earlier? I couldn’t believe that you were still alive and now you tell me that you even met my brother? Was he in your Center? Where is he now?”</p><p>Chaka kept looking to the floor, unable to reply, but his silence made Kentaro shake him even more until he finally had enough and grabbed the other one’s hands. “I can’t tell you.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Kentaro asked a bit more calmly this time.</p><p>“Can we talk about this later? I was so happy to find you with the others the other day. Do you know how happy I am that you are alive? Even though you had become a Fallen you got the chance to start over and this is amazing and just for now I want to be happy.”</p><p>His words made Kentaro take a few steps back and then he finally caught up with Chaka’s reaction, with his gloomy look and his attempts to change the topic.</p><p>“No, this can’t be…” Kentaro slowly shook his head.</p><p>Shizu tugged on Noel’s sleeve, but the older one lifted his hand, not wanting to give him any explanations now.</p><p>“He promised to come back on that day…” Kentaro whispered and for the first time there was such hurt visible on Kentaro’s face that Taiga wished he could take away his emotions to give him some peace of mind. “Nika...why…”</p><p>There were so many open questions, yet to their surprise Kentaro got a grip once more and clenched his hands until his fists were shaking and Chaka flinched when he looked up.</p><p>“Where is he now?”</p><p>It was obvious that Chaka didn’t have any other details about Nika, Kentaro’s older brother, but at least his whereabouts he knew. But alone that information could shatter Kentaro even more, yet it was clear that he wouldn’t let it pass in silence and finally Chaka took another deep breath.</p><p>“He is with Taisuke.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Kentaro, we can’t just go and look for him. We have no clue where he is,” Kochi tried to calm down the other one, but Kentaro didn’t even listen to him and only rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest as almost the whole Center had blocked his way.</p><p>After Chaka had told him that his older brother had ended up as a Fallen with Taisuke he had decided to go find him, but of course his idea had been cut short when Myuto got to hear about what had happened and made sure to drag him back into the training room before he could actually storm out of the Center all on his own.</p><p>“I am not a member of this Center, nor a puppet of the Government, I am grateful for your help with the serum and also for Chaka and the others helping out, but this is something I have to do alone.”</p><p>When he tried to get out of the room once more, the other Fallen blocked his way and Reo was the one to walk up to him. “After what we have done over all these years don’t you think you know the outcome already if you find him?”</p><p>“He is my brother,” Kentaro growled at him in annoyance.</p><p>“And Taisuke is Shime’s brother, yet he doesn’t storm out, knowing that it doesn’t make any sense to do so without a plan,” Myuto said while Shime and the others had gone a bit on distance, not wanting to interfere.</p><p>“Shime is no Fallen,” Kentaro countered.</p><p>“And yet Nika will just see you as the same enemy he sees in everyone else,” Taiga spoke up to everyone’s surprise. “Even after I became a Fallen, Myuto still tried to kill me.”</p><p>The truth of these words made Myuto’s look darken, but Kentaro didn’t want to listen.</p><p>“I am well aware of what will await me, but that won’t stop me from going,” Kentaro said and when Reo tried to put his hand on the other one’s shoulder he slashed it away with a warning look.</p><p>“Can’t you wait at least a few more days? We can come up with a plan where to look for them and how to approach them more carefully?” Juri interfered.</p><p>“I don’t need a plan and I don’t need you with me,” Kentaro hissed and passed Reo, but this time Myuto stepped in his way and before Kentaro could lift a hand the other one had pushed him to the back, making Kentaro growl at the other one.</p><p>“You are still part of my team though and I won’t allow you to go,” Myuto ordered, showing that he was as serious about stopping Kentaro as the other one was about leaving.</p><p>“Fine,” Kentaro said, suddenly forming a snappy smile as he turned away and stopped in the middle of the training room and spread his arms. “Then let’s settle this the old fashioned way.”</p><p>“What does he mean?” Shintaro whispered, while he and Jesse kept hiding a bit behind Taiga and Hokuto.</p><p>“You’ll see in a second,” Hokuto let out while he crossed his arms to his chest with a sigh. “Do you think we have to interfere?”</p><p>The question was for Taiga and he looked quite troubled and wasn’t sure if he wanted to nod or not, because the truth was that he could understand why Kentaro wanted to go and also why he tried to leave the others out of it. Kentaro wasn’t as egoistic as he wanted to make the others believe after all.</p><p>“Fine, if you think this is necessary,” Myuto said and stepped in front of Kentaro while the others slowly retreated to the side of the training room, knowing what was coming.</p><p>Between Fallen an argument would usually get settled through a fight and the serum wouldn’t change that kind of thinking for them.</p><p>“I won’t hold back,” Kentaro warned.</p><p>“You better don’t or you won’t have a single unbroken bone left to leave the Center for the next few days,” Myuto warned.</p><p>“I will walk out these gates no matter what,” Kentaro hissed before he dashed to the front, but Myuto hadn’t been bluffing and he lifted his hand, making Kentaro stop with a curse as he couldn’t move freely for a moment, but he was stronger than most of them had expect and Chaka bit his lip in worry as Kentaro screamed at his body to move and he was able to approach Myuto fast enough to make the other one go on distance. Myuto didn’t have to fear Kentaro’s shockwaves, yet his special ability was something that could make him lose.</p><p>“Don’t make me go all out on you,” Myuto warned, but Kentaro just gritted his teeth and sped up once more, breaking completely through Myuto’s motion control this time.</p><p>First Myuto tried to stay on distance until he could recharge, but Kentaro’s anger made it way easier for him to break through that ability so in the end Myuto dared to step into Kentaro’s reach.</p><p>The smaller one tried immediately to get his hands on the other one’s skin, but Myuto was faster than him and he grabbed Kentaro’s wrist and twisted his arm on his back before he reached out for his face. But the time it took for Myuto to try and control Kentaro’s mind, was enough for Kentaro to lift his free hand and reach out for Myuto’s hand. Before anything could happen, the taller one jumped away, leaving Kentaro laughing at him.</p><p>“If you want to stop me then you should use your pain infliction instead of your mind control. You won’t have enough time to get into my mind.”</p><p>“If you want to lose that fast then I can do you that favor,” Myuto said dead serious as he wasn’t happy about hurting a friend, yet he wouldn’t let him run out there into his own death.</p><p>Once more Kentaro took a run up at the other one, but knowing that he couldn’t use his shockwaves and with Myuto on high alert about his special ability, he went for kicks and punches instead.</p><p>But once more Myuto was still the faster one and he could use his shockwaves, so with the next attack Kentaro got thrown through the room and crashed into the wall with a gasp.</p><p>Everyone else remained on distance, not even Reo tried to argue with him. It was clear that he had to lose or he wouldn’t get stopped.</p><p>“Kentaro, you know that we will stop you know matter what,” Myuto reminded him. “Even if you somehow win against me, you need to go through them all to leave.”</p><p>“Then I will win against them as well,” Kentaro shouted after he got up again. “Why do you even care? I never asked any of you to go with me. Just leave me alone!”</p><p>“You know exactly that we would never do that,” Myuto said with a slightly hurt expression while Kentaro got ready for another attack.</p><p>This time Kentaro went all out, ready to put all his remaining energy in defeating Myuto, but his leader wasn’t going to lose just so he didn’t have to hurt his friend, so in the end Myuto went for the one attack he didn’t want to use as Kentaro kept fighting like a wild animal.</p><p>In between Kentaro’s shouting and punching, Myuto lifted his hand, making Kentaro slow down enough to stretch his hand out and grab the other one’s neck. Kentaro immediately reached out for Myuto’s wrists, but this time Myuto’s ability was faster than the other ones as he wasn’t going for mind control.</p><p>With a scream Kentaro went to his knees, but Myuto wouldn’t let go of him as he knew that he needed to make him surrender completely or he would just keep fighting.</p><p>To his surprise Kentaro was still strong enough to use his own ability and soon Myuto gasped on the pain in his chest, which would soon rip his blood system apart if he didn’t hurry.</p><p>“This is for your own good,” Myuto said as he went full out on the other one and in the middle of another scream the room fell silent as Kentaro fell to the back. Myuto was fast enough to move one hand around his back so he wouldn’t hit the ground and Reo hurried towards them and sat down next to Kentaro.</p><p>“Why won’t you just leave me alone,” Kentaro let out in a weak voice, not even opening his eyes, while Myuto got up with a judging look towards him.</p><p>“Because as much as you want us to believe that you want to go alone, because it’s your family problem, we won’t sit back and watch you getting killed, just because you want to keep us away from the fight.”</p><p>Of course Myuto had realized as well why Kentaro wanted to leave in such a hurry, but he wasn’t the only one who wanted to settle things with those Fallen following Taisuke.</p><p>“I know I can’t get him back,” Kentaro let out in an unsteady voice and it was Reo who looked ready to cry the next second. “I don’t want to go to get him back. I want to go to punch him in the face and yell at him for being so selfish and leaving me behind.”</p><p>“I know,” Myuto whispered, clenching his fists. “But how about you trust us instead?”</p><p>This time Kentaro finally opened his eyes, but didn’t get up. Myuto gave him a serious look before he let his eyes wander through the room. “All of these people here in this room have done so much for us and are still trying to help all the other Fallen out there. Chaka and the others have the same right as you to be angry, disappointed or sad about the Fallen following Taisuke, yet they didn’t give in to their emotions. Instead they are all here to help, so for once how about you put your trust in someone else?”</p><p>Not only as a Fallen was Kentaro a lone wolf, but he had been different before losing his family and turning into a Fallen, but it was hard to put his trust into someone, especially when the situation seemed hopeless.</p><p>When Myuto suddenly stepped aside, Kentaro looked up at Chaka who had slowly walked up to them and gave Kentaro an unsure look. “I know as a Chaser I can’t do much, but I trust these guys as much as you trust your leader and the other Fallen,” Chaka explained while looking over at Shime and the others. “I was shocked when I saw Nika as a Fallen. I wanted to take him by the collar and yell at him why he hadn’t protected his family. But it was Shime who taught me how important it was to think rationally and be patient, because you are wrong. You can get him back.”</p><p>Chaka’s direct words had everyone look at the boy, but it brought supporting looks instead of disbelief, because they knew that he was right. Kentaro was just too outraged to see the hope!</p><p>“We have the Reverse serum, we have Fallen on our side, a whole Center behind us and if you give us a bit of time and your trust we can definitely come up with a plan to get Taisuke, Nika and the others back on our side too.”</p><p>When Chaka stretched his arm out towards the older one, Kentaro hesitated for a moment and bit his lip, but when he looked up at Reo, the boy gave him a bright and supportive smile, while Myuto also seemed to have waited for him to finally see past his anger.</p><p>“Under one condition,” Kentaro said, making Chaka raise an eyebrow, but the next second Kentaro had reached out for his hand already and let the other one drag him back on his feet. “I will personally train you before we go out to look for him, because at the moment you would be the first one in this group to die out there.”</p><p>While Chaka pouted, the others in the back started laughing and Shizu hit Noel as he said that he would die with him. But in the end Chaka formed a smile and nodded.</p><p>“As long as you are not the one killing me at that training already.”</p><p>“I can’t promise that.”</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>"Two more days," Aran announced.</p><p>"But didn't you just say you completed the upgrade for the Reverse serum for the use on the battlefield?" Hagi asked.</p><p>"Yes the serum is not the problem, but you need to train more on how to get close enough to them to even get a chance to use it," Kochi explained.</p><p>"Chaka is ready to beat the shit out of them," Kentaro announced proudly.</p><p>"I'd say Chaka looks like the shit was beaten out of him instead," Shintaro whispered towards Jesse who giggled, but zipped it when Kentaro gave them a dangerous look.</p><p>"Anyway, the system is easy," Aran explained as he lifted the metal tube in his hand. "All you have to do is bring it down on their skin for at least two seconds. There is no button to activate it as it automatically shoots the needle out when in contact with a Fallen. The system is similar to the first version of the Cricket. But be careful even though the canister is hard to break it’s not Dragnacit, so a Fallen will be able to destroy it."</p><p>"We should have just put it in a bullet and shoot them. Wouldn't that be safer?" Jesse asked and it wasn't a bad idea but it wasn't that easy either.</p><p>"We're too fast to easily get shot," Myuto explained. "And it would be a waste of serum."</p><p>"Will anything happen if the serum gets used against us?" Taiga asked, but Kochi shook his head.</p><p>"It's only attacking original Fallen DNA and we analyzed every possible outcome. Taiga, your DNA was different from the start so it wouldn't affect you at all, except your DNA would somehow change."</p><p>"But don't forget that for this first patrol all we want is to find their hideout," Juri reminded them. "Just if we get discovered and end up in a fight with them we will use the serum."</p><p>Kentaro didn't look too thrilled about that plan, but he had lost against Myuto so now he had to go with what they were planning. A whole week had already passed and he was getting restless.</p><p>"So we're training how to use the tube in the most effective way starting tomorrow?" Hokuto asked and Kochi nodded.</p><p>"Two days should be enough to get everyone's teamwork on a good level."</p><p>"Teamwork?" Reo asked a bit perplex.</p><p>"We'll head out in teams, so we will start training in exactly those teams."</p><p>Aran's words had them all a bit tense as it was obvious that they had thought the Fallen would go on their own, then Shime's team and then a West Center team.</p><p>"Well, the teams are definitely stronger when we combine a few strong abilities," Yuma agreed.</p><p>"Are you sending Chasers out too?" Moro asked, but it didn't seem like he felt offended by Kochi's nod. Usually Fallen wouldn't care to protect Chasers on the battlefield, but they understood that it was their fight too.</p><p>"Let's keep the details for tomorrow, okay? It's late you should all rest," Kochi suggested and they dismissed the meeting in the lab.</p><p>"Do you think we'll be on the same team?" Taiga asked on the way back to their room. Now that so many people were staying at their Center, Taiga had offered to move to Hokuto’s room for now so that his room could get used for others.</p><p>"You know the answer already, don't you?" Hokuto said with a gloomy look as he closed the room door behind them and went straight for the cupboard to change clothes.</p><p>"I'll take a shower," Taiga said and Hokuto couldn't blame him for being tense. Even with them only wanting to spot their location this mission was more than dangerous. They had to protect their own Center, be ready for other Fallen to attack while they were gone or in the worst case for Taisuke to be faster than them and attack them instead.</p><p>Remembering how badly they had lost against Taisuke, Taiga let out a sigh as he stepped under the hot water and put his forehead against the cold stone wall.</p><p>For days he just couldn't see a way to win and he wondered how the others could just keep going with their training like this.</p><p>After realizing after a while that his endlessly racing thoughts wouldn’t bring him anywhere and not wanting to waste precious water and keep Hokuto waiting for his turn he finally turned around, but that was the moment when he realized that he was indeed way too distracted. So distracted that he hadn't even realized the presence right behind him. Luckily for him it was no enemy, but the other one still attacked him.</p><p>Hokuto didn't say anything, instead he lifted his hand to Taiga's jawline and pushed his head a bit to the back, before he pressed him against the wall and gave him a rushed yet passionate kiss.</p><p>The running water didn't disturb them and Taiga's hands immediately reached out around the other one's hips, finding a lot of skin to grope on his way down.</p><p>"You want to switch to the bedroom?" Hokuto whispered against his lips, but all Taiga was capable of doing was shaking his head. This was exactly the type of distraction he needed and he needed it now!</p><p>Hokuto was luckily able to read the need in his eyes and their next kiss already mixed with moans while Hokuto used the advantage of the running water to prepare Taiga without even moving out of their position.</p><p>When Taiga bit the other one on the bottom lip, signaling his impatience, Hokuto lifted the other one up. Taiga closed his legs around the younger ones back and kept his arms hanging loose around his neck, while Hokuto pressed him more into the wall. For them it wasn't much of an effort to keep this position and Taiga would do it in whatever position for now.</p><p>"Hurry up," Taiga complained and clawed his fingers into the other one's shoulders as Hokuto did exactly what he was asked to do.</p><p>Their touches were impatient, Hokuto's thrusts so rough that Taiga ended up as a moaning mess way too soon and even though Hokuto wasn't able to help him out in this position he didn't care. This messed up situation was enough to make Taiga come on his own and he rested with his head against the wall, the water feeling like needles on his skin.</p><p>Hokuto let him down so that he could relax for a moment, but then he turned him around and Taiga was feeling still too weak on his legs to complain.</p><p>"If you go without me then you have to go again," Hokuto whispered next to his ear and bit in his earlobe when he pushed in from behind.</p><p>This time the sound Taiga let out was more of a whine as he wasn't yet completely down from his first climax.</p><p>Hokuto used that to his advantage though and closed his hand around Taiga, making the other one breathe in sharp on the way too sudden second stimulation.</p><p>"Come again for me," Hokuto whispered before he bit Taiga on the neck and the older one threw his head to the back, one hand reaching out for Hokuto's face. Even with the weird angle he still demanded s kiss and Hokuto was more than willing to give it to him. Once more he seemed busier with Taiga than with himself and Taiga had to pull back with a high pitched moan as Hokuto made him come once more. This time though Hokuto started thrusting more desperately, not giving Taiga the time to relax yet. Finally able to come as well, Hokuto put a hand to the wall to stabilize himself while taking a few erratic breaths.</p><p>Taiga used that moment to turn around and put his hands on the other one's chest before he gave him another passionate kiss, which made Hokuto feel way too aroused once more.</p><p>"Do you plan on keeping going for the whole night?" Hokuto asked with his own lips already back on the other one’s face, before he was even able to answer.</p><p>The way Taiga melted into the upcoming kiss and had his hands greedily over the other one's body, while Hokuto deepened the kiss until all he wanted was to take it further once more, it was clear that yes they would keep doing this for a while.</p><p>"From tomorrow on we'll be pretty busy and most likely not even training together, so yes I won't leave you alone tonight," Taiga said, his voice already sounding a bit husky.</p><p>"Then let's make sure we're not using the whole water while we do so," Hokuto said with a lopsided smile as he turned off the water and grabbed a towel, throwing it over the smaller one's head.</p><p>It was ridiculous how easily Taiga had thrown all his worries out of the window, but just for another night he wanted to pretend like they could go on like always!</p><p>***</p><p>"Okay so we will send out four teams and have one back up team here in the Center. We also will have some people remain in the Center in case other Centers are in trouble or if we get attacked," Kochi explained the next day when they all met in the training room.</p><p>Most of the West Center's Chasers had already decided to stay behind and take care of the Center and possible emergencies, but Jesse and Shintaro wanted to help out.</p><p>"Anyone who wants to stay behind voluntarily?"</p><p>Kochi's question had made them all look at each other until one Vestige stepped to the front. "My abilities are more useful here."</p><p>Juri's words made Kochi nod and he noted Juri's name down as backup.</p><p>"We don't want the worst case to happen, but in case a team needs help it's definitely a good idea to have you on it so you can help out with recharging their abilities."</p><p>"I'll stay behind with Juri," Noel announced. "My strength lies in analyzing so I can give advice to the teams from here."</p><p>"I'll stay here too," Shizu announced and while it was clear how much he would like to go out with one of the teams, he didn't want to be a burden. Not that they were trying to get into any head on fight this time.</p><p>"Okay so then we only need one more Fallen or Vestige who will stay at the Center for other emergencies."</p><p>"I'll do it."</p><p>To their surprise it was Yuma who volunteered.</p><p>"I'm a strong fighter, but as we're not aiming for a direct fight this time and the Center is our base, which needs to be protected as well, I will make sure everyone has a safe place to return to."</p><p>It was obvious how grateful Shime and the others who were directly involved with Taisuke, were for his choice.</p><p>"Okay then let's start forming the remaining teams so that you can start your training," Kochi announced. But it seemed like he had already decided the teams depending on who would stay behind.</p><p>"Every team will have a team leader. They will stay in contact with me and the others who stay behind."</p><p>"Means as much as don't dare to do something they didn't approve of," Kentaro said, knowing already that this was what they needed of course, but it also meant he wouldn't be a team leader, because he wasn't calm enough for that.</p><p>"Okay so the first team's leader is Myuto." Kochi announced.</p><p>That came to no one's surprise neither did the name he put under it on the board.</p><p>"Kentaro you have one of the strongest direct abilities and in combination with Myuto who can control from the distance, you're a strong team."</p><p>"And I can't run off doing something stupid," Kentaro added mockingly.</p><p>"The other two members on your team will be Matsuku and Chaka."</p><p>"Now I have to babysit?" Kentaro said, looking at Chaka, but to his surprise his friend went up to him and put his hand on his shoulder. "No, you're going to get babysitted."</p><p>While everyone else chuckled, Kentaro let out a dangerous growl on which Chaka went a bit on distance. But it was after all a good idea to have Chaka on the team to talk Kentaro back to his senses in case Myuto would be busy fighting and Matsuku could take a neutral spot in the team as long as he would react calmly if they met the Fallen he was looking for.</p><p>"Okay then the second team Leader is Hokuto."</p><p>Again no one was surprised, because as much as Hokuto could be stubborn he could also be calm and would definitely think before acting, at least as long as Taiga wasn't on his team.</p><p>"The other members on your team will be Hagiya, Shintaro and Jesse. Hagiya can keep the Fallen on distance and you two-"</p><p>Kochi turned to the two Chasers in question. "Are too chaotic to leave you with anyone other than Hokuto."</p><p>Shintaro pouted and got ready to complain, but one look from Hokuto made him shut up.</p><p>"Look, it’s already working," Juri let out with a chuckle.</p><p>"The third team leader is Genta," Kochi announced and put three more names down. "Reo you can help them get away whenever necessary. Moro can help in case they get into close range and I heard Umi is quite skilled with close combat."</p><p>"No one on the team complained, but Reo seemed a bit disappointed that he didn't get a leader role.</p><p>"The last team's leader is Aran," Kochi announced and this time all of them looked more than confused.</p><p>"You're going?" Myuto asked, obviously not having talked about this with Aran.</p><p>"If I had told you, then you would have complained, right?"</p><p>"I still complain now," Myuto let out, but Kochi asked them all to calm down again.</p><p>"He'll be with Shime and Taiga so he'll be fine."</p><p>"And he is a really good strategist and knows how to fight Fallen the best, right?" Juri added and slowly Myuto calmed down, but the same as with Taiga and Hokuto it was definitely a good choice to not have him together with Aran on the same team.</p><p>"Okay, then the teams are set. You have two days to get a good teamwork and then we head out," Kochi explained.</p><p>It took a moment for everyone to split up in their groups and Shime approached Taiga with a careful look.</p><p>"I'm sorry that we put so much pressure on you."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Aran is the leader and I don't doubt that he is a skilled fighter, but we are only a team of three and while I can heal and am immune against Taisuke's abilities, I feel like if we get into a fight, you'll have to do most of it."</p><p>Realizing that, Taiga felt a bit nauseous, but he could only hope that they didn't have to go for a frontal attack. After all he wasn't confident at all that he could win against any of those new Fallen, especially not Taisuke.</p><p>***</p><p>"Make sure to keep me updated, okay?" Kochi said as he handed the leaders an earpiece. "This new transmitter can't easily be seen by the enemy, yet it could get destroyed if you get a heavy impact to the head. I'll only contact the team leaders so that not all of you will get distracted, but in case I don't receive a reply I can contact those with the old wrist transmitters."</p><p>They all made sure to set the new transmitter up, but different to a normal earpiece it would automatically put itself deeper into the ear so that it couldn’t easily fall out. Taiga also got one of the new types as Kochi had one spare one and if he really needed to fight than it was better than a wrist transmitter.</p><p>"Remember that this could take days, but as soon as anything goes out of hand we will call you all back," Juri reminded them.</p><p>"Will you be okay?" Hokuto whispered next to Taiga who couldn't really nod.</p><p>"As okay as everyone else as long as we don't run into trouble and at least we both still have our chips implanted in our arms from Kochi, so in a worst case scenario our locations can always be tracked."</p><p>“Right,” Hokuto said and put his hand to the back of his neck. The Vestige microchip he had gotten from the government wasn’t a tracking device, yet it was still a dangerous weapon. For him the chip had never worked through his Fallen self, but for the other Vestige it was different. Kochi was still keeping everything they were doing a secret from the Main Center, but would they get punished if they found out?</p><p>The gates of the Center got opened and the security fence would get opened after Kochi and the others had retreated back inside, so Taiga turned back to Juri and Kochi once more. "In case something is going on here, definitely let us know, okay? We can come back at any time."</p><p>"If you worry about us or other teams you will lose your focus. We'll be fine," Juri said with a supportive smile, yet Taiga still felt anxious about them splitting up. Even almost all of them together hadn't been enough to beat Taisuke.</p><p>"I warn you, if anyone cries I'll throw up," Kentaro yelled over to them and finally Taiga was able to show a smile as well, even though it didn't last long. He walked over to Hokuto who immediately stretched out his hand to the back of his head and pulled him closer to place a kiss on his forehead.</p><p>"We'll all come back here. Just stay focused, okay?"</p><p>"You too, don't let them annoy you too much," Taiga joked looking at Jesse and Shintaro.</p><p>***</p><p>“Shouldn’t we try and find shelter for the night?”</p><p>Chaka’s question made Kentaro stop and then his look changed. “Right, you need sleep.”</p><p>“Thanks for remembering my presence,” Chaka said a bit pouting.</p><p>“Did you ever think about becoming a Vestige? A lot of your friends are Vestige too.”</p><p>Kentaro’s question made Chaka look at Matsuku who walked in front with Myuto, but then he shook his head.</p><p>“I know that as a Vestige I would be a lot stronger, but I don’t trust the Government enough and with all the stuff I heard about the microchips they implant I just never felt like doing it.”</p><p>“Might be the better choice,” Kentaro let out with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>When Chaka didn’t ask directly, but waited for Kentaro to reply, the smaller one turned and nodded. But Chaka looked quite troubled about his own question.</p><p>“I know we only met recently again after this long time and didn’t have much time to catch up, but what happened back then?”</p><p>Kentaro remained silent for a while until Myuto shouted over to them that they found a hut, but would check it out first and they should wait for them.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.”</p><p>As always Chaka was so thoughtful and Kentaro formed a brief smile. “It all started the day you went missing as well. Nika went out in the snow storm to get provisions, but when he didn’t come back until the next morning I decided to look for him, but of course I couldn’t leave my sister at home, so we went together.”</p><p>“That was when I didn’t find anyone at your house after the snow storm and went out looking for you.”</p><p>“As expected I couldn’t find Nika at the usual spots from where we got supplies so I took my sister back home and went around the neighborhood to ask if anyone had seen Nika. That was when I heard that you have gone missing since the morning.”</p><p>Chaka still felt a bit stupid for that, but he had been a child, not really thinking about any consequences.</p><p>“The air raid happened that afternoon and I tried to make it back to our house, but...I was too late.”</p><p>Another heavy silence followed, but Kentaro wasn’t the type who wanted hugs or comfort so Chaka just waited.</p><p>“I didn’t want to give up, knowing that Nika must have been out there somewhere at that time. Well, now I know that I had been closer than I thought I was, because after I couldn’t find any clues at all, I started spying around the Government buildings and of course that didn’t pass unnoticed and some soldiers tried to catch me, but I got away. Not for long though. They definitely thought I had found something out about their secret Fallen research and in the end I ended up the same. If I had known that Nika had been in the same mess...maybe I could have saved us both…”</p><p>“Or you would be with Taisuke now as well,” Chaka said, knowing that the chances for that outcome were huge.</p><p>Matsuku came back to let them know that they had found a place to stay the night so they walked up to the hut and Chaka dared to put his hand on Kentaro’s shoulder to squeeze it a bit. “You know that no matter what happens from now on, I will fight alongside you to get him back.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Can you stop looking at my food like this?” Umi scolded Reo as he sat way too close to him, while he was eating. “You don’t even need food and I won’t share with you.”</p><p>“Just because I don’t need it, doesn’t mean I don’t like it. And your food looks good,” Reo let out a bit pouting, but finally fell back against the tree next to him.</p><p>They hadn’t found any place close by to rest for the night, but Reo had made sure to use his illusions as much as possible to hide the fire place from their surroundings.</p><p>“If you were still human, you would be round and fat,” Moro scolded his friend, on which Reo kicked him against the leg.</p><p>“We won’t find that out luckily,” Reo said and stuck out his tongue towards the other one.</p><p>“It’s so hard to believe that you two are Fallen,” Umi said and bit his lip when both looked at him. “I don’t mean that in a bad way.”</p><p>Moro laughed at the sudden fear in the other one’s voice. “Be happy that Aran and Kochi got that serum, otherwise we would most likely be on Taisuke’s side now and give you an even harder time.”</p><p>“And we gave the West Center a tough time already. Kentaro and I almost killed Taiga on his first day as a Chaser.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Umi asked, more interested in that story than scared about it, because Taiga and the others were fine now and they had forgiven the Fallen for the things they did while they couldn’t actually think straight.</p><p>“Well, Hokuto was actually the one who almost killed him.”</p><p>“Right, he was half Fallen as well, if we heard that right?” Genta finally entered the conversation.</p><p>“Something like that, yes. He was supposed to become a Vestige, but the research was still shitty at that time and he ended up with a Fallen personality, which had a sadistic way of throwing Taiga and Hokuto into trouble until in the end he actually sacrificed himself to rescue Taiga.”</p><p>“Damn, that sounds so romantic,” Umi said and Genta threw a small stone at him, making the other one pout.</p><p>“Why did you decide to become a Vestige?” Moro asked and Genta sat back with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>“I wasn’t a fighter at all before I became a Vestige. I was in a research team and I had a senpai, his name was Mitsu. Things got dangerous at some point when Mitsu got part of some special research, but he wanted to get out as he didn’t agree with the Government. He also had a little brother he wanted to take care off, so when it got clear that he wouldn’t easily get out of his position he tried really hard to keep me out of that research.”</p><p>“The Fallen research,” Moro concluded.</p><p>“He made sure that I got transferred in a hurry and he wouldn’t let me know anything at all. Now I know that he did so to protect me, but I found out that he had become a Fallen through a footage I shouldn’t have had access to. I wished I knew more about his background, because I couldn’t even contact his brother about it.”</p><p>“But you are sneaky and know your way around the research Center’s backdoors,” Reo said with a lopsided smile. He liked how Genta had been so serious about finding out the truth and hadn’t been running away at that time, even though it would have been the better choice maybe.</p><p>“I knew that alone I wouldn’t be able to help him and I never wanted to see the Fallen as our enemies, because we caused their misery ourselves, so we should help them as well.”</p><p>“So you decided to become a Vestige to help him,” Moro concluded with a kind of proud look.</p><p>“And you didn’t want to become a Vestige?” Reo asked Umi who seemed troubled finding a reply.</p><p>“He tried,” Genta replied. “Right after my transition I was about to go to the North Center when I met Umi at the Main Center and he requested to become a Vestige.”</p><p>“But?” Reo asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“I have a rare health condition, which doesn’t really bother me in my daily life except if I fight for too long, but it would have been life threatening to turn me, as my cells wouldn’t have been able to make the transition.”</p><p>Umi’s explanation made sense, but it was still hard to imagine that there were indeed limits to their DNA manipulation.</p><p>“I had been traveling around the country, trying to stay out of the Capitol and I met a soldier who had been traveling as well, to help the people in more rural areas to get supplies and updates. Senga was such a great person. He was always smiling and trying to cheer everyone up. But one day I lost sight of him when we went to the Capitol and he was called to one of the military bases. It was when I met Genta that he helped me find out where he had ended up and the same as with Mitsu we found files about him. Because he had kept a low profile out of the Capitol they chose him, because they thought no one would realize it if he was suddenly gone.”</p><p>“So now you want to repay him for all the help he gave to you and the other people back then,” Moro said and Umi nodded with a nostalgic smile.</p><p>“It’s not his fault after all and with the serum we finally have a chance to actually rescue them instead of fighting them.”</p><p>“But after everything that happened I am not sure if there is a chance to rescue them,” Genta added.</p><p>“Now you sound like Taiga,” Reo said with a teasing expression.</p><p>“Better than sounding like Kentaro,” Moro added, making them all giggle a bit.</p><p>All they could do for now was trying. If Taiga hadn’t tried to convince Aran and Myuto to change, then they wouldn’t have gotten a second chance either, so they wouldn’t give up on the others without even trying.</p><p>***</p><p>“Are you sure that you don’t want to rest more?” Taiga asked a bit worried after Aran needed to be almost forced to sleep at some point, but Taiga remembered the best how tiring it could be as a human to keep up with Fallen and Vestige.</p><p>“The faster we cover our territory, the sooner we can go back,” Aran said as the sun had barely risen behind the huge mountains in the northern area. “Kochi, are you up?”</p><p>First Aran didn’t get any reply after he put his hand up to his ear, but no one was surprised that it was barely five in the morning, if even.</p><p>“Kochi is asleep, but I am in the lab. All good, why are you up so early?”</p><p>Shime and Taiga could hear Juri’s voice even like this and as expected their early departure the second day made them worry.</p><p>“All good, I just want to make sure that we are fast. How about the other teams?”</p><p>“They all rested for the night, but you are the first team we heard back from today,” Juri explained.</p><p>“Keep us updated if any team heads back before us,” Aran asked and Juri promised to inform them. They had a map and a given territory and they weren’t allowed to get out of it for safety reasons. If anything happened, the others could easily find them, knowing at least where to start the search. If they wouldn’t find anything this time, they would expand their search the next week after meeting at the West Center once more.</p><p>“You seem restless.”</p><p>Shime’s words made Taiga turn to him after he had kept scanning the mountain area. Like he did every single minute since the moment they had left the Center. So yes he was restless. Terrified was maybe the better word, but he didn’t want to make the others feel even more restless.</p><p>“Let’s go, if we are fast then we can cover enough territory today, to be able to get back tomorrow night,” Aran announced and started walking while Taiga stood still for another moment until Shime gave him a questioning look.</p><p>“Did you ever fight your own brother except for that one encounter?” Taiga asked, not even knowing why he asked such a stupid direct question, but Shime didn’t seem offended as he shook his head.</p><p>“The only time was when I met him as a Fallen for the first time and you have seen that memory. You can’t really call it a fight though. You’d be surprised though how much of a sweet and caring person he was before.”</p><p>“It’s always hard to tell the true character of a Fallen, but all I can see in Taisuke is a monster.” A few seconds passed in silence until Taiga looked up with wide eyes. “You know that I don’t mean that your brother is a monster. I am just- I don’t know…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Shime immediately soothed him and started walking so Aran wouldn’t have to wait for them. When Taiga caught up to him, he felt like he had said something more than offensive and he felt stupid for voicing out his worries towards the person who was closest to Taisuke.</p><p>“I am not hiding behind our happy memories,” Shime explained. “I want my loving brother back of course. I want him to do stupid jokes, to give me those sheepish smiles when he can’t hide a surprise and I want to be able to walk up to him, hug him and tell him welcome back.”</p><p>Shime’s words were as honest as Taigas, yet way more positive. “But I know that our chances are slim. I am not the only one who wants a family member or a friend back, but the cruel truth is that Taisuke has indeed become a monster. Of all Fallen I have ever encountered I have never seen a cruel behavior as the one of Taisuke.”</p><p>It hurt to have even Shime say those words out loud, but it made clear that he was living in reality, able to keep his emotions under control.</p><p>“But you have hope,” Taiga said with a faint smile. “I got Myuto back, now we have the serum and a lot of people who are more than willing to help out.”</p><p>Shime nodded with a thoughtful expression. After all it had been Taiga’s and Myuto’s story, which had made him put his hopes into the West Center and he couldn’t be more grateful for their help.</p><p>“We should go and help Aran, this area will be tough for him to climb,” Shime finally said after a moment of silence and when Taiga looked up he realized that they had made it to a steep area with no paths in front of them. So all they could do was climb and see what was lying between the high mountain peaks.</p>

  <b>Musen 28 - January</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two days without any living soul around,” Shintaro said, exhausted as he dropped on the dirty stone floor of the old farm house they had found in the southern area close to the ocean. Jesse had offered to get firewood and Hagi went with him, while Hokuto stood in the half broken door with a thoughtful expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He will be fine.” Shintaro hadn’t even bothered looking up at the other one or getting back up in a sitting position after he had dropped on his back, already exhausted after marching such a long distance in two days. “We will head back tomorrow and Juri said the others should also head back tomorrow or latest the day after. Myuto’s team covers the most ground in the western area so they will take a bit longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn’t reply, but it was no secret that he was worried. He wouldn’t let it show at day time as he was aware that he was the leader of the group and had to make sure everyone stayed safe, but luckily Hagi was pretty good in reading the atmosphere and he helped out as much as he could with sharing the responsibility and keep the two chaotic Chasers busy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are afraid that you can’t get to him in time if something happens,” Shintaro let out once more, but again no reaction. “They are in the North, we are in the South. The whole Capitol lies between us and they are in the mountains so even for a Vestige it will be tough to get to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Could it be that you are not trying to read what is on my mind, but speak what is on yours?” Hokuto finally let out, but didn’t turn around to the other one. When there was no reply he finally looked over his shoulder, just to find Shintaro snoring on his back. “How can you fall asleep seconds after you said something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Shintaro was indeed already deeply asleep and Hokuto only shook his head and let him be. After all they all worried for each other and all they wanted was to get back. At this point Hokuto even hoped that none of the groups would even find anyone. It wasn’t just Taiga who had felt restless about fighting Taisuke. Just the thought of one of their groups having to fight him, made Hokuto feel nauseous and he put his hand down to the metal tube on his belt. The serum was hard to produce and Kochi would need to find a reason to get to the Main Center to give him the necessary ingredients once more to make more without the Main Center getting suspicious. So for now they all had only one tube on each team. But the main problem remained, Taisuke was almost invincible alone, how were they supposed to fight against him and six other Fallen?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You heard him, right?” Aran asked after Kochi had told them that Genta’s group was heading back to the Capitol and hadn’t found any clues about Taisuke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At this point I feel it might even be safer if we all head back without finding him,” Shime said. “We didn’t have the chance to cover such a huge territory until now with just the seven of us, but except for that one time they actually showed up in the Capitol as a warning, we were never able to locate them again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like the others think the same,” Taiga said, knowing that Hokuto was definitely feeling as restless as him and Myuto definitely also wanted Aran back at the Center as soon as possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aran lifted his hand to the transmitter once more when Kochi told him that Hokuto’s team was going to turn back now as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have one more area to cover, but we will make sure to walk back through the night, so that we are back soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aran’s words had Taiga and Shime look at him scolding, but they knew that he didn’t want to delay them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Myuto’s team will also not head back before tomorrow so let’s not hurry too much. We can take breaks whenever you need to,” Shime said, but Aran already headed to the next steep path up the mountain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked in silence for a good hour until the area showed more rocks than forest and Taiga slowed down, while Shime made sure Aran was able to get over the rocky surface safely. Because he had been tense over the whole trip he had made sure to scan their surroundings as much as possible, but that was also what made him spot the difference now and he wondered if he had just spaced out in between or if this was indeed a sudden change they should worry about. Not wanting to raise panic where he might have been just a bit too exhausted he kept moving, after all even as a Fallen he would usually rest a bit more, yet he was on too high alert to sleep while Aran and Shime had done so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few meters ahead they could see a waterfall around the rocky surface and another forest ahead of them, but he stopped once more while Aran and Shime stopped at the river in front of the waterfall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taiga, this river marks the spot where we should turn around,” Aran shouted over to him, but while the other one had heard him, he didn’t reply. His eyes were fixed on the forest in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taiga?” The one in question jolted when Shime was next to him without him realizing that he had walked up to him. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you think something is off?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Shime asked, now on high alert too and he scanned the area, but couldn’t find the exact reason for Taiga’s restless state. The forests weren’t as green as their parents had seen them in their childhoods, the water from the river not necessarily drinkable and wildlife even in the most remote areas was rare, but there were still some animals left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When we met Myuto and the others before it was never outside in the woods, not for long at least. But for the past few days I kept scanning our surroundings and I reacted to every single sound, every water drop, every river, every deer and every bird I could see or hear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And?” Shime asked, still not knowing what he meant, while Aran started walking up to them as he couldn’t hear them from that distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Listen. What do you hear?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shime closed his eyes and concentrated, but then he lifted both eyebrows and looked around like Taiga did before and slowly he seemed to tense. So maybe Taiga hadn’t overreacted, but maybe he had waited too long?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” Aran asked as he had finally reached them, but when Shime reached out for the other one’s arm and gave Taiga a serious look, there was no doubt that they had to hurry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to leave, now,” Shime said and tried to sound as calm as possible, but Aran could read the atmosphere and pushed Shime a bit so that they would start moving.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga remained at the same spot for a moment longer, letting the two pass first, as they needed to get down the rocky surface once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then he heard it. He heard something and while it was just the sound of a small branch cracking on the ground, it gave him the worst shiver of his life. This had been the problem all along! Silence! Since they had made it into this area there had been nothing but silence. No birds, no deers, nothing! And Taiga regretted that he had put his fears to the back of his head for too long. Now he regretted not letting his fear take over sooner. Maybe they could have gotten away!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His own thoughts made him grind his teeth as he realized that there was no way he would give up like this. At least he had to try and get the others to safety. They weren’t here to fight, but they needed to be fast if they wanted to prevent a fight and Taiga knew that without a distraction they wouldn’t be fast enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a deep breath, which came out way more erratic than Taiga wanted it to be, he looked up and he saw how Shime had stopped and looked up to him with a scared expression. He wasn’t sure how much of the fear he was feeling was actually visible on his face, but he finally dared to turn around and find the source of the noise he had just heard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not even hiding, not even trying to be invisible as he had been until now, there he was. Taisuke, standing right at the forest, with a lopsided sneer, facing Taiga with a triumphant expression. The others were too far down to spot him, but the way Taiga didn’t dare to move, showed them that their biggest fear had come true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like in slow motion Aran put his hand up to his ear and while the transmitter connected, he didn’t speak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aran, what is it? Are you done? Aran?” Kochi’s voice sounded already worried about the lack of response, but Aran wasn’t even sure if he could still speak. The tension in the air was so thick that his throat started to rob him of air while Shime tightened his grip on his elbow, waiting for Taiga to decide what to do as he was the only one who could see what was going on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taiga, can you hear me, what is going on?” Kochi asked as he finally connected to his transmitter, but Taiga also didn’t dare to reply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no way that they could win with only three people, but Taiga was still trying to figure out if Taisuke would go after him if he ran in the opposite direction or if he would go for Shime. In the middle of his tries to figure out what to do he got disturbed by more noise and with wide eyes he realized that they were doomed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no…” Shime let out, being able to hear it as well and even without seeing them, he realized that now they were in the worst trouble ever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aran, what the hell is going on,” Juri said next after they were obviously all on high alert in the Center and debating if Juri’s team needed to head out or not. But would it even matter?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are in trouble…” Aran finally whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What kind of trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The worst…” Aran added, unable to even explain the situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> It felt like they had all stopped like this for minutes, but Taiga couldn’t move or take his eyes off all the people which had come out of the forest. Now they were a team of three, against a group of seven.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seven people who might all be as strong as Taisuke and definitely as crazy and dangerous as him. The one movement which had him finally move was when Taisuke made a step to the front. What seemed so harmless, put Taiga into a state of terror and he swirled around, jumping off the rock he was standing on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“RUN!” There was nothing more he could shout before he could hear the Fallen behind him moving and Shime swirled around and dragged Aran down the rocks. Even if he got hurt on their escape it was still better than getting killed by those Fallen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taisuke found us!” Aran was somehow able to yell into the transmitter while Shime almost carried him as he was unable to catch up with their speed. “They all found us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Capitol was finally getting into sight and Hokuto had to try hard to not speed up as Shintaro and Jesse needed more time to catch up. At some point Hokuto almost asked Kochi to send a truck to pick them up at the city borders as they didn’t have to keep a low profile inside the city.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was impatiently waiting for the remaining two teams to let them know that they were on their way back. But Myuto’s team was definitely still taking a while and Aran’s team would hopefully soon turn around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think we should go with bigger teams next time?” Hagi asked while walking up to the other one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We would get discovered easier that way,” Hokuto said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But we would also have a bigger chance of overpowering them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really think they can be overpowered?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always stood a good chance against all of us too, so I think with good teamwork it could be possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagi’s words should make Hokuto feel better, yet he could just not see how they were going to win in a head on fight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next second he heard the sound of the transmitter getting switched on, but to his surprise the wrist transmitters also got activated. Whatever the reason to contact them all wasn’t going to be good and Hokuto already tensed before Kochi spoke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All teams, we need you to head to the north immediately. Juri’s team already left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kochi tried so hard to stay calm and give information without yelling at anyone, but Hokuto already knew that in one way or the other his biggest fear had become true.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They found Aran’s team.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean they found them?” Hagi asked as Hokuto was unable to voice out any questions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no details. They were already trying to get away when Aran contacted me. It’s all of them and they appeared out of nowhere. Chances are high that they had realized already that we were looking for them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re on our way, but even if I hurry I doubt I will make it before nightfall,” Myuto was heard over the transmitter and he obviously tried to keep it together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juri’s team went with the truck, but the area they are in needs climbing so they will take at least half a day as well and they are the closest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto, what do we do?” Shintaro asked, but what were they supposed to do? They would need to go to the Center first to get a truck, which would result in them taking at least another day as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t know yet what they are up to, let’s stay in contact and hurry for now?” Hagi said and put his hand on Hokuto’s shoulder, finally making him snap out of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, we are wasting time,” Hokuto said and looked up at Shintaro and Jesse with an apologetic look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, we will follow as soon as we can, you go first. You are faster,” Jesse said and Shintaro nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hagi nodded gratefully and pushed Hokuto to the front. It was indeed better that they hadn’t been on the same team. He wasn’t functioning properly even at this distance, how would he have been of any help if he had to panic about Taiga’s safety over his own even though the other one was stronger than him. Now all he could hope for was that Taisuke was in his insane play mode once more, instead of trying to get rid of them this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aran just told me that they surrounded them,” Kochi let out a bit panicked and that was the switch needed for Hokuto to finally start running. For now all teams could just hurry and they had to believe in the others that they could maybe somehow get out of it themselves or at least survive until they made it to their area.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shime was forced to stop running when he realized that he hadn’t been fast enough and two of the Fallen showed up in front of him after they had been able to jump down most of the rocks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aran had immediately contacted Kochi, making sure he knew they were surrounded. Taiga stopped behind Aran, turning towards the Fallen approaching from the side and back. They were completely trapped, in the middle of an open rocky surface with no hiding place nearby. One side was a steep cliff, only the forest behind the Fallen giving a small hope of an escape route.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So we meet again,” Taisuke let out playfully as he stepped closer to Taiga while Shime had an eye on the Fallen on the other side, but gave his brother an annoyed look over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Little brother, you brought interesting company with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taisuke’s words made Taiga feel nauseous once more, but he needed to make sure to protect Aran at all costs or Myuto would never forgive him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taisuke, could it be that you were spying on us all this time?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course Taisuke didn’t give a direct reply, but his teasing smile showed that they had indeed known that they were out to look for them and weirdly Taiga felt relieved that they hadn’t decided to go for the Center to destroy it the same way as they did with the East Center. Maybe they were aware that all Centers were on high alert, but now they had to somehow get out of this situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see another familiar face.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those words made Taiga lift an eyebrow before he looked at Aran, but the boy didn’t seem to recognize Taisuke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aran, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you know me?” Aran asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think we let Myuto and the others do as they pleased without checking if they caused trouble or not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another slap in the face for them, because that meant they had been closer than they had thought for all this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a shame what you did to Myuto and the others. You ruined the chance to reunite Nika with his brother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Taisuke looked to the person on his left, Taiga also looked at Nika, Kentaro’s older brother. The same way as Taisuke only had one pink shimmering eye, Nika had a green shimmering one and looking at the other Fallen they also seemed to only have different eye colors in one eye.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga had seen Nika in Kentaro’s memories, yet he was of course not the same person now that he was a Fallen and he knew better than trying to reason with him now as he wouldn’t care for Kentaro as Taisuke also didn’t care for Shime. Just the fact that Nika knew that Kentaro was with Myuto and never tried to contact him showed how much Fallen didn’t care for emotional connections.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Taisuke started walking towards them, Taiga’s hand intuitively landed on the metal tube, but then he pulled back once more, knowing that it was a stupid move to use it right away. Taisuke would block the attack and destroy the tube immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you really want to fight?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are not just letting you kill us,” Taiga shot back, but then Taisuke started laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who said I was going to kill you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what, you showed yourself and stopped us, just to let us go?” Aran asked annoyed, but Taisuke’s amused expression didn’t fall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you think after you lost this badly last time that with all the Fallen present here I could kill you in an instant if I wanted to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course he could and they were painfully aware of that fact and Taiga gave Shime a troubled look, but the boy wasn’t sure either what to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How about we make a deal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As if you would keep your part of it,” Aran shot back at him, but then Taisuke pointed at him with a darker expression this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Careful boy, I have a good day, but I might reconsider my offer if you keep being impolite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what is that offer?” Shime asked as he grabbed Aran’s elbow as a warning that he needed to calm down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I let you leave, but he needs to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should be as shocked as the others, yet Taiga was way too calm when Taisuke pointed at him. After their first encounter he had feared for an outcome like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, that won’t happen,” Shime let out. “We won’t sacrifice one of our own to rescue ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who said you would sacrifice him? I promise that I won’t kill him and we won’t chase after you either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It all sounded too good to be true, yet Myuto had said it before. Fallen weren’t known to be lying. But even if he promised not to kill him there was still a lot he could do to Taiga if he decided to go with them. On the other hand…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Taiga stepped away from the other two and faced Taisuke, there was a playful yet dangerous expression on the other one’s face. “If I go with you then you have to promise to not attack the Capitol or any of the members of any Center.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh so rescuing the lives of your two friends isn’t enough?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taiga, we won’t let you go with them,” Aran interfered, but was there any other way? Taiga wanted to talk to Kochi or hear if any other group was already close, but Kochi wasn’t going to speak now as he hoped that the new transmitter still remained hidden from them. Like this Taiga still had a few tricks up his sleeve and he needed to make the others realize that him leaving with the Fallen would be to their advantage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said he won’t kill me, so don’t you think instead of all of us dying in a fight we are not prepared for, this is the better outcome?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga’s words made Aran ready to protest, but then Shime pulled him back and what seemed like an accident, was on purpose as he pressed his hand on the other one’s belt on the way. That was when Aran’s look changed as well as he realized that he tried to make him think of Taiga having the serum on his belt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t trust them. They will find a way to hurt you anyway,” Aran let out, but made sure that Taiga understood through his look that he had gotten the message.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The transmitter would tell them Taiga’s location and when all groups were gathered, they could head after them and they still had the serum so maybe Taiga could find an opening to use it. Not to forget that even if they found the transmitter he still had the implanted chip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have any reason to hurt him if he follows on his own, but I might hurt you all if you don’t hurry up,” Taisuke said, crossing his arms to his chest with an impatient look, while the Fallen around them also seemed to get a bit restless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remember that he loves games, be careful what you say,” Shime warned Taiga and gave him the indirect okay to go with Taisuke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great, so if you don’t mind I don’t like standing around for nothing,” Taisuke said and made a hand movement for Taiga to get over to him, while the other Fallen retreated. Just one of them actually walked up to Taisuke, making them all tense once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still unsure if this was going to be the worst decision of his life or not, Taiga finally dared to step away from his friends and while he tried to keep some distance from Taisuke, he didn’t dare to step away when Taisuke came way too close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So then let’s make sure that your friends are really leaving, shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>First Taiga didn’t understand what he meant until he reached out for Taiga’s face. He tried to pull away this time, but when Taisuke grabbed his arm and gave him a warning look it was clear that he would still kill them all if necessary. After a few seconds he pulled back with a lopsided smile before he left Taiga next to the other Fallen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yokoo, have a look at him for a moment.” The Fallen with one orange eye nodded, but for now Taiga didn’t dare to move anyway as Taisuke approached Aran and Shime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I usually never give second chances, but if you want to join me after all then here is your chance,” Taisuke offered his little brother, but Shime shook his head. After all, Taiga going with them was dangerous enough. “Fine, then it’s your turn now to get back to your Center. And don’t worry I will make sure to take good care of your friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aran intuitively pulled back when Taisuke wanted to stretch his hands out to his face, but Shime gave him a warning look. Taisuke wasn’t known for his patience, but they had no choice but to trust his words. One stupid move could turn the whole group against them and as much as they all would love to fight, they knew that they had no chance against them all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga tensed when Taisuke used his mind control on Aran while Shime was immune against all his copied abilities, but it was still a smart move to control Aran so that Shime would be forced to follow him if he wanted to make sure that he was going to be okay. “Make sure to tell them how nice it was of me to let you go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taisuke turned to Taiga with a mocking smile before he snapped his fingers and Aran turned around without another word and left towards the forest, Shime giving Taiga another worried look before he followed him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you try to attack us then maybe I can’t keep my part of the deal either,” Taisuke gave as a last warning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So much unused potential, indeed,” Taisuke let out as he opened and closed his own hand, feeling how Taiga’s ability was gone once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if not even realizing what danger Taiga had brought over himself he finally spent the Fallen around him more attention. Different from Myuto's group, they seemed more like subordinates than individual group members. None of them talking or moving if not asked to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay so first things first,” Taisuke said as he stopped in front of Taiga and held his hand out. Taiga could only give him a questioning look as he didn’t understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh come on, think for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taisuke’s patience was indeed not his strongest point and Taiga hurried to look for what he could mean and then he sighed. Of course, what else?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t really think we would let you keep those things?” Taisuke asked amused when Taiga took his bracelet off and handed it to Taisuke, followed by his two hilts. Luckily the only one with an Ex2 suit had been Aran and they didn’t seem to have realized the new technology. The older one handed the weapons to Yokoo, but he still turned back to Taiga once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t play with my patience.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What patience was what Taiga wanted to ask, but he refrained from saying it out loud and reached out for his boots, pulling out the knife he always hid there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those are all the weapons I have,” Taiga announced when Taisuke still didn’t seem satisfied. With a swift movement Taisuke reached out for Taiga’s belt and the metal tube was in his hand before Taiga could react.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure this one is not a weapon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was he allowed to lie? Wouldn’t they find out anyway? For now Taisuke threw the tube towards a violet eyed Fallen. “Miyata, make sure to do research on this and Mitsu can help you. I doubt our tough boy will spill answers easily.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And here Taisuke could just use his own ability against him and find every single secret out through mind reading, but Taisuke seemed to like games way more than the direct and boring way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, then we’re almost ready to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once more Taisuke held out his hand, but this time Taiga didn’t react at all. He had given all his weapons and was even stripped of his only secret weapon. When Taisuke pulled him closer and leant over his shoulder Taiga wanted to push him away, but once more he forced his body to stay still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You worked really hard in making such a good transmitter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His words gave Taiga a shiver as he realized that their plan was good for nothing now that Taisuke had realized about the transmitter. But for now they had a plan B. “If you have anything to say then do it now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course they had listened in silence, but then Taiga could hear the sound of the transmitter connecting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we promise to not go after you again, will you give him back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As always Kochi was good in making sure to choose his words wisely, yet Taisuke giggled next to Taiga’s ear and his grip on his arm became even tighter when he spoke again, his lips brushing over the other one’ earlobe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There won’t be any peace between us, but don’t worry I will give him back to you at some point as long as you don’t come to get him back by yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you don’t stand by your word then we will come for you,” Kochi threatened, knowing that they had to make clear as well that they weren’t going to sit back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you will be busy fighting another fight before you can think about an attack.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kochi wanted to say something about that weird threat, yet Taisuke took out the transmitter and stepped on it before there was any reply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean with another fight?” Taiga asked instead, but now Taisuke’s expression showed more excitement once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will see soon enough,” Taisuke promised before he waved at the blue eyed Fallen who stepped next to Taiga. “Senga will use his special ability on you. I advise you to not move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is your ability?” Taiga asked and made a step back before Senga could reach out for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It won’t hurt as long as you don’t struggle,” Senga let out in a cold voice when he reached out for Taiga’s face. There was absolutely no way Taiga could win even if he tried to put up a fight, so why waste his energy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Senga put his hand on his face and first he thought that he also possessed some kind of mind control, but he pulled back after a short time without anything obvious happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did you do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t you feel it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Senga’s words made Taiga concentrate on his own body and abilities, just to realize a familiar feeling. Something he had experienced when Moro used his ability on him. “You took away my abilities.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More or less. They are blocked. All of them. Even your special ones and they won’t return for the next 24 hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A smart move, yet Taiga wished he could tell the others about their special abilities. Senga’s might only work once a day as it was a strong ability and definitely needed a long recharge time, but a whole day without abilities was a huge disadvantage. He was nothing more than a Chaser without weapons now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Senga will keep taking your abilities away each day for the time being. We don’t want any accidents, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga turned to Taisuke, but before he could say anything there was a sharp pain in his neck and with a hiss he jumped to the side. With Senga’s ability he couldn’t sense his surroundings that well anymore and in shock he realized that the pain had come from an injection the red eyed Fallen had carried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the hell was that for?” Taiga yelled, but his voice sounded more scared than angry. It was more than clear by now that they had known about them approaching this area for the entire time or they wouldn’t have been this prepared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Too many questions. You won’t die ok? There is one more thing we have to change before you are allowed to come with us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Allowed, right,” Taiga let out a bit of mocking on the other one’s words, but once more he just waited when Yokoo reached out for him this time. When the other one put his hand over his eyes though he tensed, but this time it took only a second for the other one to step back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Taiga opened his eyes once more he gasped and reached out for his own face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will stay blind for about an hour,” Yokoo explained. “I can also take the blindness away sooner, but for now you are not allowed to see where we are going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One smart move after the other and now it was to no one's surprise anymore that they had been able to hide for such a long time. Whatever they had injected him with didn’t seem to show any active reaction yet, but Taiga already had a guess and if he was right then they were now completely unable to track Taiga.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shall we then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Taisuke’s voice was right next to his ear again, Taiga flinched, making the other one chuckle before he hooked his arm with his and started walking. “We don’t want you to get hurt, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right, because Taisuke himself would take care of all the hurting, that was for sure...</span>

  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>It was a miracle that the gates of the Center didn’t break when Hokuto cursed and pushed them open when the automatic system took too long. “Why are they even closed?” Hokuto hissed while Hagi hurried after him towards the lab where Hokuto stormed inside.</p><p>“Kochi, where are the trucks? Why is no one getting ready?” Hokuto yelled as he stopped in the middle of the door, but when he saw Genta’s team in the lab as well he became even angrier.</p><p>“Why the hell are you still here? Do you think Juri’s team can handle all seven of them by themselves?”</p><p>“Hokuto, calm down,” Kochi said as he got up, but it had been the wrong thing to say as Hokuto walked up to him with threatening steps.</p><p>“I will be calm when they are all back here in the Center and when that psychopath is dead.”</p><p>Luckily Shime’s friends didn’t really get angry on the way Hokuto didn’t seem to care for Taisuke, but at the moment no one could blame him for his harsh words.</p><p>“They will be back soon,” Umi explained and for a split second Hokuto’s anger was replaced by relief, but then he shook his head. There was no way Taisuke would have shown up like that just to let them go. Everyone’s faces also showed a troubled expression so this wasn’t the whole story.</p><p>“What happened?” Hokuto finally asked directly and Kochi felt more than troubled about where to start and how to explain things. “Kochi, I give you one chance to directly tell me what is going on or I will use my mind reading. I will hunt them down myself if you won’t help me.”</p><p>“Then Taiga will die,” Kochi let out without any outrights and it was the worst Kochi could have said as Hokuto’s worst fear had just become reality.</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>“Taisuke told them that if Taiga stayed with them the other two could leave and there would be a truce between us as long as we don’t try to go after them. They promised to not kill Taiga and let him go at some point. Juri and the others are picking up Aran and Shime. I heard through the transmitter that Taisuke stole Taiga’s mind control to force Aran to leave so that Shime had to follow him to watch out that he was okay. Unfortunately he also took away Taiga’s weapons, the serum and destroyed the transmitter. So we can’t do anything but wait for now.”</p><p>There was a long and heavy silence in the room until Hokuto had progressed what Kochi had just explained. But the snort he let out made clear that he wasn’t going to accept this explanation. With the next step he took Kochi by the collar, but Moro, Reo and Hagi stayed back for now.</p><p>“And you thought letting him sacrifice himself was a good idea? Do you even know what Taisuke can do to him?”</p><p>“Yes Hokuto, we all know that Taiga is in huge danger, but what were we supposed to do?”</p><p>“Wait for us, like it was planned! Damn it, Kochi, you came up with this whole plan in the first place! Juri was on his way, Genta’s group would have been close too and we could have left now too!”</p><p>Hokuto started yelling again, but this time Kochi had enough and grabbed the other one’s hands, making him let go of his collar. “Taiga had decided to stay behind so the others could get away.”</p><p>“Taiga always does reckless things! Why would you let him do this?” Hokuto’s angry shouting made it difficult for Kochi to find a calm reply and this time his eyes narrowed and he got angry too.</p><p>“For god’s sake Hokuto! I know that you are worried for Taiga, but would you think just for a second? You lost against Taisuke with four people, how were they supposed to fight seven of them with three people?”</p><p>“They are a strong group. They could have held them off until we came.”</p><p>“No, Hokuto they could have not.”</p><p>“We could have thought about another way,” Hokuto shouted, but then Kochi finally had enough.</p><p>“THEY WOULD ALL BE DEAD NOW!” Kochi’s outraged shouting had everyone including Hokuto fall silent. “Don’t you think I considered all possibilities? I wanted another way too, but damn we can already be happy that Taisuke didn’t just ambush and slaughter them on the spot. Don’t you think Taiga was afraid of what could happen to him if he agreed? But he went with them so that the others could live and we get another chance to make a new plan and face them once more.”</p><p>Hokuto took a few steps back, his look now empty and absentminded on the floor. “I am afraid of what they can do to him.”</p><p>Hokuto had whispered the words, but they all shared the same fear. Taiga had only told Hokuto about his fears before, but the way Taisuke had already found an interest in the way Taiga was a Fallen, yet so different from them, made him fear for the worst.</p><p>“So are we,” Kochi said finally in a calmer voice again before he walked up to Hokuto and put his hand on his shoulder. “But Taiga knew that they had no chance. He didn’t want the others to get as badly hurt as you all got before. Just one try to attack them, would have maybe cost all their lives. Now all we can do is trust Taiga’s strength and wait for him to come back.”</p><p>Hokuto understood that of course, but he couldn’t shake his anger off that easily. He was angry at Taisuke for that ambush, the way he had obviously aimed for Taiga from the very beginning. Then there was that stupid anger about Shime and Aran not stopping him, even though he understood that they also knew that Taiga wouldn’t let them fight and risk their lives. His biggest anger was directed at Taiga for risking his life for everyone else.</p><p>“What about the chip?” Hokuto asked as he finally calmed down able to think straight, but Kochi shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know what they did or how they found it, but the signal died a few minutes after they broke the transmitter.”</p><p>“I swear I will fight my way through every single Fallen in this country if they don’t return him in one piece,” Hokuto hissed and turned around, leaving the lab without another word.</p><p>Hagi gave Kochi a worried look, but the other one shook his head. “Give him some space. If you follow him now then you will just get caught up in his outburst and it's better for him to destroy the training room instead of hurting one of us through his anger.”</p><p>It was clear that Hokuto needed to calm down first and it would take some time, but his anger would give him strength as well and eventually he would be the one ready to rip Taisuke apart if necessary.</p><p>***</p><p>This time Taiga didn’t flinch when Yokoo put his hand back over his eyes and he felt more than relieved to be able to see again. The place they were at seemed more of a bunker than a real building, the room they were at showing a half round ceiling and raw stone walls with only one visible metal door at the other side of the room. To his surprise the other Fallen hadn’t come with them, which meant there were more rooms to their hideout or they were guarding around the area.</p><p>“Thank you Yokoo,” Taisuke said and the Fallen left the room. The door wasn’t locked as it seemed, but they could lock it from the inside, so it was more for them to keep intruders out than to try and keep Taiga in. He also had gone down a ladder to reach the bunker in the first place so he was pretty sure that they were underground.</p><p>“I guess you realized already that even if you tried to get away it wouldn’t work. This hideout is under a mountain. Even if you somehow make it past all the others, you will be completely lost outside and we will find you before you can get away.”</p><p>Meant as much as if you try to run, we will find and kill you, but Taiga wasn’t stupid. They had promised to eventually let him go. Even though it wasn’t clear when exactly that would be and why they took him with them in the first place, Taiga didn’t want to ask too many questions for now.</p><p>“So Taiga, how about you tell me a bit about the parts I didn’t get to know about yet?” Taisuke asked as he sat down on a wooden chair next to a desk, which seemed to have some research papers on it and when Taiga looked around the room a bit more he realized that they obviously did similar research in here than Aran did back at their hideout.</p><p>“What do you want to know?” Taiga asked as he kept standing in the middle of the room as he didn’t see any place he could sit close to Taisuke and the other one hadn’t offered him to sit in the first place.</p><p>“Tell me about how you’ve become a Fallen.” It wasn’t a weird question and even if Taiga refused to reply, Taisuke could easily read his mind the next time his abilities came back to find every detail he didn’t get the first time when he had read his mind.</p><p>“It was an accident,” Taiga started and Taisuke leant to the front, resting his elbows on the desk with an intense look. “Aran had created a Transfer serum to split Hokuto’s Fallen and Vestige self and the Vestige abilities were meant to be transferred to me, yet it were the Fallen abilities which I got.”</p><p>“Mh, I should invite Aran over at some point too. He could help Miyata and Mitsu with their research a lot.” Taisuke said in amusement, not that Taiga saw himself as an invited guest. “Then the serum you had with you was something Aran created as well?”</p><p>This time Taiga remained silent, but when Taisuke snapped his fingers to get his attention he looked up again. “You know that I can get all the information I need whenever you think that keeping secrets will somehow help you.”</p><p>“It’s the serum with which we helped Myuto and the others to get back in control of their emotions.”</p><p>“Oh?” Taisuke said as he leant back with a smile. “And you thought you could use it against us so that we will turn back into the nice little humans you want us to be?”</p><p>“The only thing that will change is your access to human emotions. You will keep your Fallen abilities.”</p><p>“Why would we want to deal with stupid emotions?”</p><p>“Myuto asked the same until I showed him why,” Taiga replied, hoping he could somehow make Taisuke get interested in seeing what Myuto had seen as well, but unfortunately Taisuke didn’t seem to be interested.</p><p>“Nice try, but I won’t give you your abilities back that would be too dangerous. There is so much potential in your abilities, which you didn’t even realize until now.”</p><p>“So of what use am I to you without my abilities? Why did you bring me here?” Taiga finally asked.</p><p>This time Taisuke got up and approached Taiga with an entertained expression as he put his hand with a light touch on the other one’s face, which made Taiga tense, but he didn’t move. “I will teach you how to use your full potential.”</p><p>Taiga wanted to laugh on that stupid statement, but he knew better than to make Taisuke angry. “How will you do that without me even having my abilities?”</p><p>“Don’t be so impatient,” Taisuke said as he pulled back and told him to follow as he walked up to the door. They entered a long corridor with a few doors, but Taisuke headed to a circular staircase, which lead down to another room. This one was even bigger than their lab.</p><p>“You will train here,” Taisuke explained. There was nothing in this room at all, except for a few lights on the ceiling and Taiga wondered how far down in the mountains they were.</p><p>“With you?” Taiga asked, still wondering why Taisuke even offered something like this.</p><p>“With all of us. First I will test your human strength. You were a Chaser before, right? When I have the feeling you are obedient enough to keep going I will give your abilities back for the training, but maybe you won’t even need them anymore by then.”</p><p>“And then what?” This time Taiga had sounded snappier than he wanted to, but he just couldn’t make sense out of the situation. As if he could stand a chance against them without his abilities, no training in the world could help Chasers become that strong, even for Aran this would be an almost impossible challenge.</p><p>“You will see that soon enough,” Taisuke let out, but he didn’t make a move to get back upstairs and walked up to the middle of the room instead with an inviting hand movement. “How about you show me what you can do?”</p><p>After he had lost as a Fallen against him already, how was he supposed to stand a chance against him as a human?</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t get angry even if you land a hit, but don’t think I will go easy on you.”</p><p>This time Taiga couldn’t hold back a disbelieving laugh, but Taisuke seemed more amused by it than annoyed.</p><p>“Fine, but let me remind you that I can’t train if I am hurt,” Taiga said with the broad hint that if Taisuke went overboard he needed to give Taiga his abilities back so that he could heal.</p><p>“If I need to get that serious with you without your abilities then you will be the first human to impress me.”</p><p>“Then wait until you give me my abilities back,” Taiga challenged, not even knowing how he could speak with this confidence after he had lost this badly once already and was so scared of this outcome in the first place, but maybe keeping Taisuke entertained for as long as possible was his best shot for now.</p><p>***</p><p>Nightfall had come before Myuto’s group was able to make it back, but Kochi had told them about the situation and as Aran was safe, Myuto was easier convinced to take it slower on their way back now that there was no hurry.</p><p>Inside the Center the air was so full of tension that everyone had retreated to their own spaces to not have another fight with Hokuto who was still in the training room, unable to calm down. He had succeeded in not destroying anything, except for some training equipment, but no matter what he did, the anger stayed with him.</p><p>When the early morning hours had already arrived and the Center had fallen quiet, Hokuto could hear the Main Gate open, but he didn’t want to go as he could sense who had entered. It wasn’t their fault, yet he feared that he would yell at Shime and Aran. A few minutes later he could hear Noel and Shizu talking to Shime in the corridor, but to his surprise it was Aran he saw first. Juri hurried after Aran as the boy entered the training room, making Hokuto’s look darken.</p><p>“I don’t want to talk to-” Hokuto started, but then he fell silent when Aran stopped right in front of him, sank to his knees and bowed so deeply that his forehead touched the floor. Juri stopped at the door, biting his lip and Shime only watched through the glass wall, obviously not daring to get in.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I know as the group leader I should have come up with a plan. No matter what, I should have found a way to get us all out of the situation, but I couldn’t. I swear if it had been possible I would have gladly switched places with Taiga. I know you won’t be able to forgive me, but I just want you to know that I feel like a coward and traitor. Whatever it takes to ensure that he can return safely I will make sure to do it!”</p><p>There was nothing Hokuto could reply. It wasn’t like he had seen this coming, but it also didn’t take away his anger, not that he thought that Shime or Aran were to blame for it in the first place, but his anger was still too fresh to just accept his apology and act like everything was okay.</p><p>After Aran didn’t move from his position, Shime also finally dared to step into the room, next to Juri, but before he could say anything, Hokuto had enough.</p><p>“I don’t need you to apologize,” Hokuto let out, but his voice sounded anything, but soothing. When Aran finally sat up, Hokuto’s look towards him could even be called threatening. “Taiga is stubborn and he did what he always does to protect everyone else. And now all we can do for him is to wait and not interfere, right?”</p><p>Unfortunately that was indeed the truth so Aran bit his lip with a defeated expression, but that made Hokuto even angrier.</p><p>“You know what, if you really feel sorry and want to make up for it then get your ass up and you too!” When Hokuto pointed at Shime, the boy in question pointed at himself with a questioning expression. “Do you think sitting around here doing nothing will help anyone? If we want to kick their asses the moment they show up again, we need to do it right, so get over here and I will teach you how you fight assholes like him.”</p><p>Now Hokuto’s intentions were clear and Juri couldn’t hide a small smile on Hokuto’s outburst, which ended up with him forcing the others to train with him, which could end up with them getting hurt, but it was indeed better than just sitting around and feeling guilty.</p><p>“Don’t worry I will make sure that the others join your training from tomorrow so that he can release his anger with others too,” Juri promised.</p><p>“Who said you are allowed to leave?” Hokuto said and Juri looked at him dumbfounded. “We have more people than them, but they are stronger. So we need way better teamwork than we had until now. That includes you!”</p><p>“I need to report to Kochi,” Juri tried to explain, but Hokuto didn’t seem in the mood for excuses. “Fine, then bring him and everyone you see on the way right here to train with us. The sooner we start the better.”</p><p>Juri sighed and rubbed his temples before Shime patted his shoulder with a brief smile. “Better he gets his bad mood under control now than later, right?”</p><p>“Try not to get hurt and I will see if I can get Kochi to somehow make him rest,” Juri promised while Aran felt down enough to not even question Hokuto’s idea of training through the night. Maybe it was even better for Aran to distract himself as well. And Hokuto had a good point, they would all be angry enough to go for a head on fight the moment they returned Taiga to them. So they should make sure to give them the hardest fight of their lives!</p><p>***</p><p>It wasn’t like stripping Taiga of his abilities would make him more vulnerable against their attacks, but without even knowing how much time had passed as there was no daylight inside the bunker, there was a limit to how much Taiga could train. Not that it could be called training anymore by now, more a challenge for them who could defeat Taiga the fastest.</p><p>“Can I remind you that you are seven people and can take breaks, but I cannot?” Taiga said towards Taisuke who sat on the metal staircase, watching him running away from Mitsu for a few minutes already.</p><p>“Your thinking is too much of a human. You don’t have such low limits,” Taisuke said, but Taiga could only roll his eyes. Taisuke had given him a tough fight right at the start already and then he had started calling the others to fight him one by one. Miyata and Tama were the only two without any special ability, but they were still strong and it wasn’t like Taiga could even win any fight. Taisuke would just randomly stop the fight at some point, no matter if Taiga was still able to go on or if he was already defeated on the ground.</p><p>“At least let me heal in between,” Taiga complained, but again Taisuke shook his head.</p><p>“As I said, you are capable of way more. You just have to realize that.”</p><p>Before Taiga could give a snappy reply, Mitsu had shown up right in front of him and another shockwave crushed him with his back into the wall. Leaving him on the ground, coughing.</p><p>“How am I supposed to even concentrate on any limits like this?” Taiga hissed, but Taisuke seemed disappointed in his ongoing complaining.</p><p>“You keep asking stupid questions. Throw that stupid emotional talk away, maybe then you can concentrate on what is important.”</p><p>Mitsu made his way over to Taiga once more, but the boy jumped up and got ready to at least try and counter, but then Mitsu snapped his fingers and Taiga cursed. Once more his movements had been stopped. Mitsu could freeze his movements for several seconds, long enough to kill him in a real battle. But he had only used his ability once so far. Which meant he needed some minutes to be able to use it again, maybe his recharge time also depended on how long he stopped someone’s movements.</p><p>“You do realize that I could have killed you a dozen times already, right? I don’t even need to stop your movements for that.”</p><p>“Do you all have a thing for games or why the hell don’t you just kill ahead when you are all so invincible? At the East Center you slaughtered everyone without hesitation.”</p><p>After he had stayed this calm for as long as possible, Taiga had finally lost the battle and his patience had run out. Mitsu stepped back when the paralysis of Taiga’s body finally faded, but this time Taisuke walked up to him with a dark expression, but the wall stopped Taiga from retreating.</p><p>What he hadn’t seen coming was Taisuke grabbing him by the neck and slamming him into the wall. “You prefer if I go ahead and kill you? Then we will head to the West Center, kill off your friends one by one and then we keep going until the whole Capitol and their useless humans are all dead.”</p><p>”You promised to not kill me,” Taiga let out between trying to loosen the other one’s grip, but in response Taisuke pulled him away from the wall and lifted him up this time, so that he struggled for air even more, kicking the air.</p><p>“Who would care if I kill all the people you know?”</p><p>There was not even a doubt that Taisuke was serious. A Fallen wasn’t easy to argue with and if Taisuke decided to change his plans then he would go for it, but this time anger rose inside of Taiga. He had been able to bring back Myuto and the others and for Shime’s and Kentaro’s sake he was still willing to try and reason with them, but maybe Taisuke was right. The human way wouldn’t work with them.</p><p>Taisuke had definitely not seen that Taiga would fight back and he was forced to step back when Taiga lifted his knee and even though he had barely scratched Taisuke, it had been enough to make the other one drop him and hold his hand to his chin. “Oh, so I think someone is finally learning.”</p><p>“If you teach me too well I might learn how to defeat you,” Taiga growled and once more an amused expression showed on the older one’s face.</p><p>“Then let’s see how much I need to corner you to actually make that happen.”</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>“He has been on it since last night,” Kochi explained after Myuto and Kentaro had finally made it back and where now in front of the training room. Inside they found Hokuto, Aran and Shime exactly where they had been since last night.</p><p>When Aran got taken off his feet after Hokuto had sent him flying, Myuto made sure to stop Aran from getting back into their training fight.</p><p>“You are going to take a break and I mean an eight hour sleeping break at least,” Myuto warned the other one as he wanted to dash to the front once more.</p><p>“Did you just come back?” Aran greeted him and Myuto didn’t miss the lack of reaction. He should be happy to see him, realizing that Myuto had been worried for him as well, yet he was obviously still feeling too restless and guilty to even consider it.</p><p>“I can rest later,” Aran added and wanted to turn around, but this time Kentaro walked up to him and pushed him out of the way.</p><p>“If Hokuto needs someone to train with then leave that to me. I am angry enough for both of us.”</p><p>“You are always angry,” Hokuto said, but turned towards the other one, accepting his offer to train.</p><p>Shime sneaked away the moment he got a chance and Kochi made sure that he got some rest too and told him to meet with Chaka and Matsuku who were in the lab.</p><p>“Why don’t you update me on the situation instead?” Myuto asked Aran while Kentaro had already ignored them and gave Hokuto the anger outlet he had been waiting for. No one should get into their way now that they were not just training, but fighting for real and Kochi hurried to pull Myuto and Aran out of the training room and into the corridor.</p><p>“Don’t get in there for now, okay? I will make sure that Reo or one of the Fallen will take care of Hokuto’s anger if he doesn’t finally collapse after this.”</p><p>The next moment Kentaro crashed into the glass wall, but took a run up at Hokuto right away, leaving Kochi shaking his head. “Well I don’t think he will run out of energy soon. And I don’t want to see you two around here until tomorrow.”</p><p>Myuto got the hint and pushed Aran towards their living quarters and the boy was already tired enough to not complain, yet his silence also worried Myuto.</p><p>“You know that you can also talk to me instead of trying to get your emotions under control in a suicide training with Hokuto. We are all worried after all.”</p><p>“I wish I could stop overthinking the whole situation,” Aran let out as he dropped on a chair, while Myuto leant against the closed door. “I know that even with all of us it would have been more than a tough challenge to beat them or even run from them, but I keep thinking what if I hadn’t gone with them? What if Hokuto would have been on that team or you?”</p><p>“Then we would have most likely started a fight with Taisuke and they would have killed us and taken Taiga by force.”</p><p>That was a truth Aran couldn’t deny, yet he still sighed and looked even more troubled.</p><p>“Taisuke was interested in Taiga’s Fallen abilities right from the start. It was our mistake to not consider this outcome and keep Taiga in the Center. But then the Center would have maybe been attacked while the others were out. So I would say we even got the best outcome for now and you know too that Taiga will scold you if you keep judging yourself like this. You did a great job out there and staying calm was the best you could have done.”</p><p>“Then why can’t I calm down now?” Aran asked and Myuto finally walked up to him and took his hands, which were slightly shaking before he guided Aran to the bed.</p><p>“I can help you with that and to be honest I think you definitely need my help.”</p><p>Myuto sat next to the other one and patiently waited for his reply and finally Aran nodded. “I guess I won’t be of any use if I keep exhausting myself instead of actually helping out.”</p><p>“That thinking is exactly why we need you back to full strength. Without you, Kochi needs to manage everyone by himself, don’t do that to him.”</p><p>Finally a brief almost invisible smile showed up on the other one’s face before he turned his face to Myuto. “Just don’t let me sleep for too long, okay?”</p><p>Myuto reached out for the other one’s cheek and leant to the front, placing a kiss on his forehead before he had to put his other hand to Aran’s back to slowly drop him on the bed after he had used his mind control to force Aran to fall asleep. “Just as long as you need for now.”</p><p>***</p><p>The only Fallen Taiga hadn’t fought yet stepped into the room and his look reminded him a lot of Kentaro, which wasn’t surprising as they were siblings after all.</p><p>The only reason Taiga knew that more than a day had passed was when Senga had used his ability on him once more to make sure that he stayed without his abilities for longer.</p><p>“This is going to be interesting,” Taisuke let out while he moved forth and back between the staircase and the wall.</p><p>“Am I finally getting a break after this?” Taiga asked, because no matter if Fallen or not, he was more than exhausted.</p><p>“Stop asking such a human question and I might consider it,” Taisuke mocked and Taiga rolled his eyes before he faced Nika. After Taisuke had freaked out on him before, Taiga had made sure to fight as seriously as he could and while he felt like they were holding back in the first place so that Taisuke could analyze Taiga’s fighting, he didn’t feel as exhausted as he would normally do.</p><p>“This will be over quickly anyway,” Nika said in a husky voice as he stepped closer.</p><p>“You are so damn much alike,” Taiga said, yet Nika didn’t even react before he dashed to the front, almost with the same speed Taisuke used.</p><p>Until now he had realized that Taisuke was indeed the fastest out of them. From their physical strength Senga and obviously Nika were maybe a bit stronger than Taisuke and Nika’s ability just showed Taiga that he needed a plan and that fast, because the moment Nika had reached out for his arm, Taiga found himself on his knees, screaming in pain.</p><p>Pain infliction had always been Myuto’s most dangerous ability and Nika seemed to be able to use this ability in an even stronger way.</p><p>Luckily Taiga had trained with Myuto long enough to be able to get a grip for the short time he needed to drop to the back and kick up, making Nika back off.</p><p>“No wonder you waited with him until the last fight. After this I don’t need a break as I will be unconscious anyway,” Taiga mocked and Taisuke seemed amused enough to clap his hands.</p><p>“Or you finally realize your potential,” Taisuke challenged and the next second Nika went in for another attack. Taiga tried to somehow keep him on distance, but what was he supposed to do? Even as a Chaser he still had his suit, Dragnacit blades and crickets to defend himself, now he had nothing.</p><p>When Nika got a grip on him this time, he didn’t use his ability and just made him crash into the next wall with a shockwave, leaving him coughing on the ground next to Taisuke. The older one crouched down next to him and stroked his fingers gently over his hair. “Do you remember what I said to your friends?”</p><p>Taiga went back up on his elbows and gave him an annoyed look as Taisuke didn’t immediately continue.</p><p>“I said I wouldn’t kill you.”</p><p>And they could all just hope that he stood to his word, but something on his face showed Taiga that they had maybe miscalculated.</p><p>“And I won’t kill you, but he might.”</p><p>The realization about that made Taiga want to punch Taisuke straight in the face, but it had been their own carelessness to not calculate Taisuke’s games.</p><p>Taiga jumped up when Nika dashed over to him and this time the other one seemed to be done with playing around and he trapped him in the next corner. Unable to even think about a defense move Nika had reached out for his neck and used his pain infliction, not letting Taiga slide to the ground even though he wouldn’t be able to stand on his own anymore if Nika wasn’t holding him up forcefully against the wall.</p><p>“There is a small difference to Myuto’s pain infliction,” Taisuke said in a way too calm voice. “From his pain infliction you will usually only black out. Nika’s ability will kill you the moment you lose consciousness.”</p><p>“Great,” Taiga hissed between heavy breaths, trying to suppress another scream, but Nika suddenly pulled him away from the wall and slammed him into the ground. Once more Taiga tried to remember any tricks he had learned which could help him, but Nika sat on top of him, making it impossible for him to twist away.</p><p>With the next wave of pain he could feel the difference Taisuke was talking about. Nika’s ability seemed more like a combination of Myuto’s and Kentaro’s and it scared Taiga, knowing that without his own abilities he wouldn’t be able to win, maybe even not survive if Taisuke wouldn’t stop Nika.</p><p>“Afraid? Such a stupid human emotion,” Taisuke said next to him, flashing him another insane smile.</p><p>Fear...the one emotion Fallen felt! It had been that one emotion keeping the others from accepting feelings and other emotions in the first place. But Taisuke and the others could still not accept that. Taiga on the other hand knew how much fear could strengthen a Fallen.</p><p>Exactly this fear made Taiga try and struggle even more while he couldn’t hold back another scream, but then his fear changed. For a split second when he closed his eyes he felt like getting a breaking headache and then he saw something, so vague and short that he couldn’t even tell what had happened. But one thing he was sure of, it had been Hokuto’s face which had shown up or more like a feeling that it had been Hokuto. There hadn’t been any clear picture, more like an emotional connection and he could feel so much raw mental pain, so much fear from the other one and then his own fear changed to something he had never felt before.</p><p>As if struck by lightning, Taiga jolted and almost lost the ability to breathe before he realized that the pain was gone, but that realization seemed to confuse Nika as he was still using his ability. But Taiga wasn’t afraid anymore of the other one’s ability, he wasn’t afraid of anything.</p><p>Without even knowing how he was able to show such confidence he moved his hand up and the next moment Nika was thrown to the back. The impact hadn’t been hard enough to hurt him, but he still needed a moment to find his balance.</p><p>As if a weird kind of tension was overflowing within Taiga he jumped up and even his speed was back. He could still not feel his special abilities, but he was feeling stronger, already starting to heal from the wounds and exhaustion the others had caused him. Yet what he felt the most was the urge to rip Nika into pieces. He couldn’t calm down enough though to even realize what was going on and this time he actually managed to have an almost even fight with Nika, not giving the other one any opportunities to use his special ability.</p><p>Taisuke kept watching for a while until Nika was forced to jump back towards him. Taiga got ready to attack him once more, but then Taisuke stepped in between them. But even that move didn’t stop Taiga and he lunged out, this time a normal punch though and Taisuke stopped it in his palm.</p><p>“Oh? I didn’t expect you to attack me. I guess you are stronger than I thought.”</p><p>“What do you mean? What the hell did you do to me?” Taiga hissed at him, but different from Nika, he didn’t feel the urge to immediately fight Taisuke and slowly he calmed down again, stepping back when his clouded mind cleared up a bit. With a groan he put his hands to his head and he stumbled to the back.</p><p>“I didn’t do anything, well, maybe only encouraging you to finally find your full potential and you just did.”</p><p>“I broke through Senga’s ability?”</p><p>“Do you think so?”</p><p>No he actually didn’t, but what was it then? His special abilities were still blocked and his movements had been strong, yet different from usual. Maybe he had indeed almost broken through Senga’s ability, but whatever it was he was still not completely in control of it. Also what was this connection he had felt earlier with Hokuto? Had this been part of Taisuke’s intention too or should he keep it a secret?</p><p>Before he could keep over-thinking he fell to his knees with heavy breaths and Taisuke crouched down in front of him. “You will need some time to recover now and we can still have a detailed talk later, but you know what your hidden potential was?”</p><p>Almost unable to keep conscious, Taiga looked up at the older one who formed a proud smile as if he had taught him a special secret move no one else knew about. “What you just awoke in yourself is the survival of the fittest!”</p><p>***</p><p>It had become easier to fight against three people at once, but Matsuku, Genta and Shime were actually the ones who needed to work on their teamwork. Hokuto wouldn’t give them a single chance to reorganize after falling apart. They were more indeed, but the Fallen were stronger and luckily Myuto had also volunteered with the others to help prepare the Chasers for what was coming. </p><p>“Take a break,” Hokuto finally announced, making Matsuku fall to his knees with a sigh.</p><p>“How can you be a Vestige and not a Fallen? Like seriously you’ve done this for two days straight, even letting Kentaro, Myuto and Reo attack you for over an hour. How are you still standing?”</p><p>“That’s exactly what you have to learn then we won’t have any trouble with them,” Hokuto explained, but Kochi gave him a worried look from the door. He had asked him several times now to take at least a small break. It wouldn’t help if Taisuke suddenly attacked them after all and Hokuto would be unable to even stand.</p><p>“How about we train without abilities for a while?” Moro offered, but Genta shook his head.</p><p>“No way, I am not going to fight you without my abilities. That is even more exhausting.”</p><p>“But also more fun for me and who knows what special abilities they have? So you might want to train in any way possible?”</p><p>Shime was the only one who didn’t complain about the way too short break and stepped in front of Moro, the others following a bit more reluctantly while Hokuto walked up to Kochi.</p><p>“You come with me,” Kochi announced, leaving no chance for Hokuto to even decline. “Let me run a few tests on your stamina level okay? Then I want you to sleep at least for a few hours, please?”</p><p>“Fine, but I am really okay,” Hokuto explained on their way to the lab. At least physically he felt fine, mentally he was still too angry to even give any other emotion the chance to break through.</p><p>“I have sleeping pills that work for Vestige and Fallen so if you feel like it’s impossible to rest, I can give you one later,” Kochi offered, realizing Hokuto’s struggle.</p><p>“I’m really fi-”</p><p>As if brought out of balance, Hokuto had to reach out for the wall and he couldn’t clearly see for a moment, but he couldn’t explain what was going on.</p><p>“Hokuto, are you okay?” Kochi asked worried, but before he could reach out for him, Hokuto was forced on his knees. It felt like something was pulling on his mind and he put his hands up to his head with a hiss, unable to clearly hear Kochi’s shouting next to him.</p><p>It wasn’t actually pain, not the physical kind of at least and then he could somehow feel something. Fear...so much fear and he knew who it belonged to and he started shaking, falling to the front with a scream. His own fear he had tried to hide under his anger was breaking free as well.</p><p>“What is going on?” Aran’s voice next to Kochi. Suddenly completely clear again and with wide eyes Hokuto sat up, making both of them step back.</p><p>“Hokuto?” Kochi asked carefully, not sure how to react to Hokuto’s sudden forth and back of emotions. “What happened? What is going on?”</p><p>Unable to get back up for now, not sure if his shaking legs would carry him, Hokuto tried to explain, but it was difficult to find words.</p><p>“I felt something. I felt a huge amount of fear and it wasn’t my own.” Hokuto’s explanation made the other two exchange worried looks. “It wasn’t really like I saw any pictures or faces, but I know that the fear belonged to Taiga.”</p><p>“Okay now you freak me out,” Kochi announced and helped Hokuto up while Aran stabilized him on the other side. “Now you will get your break no matter what you say, because it’s research time.”</p><p>Hokuto couldn’t even complain, because whatever connection Taiga had established could maybe help finding out what was going on or even find his location.</p><p>“Did it hurt?” Aran asked, a bit worried about Hokuto's empty stare, but then the other one shook his head.</p><p>“It wasn’t any pain that made me scream. It was more like I felt afraid? I am not sure how to explain it, but if Taiga is feeling so much fear right now then I am not sure if Taisuke will keep his promise and not kill him.”</p><p>***</p><p>It hadn’t been a comfortable rest, but even lying unconscious on a stone floor was enough for Taiga to finally feel at least a bit better. He was alone in the training room, but the only way out was the staircase and he was sure that someone was upstairs. Carefully he got up and he tried to remember the feeling from before, the instinct Taisuke had awoken in him.</p><p>“The survival of the fittest,” Taiga said, but couldn’t actually bring back the strength he had used before, so it wasn’t like his abilities were completely back. He had so many questions, yet he wasn’t sure if he should ask. After all, Taisuke never did something without a plan and there was so much that could backfire in this situation, yet Taiga finally decided to get up the stairs.</p><p>To his surprise no one crossed his way on the next floor, but he wasn’t sure if he should just look for another staircase so he made his way to the research room he had been in before.</p><p>Inside he found Miyata and Yokoo, but none of them seemed surprised about him walking around this carefree.</p><p>“Taisuke is waiting outside for you,” Yokoo let out neutral when he looked up from one of his screens. “The staircase is in the right corridor.”</p><p>Now Taiga wasn’t sure anymore if they were making fun out of him or testing him, but then Miyata walked over to him with some glass tubes. “You are kind of in the way.”</p><p>First Taiga was close to letting out an apology, but then he bit his lip and stepped back, leaving the room with an unsure feeling. Was he really allowed to walk around alone? And even go outside? On the other hand, it was obvious that Taisuke wasn’t going to be outside alone. Even if the others weren’t right around them, they would definitely be watching and running wasn’t an option, at least not yet.</p><p>The staircase on this floor was more of a ladder and a thread had to be turned to open a metal plate, which Taiga pushed up so that he could step out on the forest floor surrounding it. There was no way anyone would find this if they didn’t stumble right on top of it. The color was of the same kind as the surrounding and with all the trees even harder to spot.</p><p>Even though it was in the middle of winter the temperature was close to a warm spring day, but with an annoying humidity in the air, yet Taiga preferred that over snow.</p><p>The sound of another waterfall made Taiga look up to an opening between the trees where more sunlight made its way on an open surface.</p><p>When he walked out to the rocky surface he found Taisuke standing next to the waterfall, looking down into the gorge in front of them. The cliff was way steeper and higher than the one they had been at before with the others and they had walked uphill a lot towards this place so Taiga guessed that Taisuke and the others had been able to spot them coming from up here already.</p><p>“Finally back to full strength?” Taisuke asked without turning away from the cliff.</p><p>“If you give me back my abilities,” Taiga let out and it made a smile appear on the other one’s face as he looked over his shoulder.</p><p>“Not yet or your training will be useless.”</p><p>“Why did you teach me about the survival of the fittest?”</p><p>“Because I wanted to see if you have it.”</p><p>“Don’t all Fallen have it?” Taiga asked, having been taught until now that the Fallen DNA changed their thinking to a primitive and instinct driven way, making them believe in the survival of the fittest and nothing else.</p><p>“Have you ever seen a Fallen use it?”</p><p>On that question Taiga needed to think for a moment, because had he? Even when the others had been losing in a fight, none of them had shown a sudden strength like the one Taiga had shown.</p><p>“The government uses that phrase to look down on us, but it’s more than just a failure in their DNA research as they call it.”</p><p>“Do you possess it?”</p><p>With a lopsided smile Taisuke finally turned towards Taiga. “Don’t you know the answer already?”</p><p>Of course he did, but that made things even more dangerous. With the instinct Taisuke could easily win against several Fallen.</p><p>“I felt that you possessed the same instinct when I read your mind, but you weren’t able to use it as your Fallen transition was different. Even under real Fallen it’s more than rare to see someone able to use their full potential.”</p><p>“But Hokuto had been half Vestige, the DNA mutation had been transformed so much by that time, how was his Fallen self able to still possess this instinct?”</p><p>“That’s something I want to know too,” Taisuke explained and started walking away from the cliff with his hands on his back. “My theory is that his Fallen self had to fight against the Vestige self to even get a place in Hokuto’s new DNA and that was actually what made it so much stronger than other Fallen.”</p><p>“So the Vestige have lost the ability to awaken that instinct completely,” Taiga said and ended up deep in his thoughts about what had happened inside his mind while he had awoken that instinct. But Taisuke hadn’t said anything about any new awakening abilities so he needed to make sure to keep his new connection to Hokuto a secret. He flinched when Taisuke’s hands landed on his cheeks the next second, but then he relaxed as Taisuke wasn’t able to steal his mind reading while his abilities were blocked.</p><p>“Fallen know when someone is stronger than them, that is why we form groups without having to fight for a leader position.”</p><p>“That is why Myuto didn’t fight you,” Taiga knew already and Taisuke clapped him on the cheek before he pulled back, but didn’t step away, making Taiga feel a bit uncomfortable, but he couldn’t step back with the cliff behind him.</p><p>“Then tell me why did you attack me?”</p><p>That was something Taiga also wanted to ask, but the answer scared him a bit, because what if this wasn’t how Taisuke wanted Taiga’s new found instinct to turn out? “I tested my strength and while I didn’t attack you the same as Nika, I was confident enough to think that I stand a chance.”</p><p>“And would you?” Taisuke asked with an excited shine, yet something dangerous as well. What if Taiga was stronger than him? Would he just get rid of him in case he would learn how to overpower him?</p><p>“I don’t know. For now I don’t even know how I controlled that instinct,” Taiga replied honestly.</p><p>“That’s why your training needs to go into the next stage now. The moment you can control it on your free will you will know where your strength limit is.”</p><p>“How do you control it?” Taiga asked, not even sure if he wanted to know, because if he was indeed stronger than Taisuke wanted him to be, then things could turn out way more dangerous than expected. Not that Taiga understood why Taisuke was teaching him in the first place. After all, if Taisuke was the only Fallen with the ability to control the survival of the fittest then he could just rule over everyone alone, right?</p><p>“I will show you,” Taisuke said promisingly as he put his hand on Taiga’s chest this time and once more his look changed, but Taiga had no time to react. The shockwave hit him without a warning and he wasn’t even sure if he had screamed or not the moment the rocks under his feet were gone and he realized that Taisuke had just pushed him off the cliff into a freefall to his death.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>“Nothing?”</p><p>Kochi shook his head on Hokuto’s question, but he wasn’t really sure what he had expected. It wasn’t like he had done something. This wasn’t anything connected to his own abilities, so of course Kochi’s research didn’t necessarily bring any answers.</p><p>“So did Taiga get a new ability?” Aran asked, but it was obvious that they all couldn’t really answer that.</p><p>“We have absolutely no clue what Taisuke and the other Fallen are capable of and the worst part is that we know that Taiga was of Taisuke’s interest, but the reason behind it is still unknown to us.”</p><p>“What’s on your mind?”</p><p>Aran needed a moment to realize that Hokuto’s question was for him and he sighed with a thoughtful expression. “Myuto wanted you in our group, because you were almost as strong as him and he wanted to make sure to have your Fallen self on his side instead of having to fight him.”</p><p>Slowly Kochi nodded on hearing that, but then he gasped as he had caught up to what Aran had said. Hokuto didn’t seem that surprised as he had already feared for a similar reason.</p><p>“So wait, Taisuke is trying to get Taiga on his side?”</p><p>“It would make sense, right? Taiga has the strength of Hokuto’s Fallen self and knowing that Myuto and the others wouldn’t return to his side now that they have gotten the serum, he might want to try his luck with Taiga? It’s just a theory though,” Aran added.</p><p>“But why would Taiga even think about joining them? Sure I can imagine that they can hurt him a lot, but he even said he will return him to us and not kill him,” Kochi said, trying to somehow make sense out of Taisuke’s actions.</p><p>“But he also said we might have another fight before that, right?” Hokuto said, now an even darker expression on his face.</p><p>“Do you think he could turn Taiga against us?” Kochi finally asked what they all didn’t want to voice out.</p><p>“Taisuke is unfortunately capable of a lot of things. We were able to divide a Fallen and Vestige into two bodies, resulting in the first Fallen who was in control of his senses and emotions. What if Taisuke’s followers have come up with something even more advanced? After all, a lot of them had been part of the research in the first place.”</p><p>A shiver went through Kochi’s body just thinking about it, but they should be prepared for any possible outcome.</p><p>“Kochi, can you give me one of the sleeping pills you talked about earlier,” Hokuto asked, making the other one blink at him in confusion for a moment before he got up and handed him the medicine. “Let’s keep what we discussed a secret for now, okay? I bet Juri and also Myuto have already caught up on it as well, but we don’t need everyone to worry even more.”</p><p>Both of the researchers looked after Hokuto in slight worry as he left the lab without any other discussion and then Aran looked at Kochi with a knowing look. “He is the one who is worried the most, isn’t he?”</p><p>“But he matured a lot,” Kochi added with a faint smile. “Just half a year ago he would have stormed out to search for Taiga by himself after such a talk. But I think now he realized that instead of running in his own doom he can make sure to become stronger and get ready for whatever awaits us when Taiga returns.”</p><p>***</p><p>There hadn't been any time to even think. Now it was really all about an instant reaction, that one instinct that could save Taiga's life, because without his abilities he wouldn't be able to absorb the impact.</p><p>Faster than the first time his instinct took over, but at the same time his new found telepathy did too. But there was not much time to even realize what he had felt or shared. His own fear had been of a completely different level this time. No one was able to help him so it was all up to him to rescue his own life. What he felt from Hokuto this time was different. The anger was still there, but somehow suppressed and there was more of a numbness. An empty and scared feeling that made Taiga want to reach out for the other one and tell him that it was going to be okay, because he was not going to die like this!</p><p>All his thoughts had crushed on him in a split second, giving him enough time to finally awaken that survival instinct, which allowed him to see his surroundings in slow motion and reach out for the rocky surface next to him. First he wasn't able to get a grip on anything as he was falling too fast, but soon he was able to control his own fall and finally slow it down by somehow stepping on some stones, which broke under the pressure, but slowed him down until he landed on the rocky surface of the gorge.</p><p>The impact had still been extremely hard and his legs would need a moment of regeneration to be able to function again, but he had indeed survived.</p><p>With heavy breaths he remained in that position for a moment until Taisuke showed up in front of him. Slowly he had jumped down the cliff, following Taiga on a safe distance and now he looked really pleased.</p><p>"Such a quick learner."</p><p>As before Taiga already felt dizzy, but his anger had reached its peak and this time he dashed to the front the same way as he had done with Nika.</p><p>Taisuke seemed startled for a moment as Taiga didn't stop attacking right away. For the first time Taisuke had to actually dodge Taiga's attacks and jump on distance. Taiga was confident enough to keep going even without his abilities, yet his body wasn't used to his instinct yet and again he fell to his knees, unable to get up.</p><p>"Mh, interesting. You don't seem to accept me as you leader."</p><p>"Give me my abilities back and I'll show you who the leader is," Taiga hissed, not even sure if it was his own voice he heard and Taisuke also lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>"Careful with that instinct, if you don't watch out it can also swallow you."</p><p>"You're the one who taught me so now you have to deal with it," Taiga threatened and Taisuke still seemed more amused than annoyed, but Taiga didn't miss how he remained on distance.</p><p>"Guess it's time to level things up then. You seem more than ready to finally get your abilities back."</p><p>It was a chance for Taiga to overpower Taisuke, but with the way the other one still seemed so confident he wasn't sure if Taisuke still had anything else up his sleeve. But for now his body gave up on him once more. This time though he felt like he was able to control his instinct better than the first time and he tried to remember this feeling for the next time Taisuke tried to kill him.</p><p>***</p><p>When Hokuto had decided to take the sleeping pills it had only been noon, but he didn't care. He realized how messed up he was and sleep would help him get a grip on his emotions for now.</p><p>But even in his sleep he felt like he got haunted by all the chaos around them. He felt like chasing after Taiga in a dream even though he couldn't clearly see him. Why was the other one not stopping, even though he was calling out for him?</p><p>At one point he felt like he had been pulled out of his dream, but he still wasn't awake, not completely at least. He had been pulled somewhere else, Taiga now closer to him, but when he tried to reach out for him, everything turned upside down and he shouted Taiga's name as he saw the other one falling. As if it was himself falling he screamed, sure that he would die and he wasn't able to neither safe Taiga nor himself.</p><p>It was his own scream, which pulled him back to reality and he jumped up, but immediately fell to his knees next to the bed as if the abyss he had just seen was still way too real.</p><p>When he could feel a presence closing in to his room he tried to get up once more, but his whole body was shaking. It was paralyzed by the fear of dying.</p><p>"Hokuto? Are you okay? Can we come in?"</p><p>"Yes... I'm fine," Hokuto let out in a shaking voice, but the door still opened and he saw Shintaro and Juri looking at him with wide eyes.</p><p>"What happened? We heard you scream until the training room," Juri explained as he stepped in and helped Hokuto to sit on the bed. "Well at least the Vestige and Fallen did."</p><p>"It's hard to explain," Hokuto said, not even sure what else to say. "Something similar happened earlier, but Kochi couldn't find anything so we decided to keep it a secret for now."</p><p>"Is it connected to Taiga?" Juri asked as he had of course already somehow connected the dots.</p><p>"Wait, you can communicate with him? Did your mind reading ability change?" Shintaro asked, but Hokuto shook his head.</p><p>"It's Taiga reaching out to me, I can't control it. I only get emotions and weird pictures I can't make sense of, but it seems that it always happens when Taiga fears something. But this time it was different from the first one."</p><p>"What changed?" Juri asked while Hokuto clenched his fists as they didn't want to stop shaking.</p><p>"The first time Taiga was afraid yet still angry, but this time he was terrified. It felt like he was afraid of dying."</p><p>There was no reply on that statement and Shintaro shifted positions with a troubled expression.</p><p>"Make sure to keep this to yourself. The more people will get to know about this, the more restless everyone will get. We don't need anyone to run out and try to find Taiga."</p><p>"The first one who would do that is you and as long as you keep it together, we can too."</p><p>They looked up to Myuto who had stepped into the doorframe. "As long as Taiga keeps contacting you with whatever that new ability is, we know that he is alive and that means we don't have a reason to go after Taisuke."</p><p>"Is he still alive?" Shintaro dared to ask as Hokuto had said he felt like Taiga was afraid of dying.</p><p>"I don't know how exactly this telepathy or however you want to call it works, but I feel like I'd know if he dies," Hokuto explained.</p><p>"Then don't keep his updates a secret from now on. We are all worried for him," Myuto said a bit scolding this time and Hokuto nodded, knowing that it was maybe also easier for him if the others knew what was going on.</p><p>Maybe if they were able to strengthen their connection he could receive even clearer updates, which were not connected to just his fear.</p><p>***</p><p>It was after Taisuke hadn't let Taiga enter the hideout again that it was clear that he wouldn't get another break. Especially when Nika, Mitsu and Tama joined them when it had already turned dark outside. His abilities had finally returned as well and without Senga on the team he could at least hope that he could keep them for whatever was going to happen.</p><p>"This is your final test," Taisuke explained as he walked away from him, stopping next to the other Fallen.</p><p>"So what is it this time? You want to try and kill me with four people at once?”</p><p>Taisuke let out a chuckle on that, but then he shook his head. "This time it won't be that easy."</p><p>Not that it was in any way easy for Taiga to survive and control his instinct until now.</p><p>"This is going to be a hunt."</p><p>"A hunt?" Taiga asked with a raised eyebrow, yet it already dawned on him what kind of twisted idea Taisuke had planned out.</p><p>"The time limit is 24 hours. You get a one minute headstart and then we will hunt you."</p><p>"And if you get me, you will try to kill me."</p><p>"Don't ruin the surprise!" Taisuke growled annoyed by the fact that Taiga had figured that part out already. "But yes. If none of us catches you and is able to kill you in the next 24 hours then you win."</p><p>"What if I get to my Center?"</p><p>"You're free to try," Taisuke challenged, but it was obvious that they had the advantage of the area and it would be difficult for him to make it towards the Center with them knowing where he was aiming for.</p><p>"What happens if I win?"</p><p>That question had Taisuke form a lopsided sneer and he tilted his head. "A surprise!"</p><p>"What else," Taiga hissed.</p><p>"If you don't want it then feel free to lose," Taisuke said and shrugged his shoulders before he started to count down from five.</p><p>There was no way Taiga would get killed this easily and no one said he wasn't allowed to kill them instead, not that he was aiming for that.</p><p>"Two...one…"</p><p>With a last annoyed look, Taiga turned around from the Fallen and dashed towards the forest.</p><p>As they were all Fallen none of them needed any sleep or breaks, yet Taiga finally dared to stop running as he could see the first light making its way over the tips of the mountains. He had eventually chosen to run northwards, because he knew that it was too risky to try and run towards the Capitol or even his Center.</p><p>For hours he hadn’t seen any of the others, but while it was an advantage that they couldn’t feel each other’s presence it was also a disadvantage, because he couldn’t use his presence finding with them.</p><p>Since the war had started there were almost no people living in the countryside anymore, yet Taiga had made sure to keep his presence finding on alert as he didn’t want to involve any innocent humans in Taisuke’s stupid games.</p><p>To not get thrown off any cliff again, Taiga made sure to hide in a gorge between some mountains for now. Next to him a river was flowing, but it was quite deep and fast flowing with sharp rocks so he made sure to keep his distance.</p><p>His biggest worry was that they were all going after him in a pack. In that case even his instinct might not be enough to save him. On the other hand...Taisuke was able to fight them all off through his instinct and what if Taiga was indeed stronger than Taisuke through his instinct? With another look around, Taiga finally dared to concentrate on something else. He wanted to see if he could get his telepathy working, but as expected it wasn’t working like a normal ability and he couldn’t just use it at free will, at least not yet. The same as with the instinct itself it felt like Taiga needed to put a certain amount of emotions into his telepathy.</p><p>It was the moment when Taiga stepped out of the shadows of the mountain, next to the river that he knew he had spaced out too much and stopped too soon with running away.</p><p>The other one had been still too far away for him to hear him or spot him, but unfortunately his ability worked from far away and Taiga’s body was paralyzed in an instant.</p><p>He cursed at his body to move, but it wasn’t that easy to get out of Mitsu’s paralysis as with Myuto’s motion control and his instinct wasn’t that easily activated either.</p><p>The only good point was that Mitsu had used it when he was still far away and Taiga could hear him jumping down to the river, but right before he had reached him, he was able to jump away.</p><p>“Guess now I have to keep you busy until I can use my ability again,” Mitsu let out challenging, but it didn’t seem like he had aimed to kill Taiga this fast in the first place.</p><p>What Mitsu hadn’t seen coming at all was Taiga attacking without even bothering with a reply. It took Mitsu a great effort to actually dodge Taiga’s attack and stop him from pushing him towards the river. Before Taiga could hit a shockwave, Mitsu had jumped to the back with a surprised look.</p><p>“What? You didn’t really think I was easy to beat just because I am different from you? Remember that I am still a Fallen,” Taiga warned the other one, speaking a bit too arrogantly on purpose, hoping it would make Mitsu hesitate a bit.</p><p>“Then I guess it’s good to have an advantage on my side.”</p><p>Mitsu’s words didn’t make any sense to him until it was too late. With the noise of the water it was even difficult for Fallen to hear their surroundings and he had missed that Tama had sneaked up on him from behind.</p><p>Instead of attacking with a shockwave, he grabbed Taiga’s arms, putting all his strength into stopping Taiga from escaping his grip and unfortunately Tama’s strength was more than expected.</p><p>“Now I don’t even have to wait for my abilities to recharge,” Mitsu let out with a lopsided smile as he approached Taiga who tried to twist out of Tama’s grip, but realized that Tama would break his arms if necessary to keep him immobile. After all, Taisuke had allowed them to kill Taiga if they got the chance.</p><p>All Taiga needed was one free hand, yet that was the main problem and Mitsu was more careful now as well and didn’t approach him that lightly. When Tama kicked his knee from the back so that he was forced down, Mitsu finally dared to get closer, knowing that Taiga couldn’t easily attack him like this. “So now the question is do we get rid of you right away or are we just playing a bit and leave the rest to Taisuke?”</p><p>“Are you so afraid of my instinct or why don’t you try killing me right away?” Taiga provoked them and hissed the next second when Tama almost dislocated his shoulder.</p><p>“You won’t even have time to use your untrained instinct. Taisuke can control it at any time, while you only survived until now, because Taisuke let you test your instinct.”</p><p>It made sense, after all in each situation he still had a bit time to get his instinct working. On the other hand it was an instinct not an ability, right? So no matter how fast his life was in danger, his instinct should kick in. But a certain amount of control was still definitely part of it. Taisuke wasn’t weakened through it, while Taiga kept fainting after using it.</p><p>“If you had full control over it then even my ability wouldn't be any trouble for you,” Mitsu let out and Taiga gave him a confused look.</p><p>“Oh you still haven't caught up to that?” Tama asked laughing.</p><p>“Then let’s see if you are a fast learner or this will be the end of the hunt,” Mitsu said and the next second he lifted his hand and Taiga could feel how his body was paralyzed once more. What made him panic though was Tama dragging him over to the river.</p><p>“If you don’t hit any sharp rocks and can hold your breath long enough you might survive,” Mitsu explained with an entertained expression, while Tama lunged out and hit Taiga under the ribs, making him gasp. “But we don’t want to make it too easy, right?”</p><p>With those words Tama threw Taiga into the ice cold water, the stream immediately dragging him away and pushing him underwater. He didn’t even have time to take a deep breath and the first rock he hit with his back, made him lose the bit of air he had left. But with Mitsu’s abilities he would only need to wait a few more seconds to be able to move again, except Mitsu had could use his ability for longer as well with a longer research time.</p><p>The next rock he hit in the strong current opened a cut on the back of his head and he intuitively tried to breath in, ending with him swallowing water and feeling like blacking out. He didn’t want to die this easily! But he needed to get rid of Mitsu’s ability or his instinct would be useless.</p><p>When Taiga’s panic reached its peak as he was sure that this time even his instinct wouldn’t help him anymore he realized his mistake! The missing part! As if a switch had been pulled down with his thoughts he was able to move. And not because Mitsu’s ability had worn off. This was what Taiga hadn’t realized so far.</p><p>At the next stone he was able to turn away and hit it with his foot. With all the strength he could come up with he jumped out of the water and landed on the side next to the river, coughing in pain.</p><p>“Oh, congrats you didn’t die.”</p><p>The fact that the other two had followed him down the stream to see if he survived made more anger rise inside of him, but while his instinct told him to jump up and fight, he was faster this time and for the first time he was able to shut the instinct out again before he could faint.</p><p>“And did you learn anything?” Mitsu asked mockingly.</p><p>“Taisuke isn’t immune against any ability,” Taiga let out and Tama clapped his hands in amusement on his right answer.</p><p>“The instinct is able to overcome every single ability, but it needs to be focused on the spot. If used too long it will make us faint.”</p><p>Against Nika he had already experienced it as he had been able to block Nika’s pain infliction and also Senga’s ability blocking, but at that time he hadn’t even realized what he was doing. But knowing that Taisuke’s immunity against their abilities was only because of his instinct he wished he could tell the others about that secret.</p><p>That one thought made him feel dizzy all of a sudden and he shut his eyes for a moment and put one hand to his head.</p><p>“Seems like you’re still not good at controlling your instinct though,” Mitsu said, but that wasn’t the case. This wasn’t his instinct or at least not directly. It was his new found telepathy, which didn’t interrupt him this time when he had used the instinct. He tried to get a hold of it as best as he could. Putting all the experience he had with his mind reading into his telepathy. It wasn’t like he was forming clear words in his head, but somehow he felt that whatever he was doing, reached Hokuto.</p><p>“Guess we have to fight for real this time.”</p><p>Tama’s words made him finally land back in reality and he hurried to get up and jump away before he got trapped once more. This time he didn’t hesitate, knowing that even against two Fallen he should be able to stand a chance. He wouldn’t put all his hopes into his instinct, but at least it was a backup plan.</p><p>Not giving them any chance to get behind him, Taiga went straight for Tama first, but he didn’t plan on fighting him for too long. All he did was attack so fast that he could finally find an opening and send him away with a shockwave, so that he could go for Mitsu.</p><p>There was no way he had enough time to win against them with only his basic ability, but he needed to play for time.</p><p>“If you think you can overpower me then you got yourself the wrong opponent,” Mitsu mocked him, but that wasn’t what Taiga aimed for. All his attempts to get his hands on Mitsu’s face got blocked, but of course Mitsu knew about Taiga’s mind control ability so he tried to stay away.</p><p>When Taiga dared to look over his shoulder to see if Tama was approaching again, Mitsu used his opening to attack with a shockwave. But while Mitsu thought he had gotten the upper hand, this was exactly what Taiga had hoped for. The shockwave took him off his feet, but it also threw him right towards Tama who had started dashing towards them again. Unable to dodge, Taiga landed half on him and that was his chance to get his hands on the other one’s face.</p><p>“STOP IT,” Mitsu shouted, but it was too late already. His mind control didn’t take longer than a second to work, but neither did his ability to get into his mind. So Taiga used the few seconds he had to try and get as much information as he could.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - February</strong>
</p><p>“I don’t care if you have found a mistake in the system. I won’t rewrite this, just because a kid tells me to,” Tama let out and rolled his eyes, but the boy next to him who seemed way too young to be wearing the research clothes Tama was in, wouldn’t just leave like this.</p><p>“Fine, then you will get yelled at by the higher ups if this whole DNA series fails.”</p><p>With a groan Tama put his hands up to his temples, before he turned back to the boy. “Why do I need to take care of the kid?”</p><p>“First, I have a name, it’s Noel. I told you when I introduced myself, which you didn’t by the way, but don’t worry, I have already memorized all the researchers names in this base. And second, I might be younger than a lot of you, but I am the one who is making sure that none of you gets fired for the stupid mistakes you make.”</p><p>“Did you just call me stupid?” Tama asked, turning back to Noel, who didn’t even seem to see the need to apologize.</p><p>“I called all of you stupid.”</p><p>“Makes it so much better,” Tama said sarcastically before he pointed at the screen. “Then go ahead super boy. If you mess up the system, I am so going to put all the blame on you.”</p><p>---</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - August</strong>
</p><p> “What do you mean I will get transferred? You can’t get the new system working without me. We are on this for six months now,” Noel complained after he had established the best team work he had ever had with someone, but Tama’s decision was final.</p><p>“It is because it took us so long that they took you out.”</p><p>“Why me and not you?” Noel asked, but Tama wasn’t getting angry at him anymore. He had weirdly gotten used to Noel’s ongoing arrogant talking, which was amusing him more now than actually annoying him.</p><p>“This is not my decision and I can’t reverse it. By tomorrow I want you to have your lab emptied, is that clear?”</p><p>“But that makes no sense, let me talk to-”</p><p>“No! You are not gonna talk to them. You will go to your new base and that is an order!”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>Taiga could still feel all the troubled emotions when he released Tama and jumped away before Mitsu could reach him. But when Tama was the one attacking Mitsu, he could finally catch his breath for a moment.</p><p>“Tama, snap out of it,” Mitsu yelled at the other one, but Taiga had made sure to use his mind control as precisely as possible. He gave Tama another apologizing look before he took his chance and dashed away from them.</p><p>No matter how they were now as Fallen, they all had their own painful past. Shime’s friends were the same as Taisuke’s group. None of them had made any easy decisions back then and even if it seemed like they had pushed the others away, Taiga knew more, could feel more, through his mind reading. He knew that if he looked into all their memories he would find similar stories. They had all protected the younger generation! Pushing them away was their only chance of getting them out, but now they didn’t even remember why they had done it. Luckily Shime and the others did and they would stop at nothing to rescue them, which meant Taiga needed to survive to tell them about everything.</p>
