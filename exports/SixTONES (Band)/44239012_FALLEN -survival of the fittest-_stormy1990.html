      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>For years the West Center had thought their biggest enemy were Myuto and the Fallen following him. After they had succeeded in getting Aran on their side and make a Reverse serum to turn the Fallen DNA into a new mutation, which allowed them to keep their Fallen abilities and strength, but freed them from the emotionless mind set of the survival of the fittest, the West Center had falsely though that they could move on into a new era without Vestige and Fallen trying to kill each other while the ultimate mistake lay at the Government not taking responsibility for their own impropriate illegal DNA mutation research.<br/>For Taiga and Hokuto a new fight had started with the destruction of the East Center and while they now needed to try to protect their own Center they would eventually have to sacrifice more than they were willing to!</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Welcome back to the sequel of CHASER, I hope you will enjoy this part as well!<br/>Don't be too taken aback by the Cover as KyomoHoku will still be the Main pairing of this fic until the very end, but without trouble the story wouldn't be interesting, right?</p><p>As always be prepared for spelling/grammar mistakes and plot holes<br/>I hope you enjoy reading\^^/</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>Just remembering Taisuke's dangerous glare, his unbeatable copy ability, a speed and strength not even Myuto could stand up against, was too much for Taiga to even be able to think about any plan how they could ever be able to face Taisuke together with the other Fallen he had gathered.</p><p>"Didn't you say your healing ability would make them recover faster?"</p><p>Hokuto's voice. So at least he was safe and they were most likely back at their Center, because the next voice he heard was from Shime.</p><p>"Physically I can heal them faster than our abilities can, but I can't repair mental damage, so after such a fight I guess they all need some more time to get up."</p><p>Which meant as much as Kentaro and Myuto were most likely also still unconscious.</p><p>Feeling the pressure of Hokuto's hand closing around his, Taiga finally fought himself out of all the dark thoughts and he squeezed the other one's hand back.</p><p>"Are you awake?"</p><p>The worried tone made Taiga smile faintly at him when he opened his eyes before he nodded. "Are we at the West Center?"</p><p>"Yes, we got some unexpected help in the end."</p><p>Hokuto explained while Taiga scanned the room. It was their medical station and he could spot Myuto and Kentaro on other beds, with Reo sitting next to Kentaro with a dark expression.</p><p>"You should be okay to get up and walk around," Shime said.  "I have a healing ability so your physical wounds are all good."</p><p>"How about Myuto?"</p><p>"He'll be fine, but just a bit later and maybe even I wouldn't have been able to rescue him," Shime explained with a gloomy expression. "I'm sorry that you had to face Taisuke like this without any warning."</p><p>"It's not like that is your fault," Taiga let out, but then he saw the way Hokuto's expression changed.</p><p>"Is there something I don't know?"</p><p>Shime shifted a bit uncomfortable next to the bed before he bowed apologizing towards Taiga who didn't even know what was going on.</p><p>"I should have said something earlier, but with Myuto and the others around and the focus on the Reverse serum I wanted to wait until I've seen the results."</p><p>"Wait with what?" Taiga asked curiously yet a bit terrified by the way the boy looked so scared.</p><p>"Taisuke is my older brother."</p><p>The missing reaction from Hokuto and also from Reo meant that they had already been told, but Taiga didn't even know what to do with that information.</p><p>"Okay... Thanks for telling us, I guess?" Taiga said a bit lost.</p><p>"You're not angry?"</p><p>"Were they angry?" Taiga asked and pointed at the others, but as expected Shime shook his head.</p><p>"You are not at fault for what your brother does as a Fallen. Not even your brother himself is at fault for that, because he is after all a Fallen and not in control of his emotions."</p><p>The explanation made sense, yet Shime didn't seem to feel better.</p><p>"Where are the others?" Taiga asked instead and Hokuto got up.</p><p>"Let's go meet them. As Shime said you should be fine getting up and Reo promised to have a look at Kentaro and Myuto until they wake up."</p><p>Taiga nodded and got up, relieved to not feel tired or unstable on his feet.</p><p>Shime left together with them, but instead of the lab, they left for the training room.</p><p>"Moro, Hagi and Yuma are in the special Fallen room, waiting for Myuto to wake up. Just then they will agree to get the serum."</p><p>It sounded fair and while Taiga wanted them to feel safe while doing the transition he felt a sudden urge to rush them, because they couldn't stand a chance against Taisuke. But would numbers even matter?</p><p>Sudden loud noises from the training room made Taiga look up at the glass and he found a handful of unknown faces together with Juri, Shintaro and Jesse.</p><p>"Aran and Kochi are in the lab at the moment. They try to improve the serum, so we can go later and talk to them," Hokuto added before he entered the training room.</p><p>“I guess Aran is trying to distract himself instead of sitting next to Myuto and worry,” Taiga realized, but he couldn’t blame him.</p><p>"Taiga, you're awake! How are you feeling?" Jesse asked and hugged him before even waiting for a reply if he was still hurt.</p><p>"All good, no need to worry."</p><p>"This is definitely the most messed up situation we've been in so far," Shintaro added.</p><p>"Are they…?"</p><p>"The ones who helped you yes," Juri explained while Taiga hurried to walk up to the six boys in front of him and bowed.</p><p>"Thank you for your help. I fear without you none of us would have survived."</p><p>One of them laughed and shook his head, but he didn't get up from the ground where he was sitting, leaning to the back instead. "Trust me if Taisuke wanted to kill you then you'd be dead, us most likely as well."</p><p>Unfortunately Taiga had guessed that already, but he didn't want to say it out loud.</p><p>"So you are the Fallen in control of his senses we heard about?" Another one of them asked, scanning Taiga from head to toe with an intense stare.</p><p>Taiga looked a bit worried towards Hokuto, but he also didn't know how they had gotten that information.</p><p>"Let me explain a bit before this gets too complicated," Shime offered and walked up to the other boys. He stopped next to the boy sitting on the ground and who had spoken up first. He had curly black hair, which was already so long that it was hard to see his eyes when he was sitting. “This is Nakamura Kaito. He is a Chaser from the South Center.” The boy just lifted his hand, not bothering with getting up and introducing himself. Not to forget that details had to wait for later. They had a dangerous enemy right in front of their doors and who knew if Taisuke wasn’t planning another attack already.</p><p>Shime stopped next to the boy who had spoken next and put his hand on his shoulder. The boy was the tallest of them all and he had a little bit longer straight black hair. “This is Kawashima Noel. He is the ace of the Chasers in the Main Center.”</p><p>“Now I would have loved to see him compete against Taiga when he was still a Chaser,” Shintaro whispered, but Noel just cracked a smile.</p><p>Shime kept going and pointed at a boy at his left who had red curly hair and a sheepish smile on his lips. “Matsukura Kaito, a Vestige from the Main Center.”</p><p>“Do you have any special abilities?” Juri asked, but the boy shook his head.</p><p>“Wait two of you are called Kaito? This is going to be confusing,” Jesse interfered.</p><p>“Then what would you do if I told you my name was also Kaito?” One of the other boys with slightly wavy black hair said with a teasing smile as he got up and bowed slightly to the others. “My name is Miyachika Kaito. I am a Chaser from the East Center.” </p><p>Shime walked up to him and patted his shoulder. “You can call him Chaka and the other two Matsuku and Umi.”</p><p>“I already have a headache,” Shintaro let out, but with so many new people it was normal that they needed some time to remember everyone in the first place.</p><p>“Our youngest member is Yoshizawa Shizuya, a Chaser from the North Center,” Shime added and pointed at the boy with short black hair and slightly chubby cheeks.</p><p>“And definitely the worst Chaser you have ever seen,” the last boy spoke making Shizu seem slightly embarrassed. “But he puts a lot of passion into his job.”</p><p>Now Shizu seemed even more embarrassed, but Shime pulled everyone’s attention back to the remaining boy. “This is Matsuda Genta from the North Center and he is a Vestige. He is the strongest Vestige in our team.”</p><p>“Is he stronger than Myuto?” Taiga asked and the boy with the dark gray hair nodded.</p><p>“My special ability is to be able to attack with ten times my strength, but of course I need a long recharge time and it only works for a few seconds. I can hold someone down or put enough strength into my grip to even crush bones, but of course Taisuke stays unaffected even by that ability.”</p><p> “Wait, you are all from different Centers, some of you Vestige, others Chasers. What is your connection?” Shintaro asked and then pointed at Chaka. “And why weren’t you at the East Center attack right from the start?”</p><p>The boys all exchanged a troubled expression for a moment before it was Taiga who caught up to the situation first. “You are all connected to Taisuke.”</p><p>“More or less, yes,” Shime explained. “The same as Myuto, Taisuke gathered other Fallen around him, but he didn’t do so to rescue them from the Government. All he wanted was to gather the most skilled Fallen to be able to eventually strike back at the Capitol.”</p><p>“So the Fallen he gathered are connected to the other boys,” Juri said. “Well those details can wait for later I think. For now we need as much information about Taisuke and the other Fallen as we can get.”</p><p>“All of us stood in contact all this time,” Shime started. “We only clashed once with Taisuke and the others, since then they had retreated so far away from the city that we couldn’t find them anymore. When the attack at the East Center happened, Chaka was out with a few Chasers and two Vestige. So luckily he was able to contact us.”</p><p>“That’s why you all came as backup,” Hokuto concluded.</p><p>“You guys gave Taisuke a tough challenge. But you have to think again if you really want to join us against them,” Genta said. “Taisuke likes playing around, but we all had trouble with just him, now imagine him coming with the others.”</p><p>“By then we will luckily have three more Fallen on our side,” Juri said, but he still seemed skeptical as well after all even Myuto and Kentaro hadn’t stood a chance.</p><p>“Taisuke will be a threat to all Centers from now on, so there is no way we will stay back,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“I am really glad to hear that,” Shime said and walked up to Taiga and Hokuto. “I have another request if you are both okay with it.”</p><p>The two boys exchanged a look and nodded before Shime stepped even closer. “To make things easier could you read my mind and show the information to all the other members? Like that we will speed up the explanation part a lot.”</p><p>Shime had a good point there and Hokuto moved first putting his hand on the boy’s temple, before Taiga moved his hand to the other side of the boy’s head.</p><p>“Please don’t hold back. I won’t keep any secrets from you.”</p><p>How much had the boy suffered until now through his brother being a Fallen? Taiga had suffered a lot after finding Myuto as a Fallen and here Shime was a Vestige and still couldn’t get close to his brother as he had turned out to be the strongest Fallen they had ever encountered.</p><p>Hokuto wouldn’t be able to share the memories he would receive, yet he could at least receive them directly so Taiga didn’t need to waste time with transferring them to him and as soon as Myuto was awake again he could help as well.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - October</strong>
</p><p>“What do you mean you want to take part in the trial?” Shime asked perplexed, but Taisuke already put his clothes in his bag.</p><p>“What else can I do? We have been losing this war for years now. Daily I see people die. People who have nothing to do with this, friends who fight right next to me. Don’t you want this to end?”</p><p>Of course Shime wanted the war to end, but he also didn’t want to lose his brother. Every single day he left on another mission from the Government he worried sick until he finally walked back through the door. As a family of soldiers, their father had died in the war already and their mum had also lost her life as a nurse on the front line. But while Shime was only helping out inside the bases, Taisuke was on the front line. A pilot, away from him for weeks sometimes and while they had already said that resources got tight and they would soon not be able to fly over the border anymore, that day had not arrived yet. And the thought of him never coming back from one of those missions made Shime emotionally unstable and sometimes he couldn’t even get up in the morning without getting a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I promise to update you as often as I can, okay?” Taisuke said as he walked up to his little brother and put his hand on his cheek with one of his bright smiles. A smile he didn’t see often anymore as the sorrow of the loss of their parents and the ongoing stress of the war was now mainly seen in his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“You know that I will storm the facility if I don’t hear back!” Shime teased and Taisuke placed a kiss on the boy’s hair.</p><p>“Then I guess I have to make sure that you won’t get expelled for that.”</p><p>“Then don’t break your promise,” Shime whispered as he hugged his brother. The last hug he would ever give him…</p><p>The next time he saw his brother was a whole year later and there was absolutely nothing left of that smile he had wished to see again. But Shime had changed as well. A change which he had seen necessary to be able to even get close to his brother. As expected the promised contact had never come and soon after the disappearance of his brother the news of the Fallen had leaked. Shime had immediately known that his brother must have been among those Fallen or he would have come back to him. Unable to get anyone to help him, he tried for months to find Taisuke, but the Government started to hunt them and force them further away from the city. A civil war against the Fallen had started. First Shime had become a Chaser so that he could try and find Taisuke that way. But he soon realized that he wasn’t in any way suited to fight. At least not as a human. So as the Government suddenly established a new experiment and started sending out Vestige to the Centers against the Fallen he volunteered to become one of them.</p><p>On the same day as he had decided to become a Vestige he had met Matsuku who had made the same decision out of almost the same reasons.</p><p>Just two months after his transition Taisuke showed himself again, this time with a group of six followers. He hadn’t come to take the Main Center down, at least not yet. Maybe he wasn’t sure how strong he was himself at that time, but they could all only be grateful that he retreated or they would have all ended up dead.</p><p>Shime tried to stop his brother from running and now he was finally able to at least catch up with him, not that his strength was enough to stop him.</p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Taisuke’s question wasn’t as ridiculous as it should have sounded. What if he joined them? What if a Vestige went with the Fallen? Maybe he could find a better solution for all of them if he knew more about them?</p><p>“Won’t you come back with me instead?” Shime asked, trying to not sound too desperate. Yet the cold smile his brother showed made him tear up. How could he smile and yet be so emotionless? How could the touch on his face that followed, feel so meaningless.</p><p>“Oh, interesting. I can’t copy your special ability.”</p><p>“Maybe you just don’t want to,” Shime said, but what was he saying? His brother was a Fallen. There was nothing stopping him if he wanted to kill his own little brother now.</p><p>“I fear you won’t be of any use to us,” Taisuke said before he walked away from Shime, but once more he reached out for his older brother. What he didn’t expect was Taisuke turning and moving his hand to the boy’s chest. A common shockwave was what should usually hit him as in training Matsuku’s shockwave had hit him several times as well. But nothing happened and Taisuke lifted an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>“Interesting. Maybe you should join us after all. We could do a lot of research together.”</p><p>Shime shook his head and stepped back, not even having the mindset of using his immunity against Taisuke’s ability to attack his brother. “I wish I would have stopped you that day.”</p><p>“Oh boy, then I would be one of so many dead soldiers by now.”</p><p>“I might prefer that,” Shime let out, not even knowing how such cruel words left his mouth.</p><p>Taisuke seemed to get angry at his words, but before he could do anything, there were sirens heard from the Main Center and a lot of backup was on their way.</p><p>“Then maybe this should remain our last encounter. But be prepared, if you stay with the Government I won’t show you any mercy next time.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>“I remember that attack on the Main Center,” Kochi said after Taiga had come to the lab to show Kochi and Aran what Shime had shown him and Hokuto. He wasn’t able to go through all his memories at once and there were so many linked memories with the other boys that he needed to concentrate on the important parts for now.</p><p>“They told the other Centers to be on backup in case things escalate. They never gave us details about the Fallen who attacked though. But knowing that they had only shown up to scare the Government and make clear that they would be back with a real attack I wonder what the Main Center was thinking? The loss of so many lives at the East Center could have easily been prevented.”</p><p>“I wonder what would have happened if Myuto’s group had challenged Taisuke on their first encounter,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded.</p><p>“Most likely we would have all ended up dead,” Myuto was heard from the open lab door and Aran stood up, hurrying over to him.</p><p>“Are you alright? How are you feeling?”</p><p>“All good. I heard from Reo about Shime and the others. At least the summary.”</p><p>“I can give you the rest of the details,” Taiga offered and Myuto nodded before he lowered his hand from Aran’s cheek to take his hand and squeeze it.</p><p>“You should take a rest. I know you are worried, but you can’t lock yourself in the lab for days.”</p><p>“Could you stay out of my mind?” Aran teased, but of course he knew that the other one was worried and he definitely needed some sleep after they researched on the Reverse serum for this long. “Is Kentaro still asleep?”</p><p>Myuto nodded, but he wasn’t that worried. “Let’s talk to Yuma and the others for now.”</p><p>Aran nodded and left the lab first.</p><p>Myuto turned to Taiga after Aran had left. “You mind?”</p><p>Taiga nodded and stretched out his hand towards Myuto’s face. One part of Shime’s memory that surprised Myuto the same way as Taiga was that Taisuke seemed to completely remember everything from his life as a human. Was he that strong that he could easily deal with his past without his instincts trying to shut them out? For now they wouldn’t get to know.</p><p> It was so much faster to put memories into someone’s mind than talking things through, but Taiga still didn’t want to use this ability too much. It felt like there was still a lot about his own abilities he didn’t know. He felt that his abilities were the same as Myuto’s and if he wanted to he could actually block people’s memories and maybe even alter them, so that they would end up like Aran before. Something he never wanted to even try out.</p><p>***</p><p>“I wish I could take all the stress out of your mind.”</p><p>Hokuto’s words made Taiga turn to the boy who was lying with his back against the backrest with a few pillows behind his back, while Taiga had just sat down with an obvious way too loud sigh.</p><p>“Maybe Myuto could if I ask him?”</p><p>“But I doubt you would?”</p><p>And Hokuto was right, after all their abilities weren’t there to take away headaches or stress. But Taiga couldn’t deny that he felt extremely exhausted after this one day already and there was going to be a lot of chaos waiting for them that was for sure.</p><p>“Do you want to look further into Shime’s memories tomorrow?”</p><p>Taiga shook his head and crawled more onto the bed, resting his head on the other one’s chest as Hokuto invitingly stretched out his arm and played with Taiga’s hair now that he had settled down.</p><p>“I think tomorrow we should leave them all alone for a bit. Kentaro went straight to Yuma and the others when he woke up without even speaking to them and with Aran preparing the serum for them in the morning I think there will be enough chaos.”</p><p>“It fascinates me how they still follow Myuto even though his mind set is now so different,” Hokuto let out, his look absentmindedly on Taiga’s face.</p><p>“He is still as strong as before and they could have easily run over to Taisuke if they thought he was a more fitting leader.”</p><p>“Luckily that will be one less thing to worry about from tomorrow,” Hokuto said relieved and Taiga reached out for the other one’s hand and turned more on his back while he caressed the back of Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>“When you still had to deal with your Fallen self, did you ever feel how he was looking for a strong leader too?”</p><p>“You mean because he wanted to run over to Myuto?”</p><p>Taiga nodded while Hokuto’s hand stopped its movement in Taiga’s hair before he put on a thoughtful expression. “I never really felt his emotions in that way, so I am not sure if he was really looking for leadership or if he just wanted to break free from me.”</p><p>Taiga only nodded once more while both his hands were now putting a bit pressure on Hokuto’s hand and the boy raised an eyebrow at him. “Why did you want to know about this?”</p><p>“Mh? Oh, no specific reason. I think I am just worried that someone could still run over to Taisuke.”</p><p>“Like who? You?”</p><p>Taiga should laugh now, right? Yet he didn’t and Hokuto shifted a bit to be able to look at the other one more directly, but Taiga looked up at him and bit his lip. “That’s a joke, right? You got a serum, which should have actually turned you into a Vestige and just through my Fallen self you got his abilities. Your mind set is in no way the same as a Fallen.”</p><p>“Yet I am a Fallen, Kochi said so too.”</p><p>“And Myuto and the others are also still Fallen and they would never follow Taisuke. They almost died together with us fighting him. Is there something you aren’t telling me?”</p><p>Of course Hokuto would easily catch up with the situation and Taiga finally got up and sat down next to Hokuto, letting his head drop on the other one’s shoulder and luckily the younger one didn’t pull away. “I know I might just be overreacting, because I am so stressed and honestly quite scared about what Taisuke could do to our Center and the Government if he attacks with the Fallen following him.”</p><p>“But?” Hokuto asked, knowing that Taiga would never just start such a serious topic without any good reason.</p><p>“So much unused potential.”</p><p>Taiga’s words made Hokuto raise an eyebrow, but before he could shift away, Taiga hooked his arm with the other one. “Taisuke said that to me when he read my mind.”</p><p>“So what? You think there is still something going on in your mind? Don’t you think Kochi would have realized that by now? Even I couldn't find anything.”</p><p>“It does sound like I am overreacting, right?”</p><p>“It sounds damn scary,” Hokuto said to Taiga’s surprise and with the next move Hokuto placed a kiss on the other one’s hair and pulled him closer. “As long as you don’t hide anything from me or Kochi, I think you should be good? My Fallen self was able to communicate with me, so in case you ever feel like something is going on in your mind we can always run tests, you know? No matter how much our tests proved that you should be perfectly fine.”</p><p>Taiga was grateful that the other one didn’t make fun out of him over such a ridiculous worry, after all he wasn’t hiding anything. But his own weird reaction towards Taisuke on their first encounter and Taisuke’s words somehow made him worry that he wasn’t hiding something, but that something was hiding from him.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Moro, a Fallen that can take away all basic abilities of a Vestige or Fallen through a simple touch, yet his past was marked with blood. His own blood. Always cheerful and showing a smile to his two little cousins he grew up with, after losing his own parents in an attack, when he was still a baby. Yet the war took away the rest of his family as well. Unable to cope with his loss he tried to take his own life. Becoming a Fallen hadn’t been his choice, but now he got a second chance to show his cheerful smile once more.</p><p>Hagi, soundwaves that would paralyze his opponents and take away their ability to find their balance, yet he had always helped children rebalance their lives after losing their loved ones. Until one day he lost them all in an air raid. Losing the ability to believe in human kindness he decided to become stronger to protect those who couldn’t do so themselves. Now he was finally given the chance to do so.</p><p>Yuma, with the ability of overpowering almost everyone with his shockwaves, he possessed the ability to end fights in an instant. Yet he hated fighting, hated violence and wished for nothing more than the end of the war. Unable to remain at the sideline he put his morals aside to fight for the sake of peace. A peaceful era, which he could now help create.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising to Taiga that after the third person he was unable to get up by himself and Hokuto stepped on the platform in the lab to help Taiga get up.</p><p>“I told you to take breaks in between,” Hokuto scolded him.</p><p>Taiga took his hand with a sheepish nod, but then he formed a smile when he looked at the others. “I think it was worth the hurry.”</p><p>All three remaining Fallen had finally received the serum and Aran had also somehow managed to make it at least a bit less painful so that they wouldn’t faint easily anymore, yet Taiga had still offered to help them through it and they had all agreed.</p><p>“Their smiles are beautiful,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded as he watched how Myuto hugged every single one of them. They were all a bit shaken through all the memories Taiga had woken up again, but they were all smiling. There was so much gratitude and hope shining in their eyes now and Taiga wished they could just forget about Taisuke threatening everyone’s new found happiness.</p><p>“Let’s give them a moment,” Hokuto said and left the lab together with Taiga and stopped at the training room where Juri was training with the others to see how skilled they were.</p><p>Hokuto pulled Taiga out of the way right before Umi landed next to them. The others in the room were only the Chasers of their group, so they seemed to have some trouble with Juri even with four against one, but Taiga could understand that as he had faced Vestige and Fallen as a Chaser often enough.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Taiga asked when the boy was up again and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>“All good, only my ego is hurt.”</p><p>“To get such a big ego you should train harder,” Noel scolded him when Juri told them to take a break.</p><p>“Well there can only be one ace after all,” Chaka laughed, but the truth was that if he concentrated a bit more he could also become a quite good Chaser, but he was too chaotic for that.</p><p>“Never let him enter a battle in the same team as Shintaro,” Hokuto said towards Noel who didn’t know much about their Chasers yet, but he gave him a teasing smile obviously understanding that it would be a chaotic choice.</p><p>“Who is the strongest Chaser in your Center?” Shizu asked and Juri pointed at Taiga. “Until he got turned it was Taiga.”</p><p>“Really?” Umi asked, a bit disbelieving. “And here I thought you were as bad as Shizu and that is why you turned.”</p><p>“Let’s say I had a good reason to get stronger,” Taiga said and gave Hokuto a side-glance.</p><p>“Oh, I see, no more questions,” Noel said, getting the hint while Chaka raised an eyebrow at them.</p><p>“What do you see? I don’t get it.”</p><p>“Ask Hokuto I bet he will definitely explain the details to you,” Juri said with a teasing smile towards his friend before he left the training room to meet with Shime and the other Vestige.</p><p>Chaka turned to the one in question, but before he could even voice out anything, Hokuto pointed at him. “I swear I’ll make you regret any question, so zip it!”</p><p>Chaka got the threat faster than the hint so he pressed his lips together and hid a bit behind Shizu.</p><p>“So I think we are done for today then?” Umi said and already headed out to the corridor, when he stopped. “Oh, one of the Fallen is here. What was his name, Kentaro?”</p><p>Taiga turned towards the corridor and he was surprised to find Kentaro alone as he had been with Reo, Myuto and the others in the lab until a few moments ago. After he had finally woken up again he had only met with the other Fallen and had been to the lab, so he hadn’t gotten the time to talk directly to the boys who helped them out. But something on his face made Taiga tense as he didn’t seem in talking mood.</p><p>“Out of my way,” Kentaro hissed and Umi almost jumped out of the way.</p><p>“Didn’t you say he got the serum already?” Noel asked, but Hokuto could only shrug his shoulders.</p><p>“It helps with bringing them back to their senses, but they won’t change their personality.”</p><p>“So no taking Kentaro lightly it is then,” Noel said as he was able to analyze him already.</p><p>“Where the fuck is he?” Kentaro growled, but Taiga could only lift an eyebrow at him and the others also didn’t know who he was talking about.</p><p>Noel looked at Umi, but he shook his head, then he turned to Shizu who shrugged his shoulders, but then he realized that Chaka had completely hidden behind him.</p><p>“Chaka, what are you doing?” Noel asked, but on that question Chaka gave him a scolding look and put his finger in front of his own lips.</p><p>“YOU!” Kentaro shouted and Shizu immediately stepped away from Chaka as he realized that he wasn’t the one in question.</p><p>“What is going on?” Taiga asked a bit panicked, but something told him that he shouldn’t interfere, for now.</p><p>“Wait, I can explain,” Chaka said as he started running backwards when Kentaro approached him with big steps.</p><p>“Have you ever met Kentaro?” Hokuto asked, but Noel shook his head. “Not as long as I know Chaka.”</p><p>With a gasp Chaka hit the wall of the training room now out of running space and he seemed so stressed out that Taiga was on high alert. He doubted that Kentaro would rip him to pieces no matter his anger, but he still wondered what was going on.</p><p>“Ken-chan, let me explain. Please…” Chaka begged, stretching out his arms, obviously more than afraid of what Kentaro could do.</p><p>“Ken-chan?” Taiga asked with a raised eyebrow. Chaka had seen Kentaro when they rescued them, yet he had stayed with everyone in the West Center so things couldn’t be that bad, could they?”</p><p>“There is no need to explain anything,” Kentaro said, his words more threatening than soothing and Chaka almost curled up on the ground when Kentaro grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>“Ehm, okay...now I don’t get anything anymore,” Umi whispered after the whole room had fallen silent the moment Kentaro had pulled Chaka into a hug.</p><p>“Do you put them on drugs or something with that serum?” Shizu whispered towards Hokuto and received a punch against the shoulder from Noel for that stupid comment.</p><p>Chaka didn’t react for a moment with his eyes still wide open in panic and his hands slightly shaking. “You don’t have to explain anything,” Kentaro repeated when he put one hand up to the latter’s back and squeezed him even more. “All I needed to know is that you are safe, you damn son of a bitch.”</p><p>That statement finally made Chaka tear up and hug the other one back, desperately clenching his hands into the back of the other one’s shirt. “I am so sorry for disappearing like that.”</p><p>“He is not his brother, is he?” Hokuto whispered towards Taiga, but he shook his head. He had seen his brother and he was older. But he also hadn’t seen all the memories of course, so most likely he was someone he had lost sight of in the war.</p><p>“Guys, do you want to let us be part of the celebration or not?” Noel asked after giving them a moment to calm down and Chaka hurried to wipe away some tears with his sleeve, before he squeezed Kentaro’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ken-chan and I have been friends since childhood. Our parents were neighbors,” Chaka explained.</p><p>“Then why did he storm in here as if he wanted to kill you?” Umi asked perplexed.</p><p>“Well, Ken-chan always scolded me when I was younger. I got into trouble a lot, often vanished without letting anyone know where I was going and one day…”</p><p>“One day this asshole just didn’t come back,” Kentaro finished for him.</p><p>“Could you stop insulting me?”</p><p>“Never, you moron,” Kentaro teased and ruffled through the other one’s hair.</p><p>“Well, I would be pissed and happy at the same time too if I suddenly found someone who had disappeared like this,” Noel said.</p><p>“Why did you disappear?” Shizu asked and Chaka looked quite embarrassed through the question.</p><p>“I was a way too carefree kid and I loved playing with Ken-chan, his sister and brother, but one day none of them were home and I randomly started searching for them. I know that was stupid, I was still too young and naive to realize how dangerous it was to wander around alone as a child. At some point I didn’t know the way home anymore and just stood there in between all the buildings for hours, waiting for someone to find me. A sudden air raid made everything even more chaotic and in the end I found myself in an orphanage as I had obviously lost consciousness. I tried to explain to them that I had a family and after a few days we were finally able to find my house, but…”</p><p>“But it was too late,” Kentaro said with a dark expression. “That air raid had hit our neighborhood. It killed your parents and my sister.”</p><p>“I thought all this time that you had died as well,” Chaka let out with new tears shining in his eyes. “But when I met your brother again I wondered if you had survived too.”</p><p>First that statement hung in the air for a moment until Kentaro looked up with wide eyes. “What did you just say?”</p><p>Now everyone’s attention was on Chaka who lifted a hand to his mouth as if he just realized that he had said something he shouldn’t have. Even Noel and the others didn’t seem to know.</p><p>“I- I know I need to explain this, but-”</p><p>“Then do. Chaka, where is he?” Kentaro asked and shook him on the shoulders, but Chaka seemed more than reluctant to reply. “Don’t you get how amazing this news is?”</p><p>Kentaro’s excitement wasn’t shared by Chaka and when Hokuto gave Taiga a worried side glance he felt a heavy stone sinking in his stomach. Taiga reached out for the other one’s face and in silence they confirmed what they were both thinking. He was alive, which was indeed good news, but maybe the rest wasn’t as exciting as Kentaro wished it to be…</p><p>“Do you know how happy I was when I saw your name on the list of new members in the lab earlier? I couldn’t believe that you were still alive and now you tell me that you even met my brother? Was he in your Center? Where is he now?”</p><p>Chaka kept looking to the floor, unable to reply, but his silence made Kentaro shake him even more until he finally had enough and grabbed the other one’s hands. “I can’t tell you.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Kentaro asked a bit more calmly this time.</p><p>“Can we talk about this later? I was so happy to find you with the others the other day. Do you know how happy I am that you are alive? Even though you had become a Fallen you got the chance to start over and this is amazing and just for now I want to be happy.”</p><p>His words made Kentaro take a few steps back and then he finally caught up with Chaka’s reaction, with his gloomy look and his attempts to change the topic.</p><p>“No, this can’t be…” Kentaro slowly shook his head.</p><p>Shizu tugged on Noel’s sleeve, but the older one lifted his hand, not wanting to give him any explanations now.</p><p>“He promised to come back on that day…” Kentaro whispered and for the first time there was such hurt visible on Kentaro’s face that Taiga wished he could take away his emotions to give him some peace of mind. “Nika...why…”</p><p>There were so many open questions, yet to their surprise Kentaro got a grip once more and clenched his hands until his fists were shaking and Chaka flinched when he looked up.</p><p>“Where is he now?”</p><p>It was obvious that Chaka didn’t have any other details about Nika, Kentaro’s older brother, but at least his whereabouts he knew. But alone that information could shatter Kentaro even more, yet it was clear that he wouldn’t let it pass in silence and finally Chaka took another deep breath.</p><p>“He is with Taisuke.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Kentaro, we can’t just go and look for him. We have no clue where he is,” Kochi tried to calm down the other one, but Kentaro didn’t even listen to him and only rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest as almost the whole Center had blocked his way.</p><p>After Chaka had told him that his older brother had ended up as a Fallen with Taisuke he had decided to go find him, but of course his idea had been cut short when Myuto got to hear about what had happened and made sure to drag him back into the training room before he could actually storm out of the Center all on his own.</p><p>“I am not a member of this Center, nor a puppet of the Government, I am grateful for your help with the serum and also for Chaka and the others helping out, but this is something I have to do alone.”</p><p>When he tried to get out of the room once more, the other Fallen blocked his way and Reo was the one to walk up to him. “After what we have done over all these years don’t you think you know the outcome already if you find him?”</p><p>“He is my brother,” Kentaro growled at him in annoyance.</p><p>“And Taisuke is Shime’s brother, yet he doesn’t storm out, knowing that it doesn’t make any sense to do so without a plan,” Myuto said while Shime and the others had gone a bit on distance, not wanting to interfere.</p><p>“Shime is no Fallen,” Kentaro countered.</p><p>“And yet Nika will just see you as the same enemy he sees in everyone else,” Taiga spoke up to everyone’s surprise. “Even after I became a Fallen, Myuto still tried to kill me.”</p><p>The truth of these words made Myuto’s look darken, but Kentaro didn’t want to listen.</p><p>“I am well aware of what will await me, but that won’t stop me from going,” Kentaro said and when Reo tried to put his hand on the other one’s shoulder he slashed it away with a warning look.</p><p>“Can’t you wait at least a few more days? We can come up with a plan where to look for them and how to approach them more carefully?” Juri interfered.</p><p>“I don’t need a plan and I don’t need you with me,” Kentaro hissed and passed Reo, but this time Myuto stepped in his way and before Kentaro could lift a hand the other one had pushed him to the back, making Kentaro growl at the other one.</p><p>“You are still part of my team though and I won’t allow you to go,” Myuto ordered, showing that he was as serious about stopping Kentaro as the other one was about leaving.</p><p>“Fine,” Kentaro said, suddenly forming a snappy smile as he turned away and stopped in the middle of the training room and spread his arms. “Then let’s settle this the old fashioned way.”</p><p>“What does he mean?” Shintaro whispered, while he and Jesse kept hiding a bit behind Taiga and Hokuto.</p><p>“You’ll see in a second,” Hokuto let out while he crossed his arms to his chest with a sigh. “Do you think we have to interfere?”</p><p>The question was for Taiga and he looked quite troubled and wasn’t sure if he wanted to nod or not, because the truth was that he could understand why Kentaro wanted to go and also why he tried to leave the others out of it. Kentaro wasn’t as egoistic as he wanted to make the others believe after all.</p><p>“Fine, if you think this is necessary,” Myuto said and stepped in front of Kentaro while the others slowly retreated to the side of the training room, knowing what was coming.</p><p>Between Fallen an argument would usually get settled through a fight and the serum wouldn’t change that kind of thinking for them.</p><p>“I won’t hold back,” Kentaro warned.</p><p>“You better don’t or you won’t have a single unbroken bone left to leave the Center for the next few days,” Myuto warned.</p><p>“I will walk out these gates no matter what,” Kentaro hissed before he dashed to the front, but Myuto hadn’t been bluffing and he lifted his hand, making Kentaro stop with a curse as he couldn’t move freely for a moment, but he was stronger than most of them had expect and Chaka bit his lip in worry as Kentaro screamed at his body to move and he was able to approach Myuto fast enough to make the other one go on distance. Myuto didn’t have to fear Kentaro’s shockwaves, yet his special ability was something that could make him lose.</p><p>“Don’t make me go all out on you,” Myuto warned, but Kentaro just gritted his teeth and sped up once more, breaking completely through Myuto’s motion control this time.</p><p>First Myuto tried to stay on distance until he could recharge, but Kentaro’s anger made it way easier for him to break through that ability so in the end Myuto dared to step into Kentaro’s reach.</p><p>The smaller one tried immediately to get his hands on the other one’s skin, but Myuto was faster than him and he grabbed Kentaro’s wrist and twisted his arm on his back before he reached out for his face. But the time it took for Myuto to try and control Kentaro’s mind, was enough for Kentaro to lift his free hand and reach out for Myuto’s hand. Before anything could happen, the taller one jumped away, leaving Kentaro laughing at him.</p><p>“If you want to stop me then you should use your pain infliction instead of your mind control. You won’t have enough time to get into my mind.”</p><p>“If you want to lose that fast then I can do you that favor,” Myuto said dead serious as he wasn’t happy about hurting a friend, yet he wouldn’t let him run out there into his own death.</p><p>Once more Kentaro took a run up at the other one, but knowing that he couldn’t use his shockwaves and with Myuto on high alert about his special ability, he went for kicks and punches instead.</p><p>But once more Myuto was still the faster one and he could use his shockwaves, so with the next attack Kentaro got thrown through the room and crashed into the wall with a gasp.</p><p>Everyone else remained on distance, not even Reo tried to argue with him. It was clear that he had to lose or he wouldn’t get stopped.</p><p>“Kentaro, you know that we will stop you know matter what,” Myuto reminded him. “Even if you somehow win against me, you need to go through them all to leave.”</p><p>“Then I will win against them as well,” Kentaro shouted after he got up again. “Why do you even care? I never asked any of you to go with me. Just leave me alone!”</p><p>“You know exactly that we would never do that,” Myuto said with a slightly hurt expression while Kentaro got ready for another attack.</p><p>This time Kentaro went all out, ready to put all his remaining energy in defeating Myuto, but his leader wasn’t going to lose just so he didn’t have to hurt his friend, so in the end Myuto went for the one attack he didn’t want to use as Kentaro kept fighting like a wild animal.</p><p>In between Kentaro’s shouting and punching, Myuto lifted his hand, making Kentaro slow down enough to stretch his hand out and grab the other one’s neck. Kentaro immediately reached out for Myuto’s wrists, but this time Myuto’s ability was faster than the other ones as he wasn’t going for mind control.</p><p>With a scream Kentaro went to his knees, but Myuto wouldn’t let go of him as he knew that he needed to make him surrender completely or he would just keep fighting.</p><p>To his surprise Kentaro was still strong enough to use his own ability and soon Myuto gasped on the pain in his chest, which would soon rip his blood system apart if he didn’t hurry.</p><p>“This is for your own good,” Myuto said as he went full out on the other one and in the middle of another scream the room fell silent as Kentaro fell to the back. Myuto was fast enough to move one hand around his back so he wouldn’t hit the ground and Reo hurried towards them and sat down next to Kentaro.</p><p>“Why won’t you just leave me alone,” Kentaro let out in a weak voice, not even opening his eyes, while Myuto got up with a judging look towards him.</p><p>“Because as much as you want us to believe that you want to go alone, because it’s your family problem, we won’t sit back and watch you getting killed, just because you want to keep us away from the fight.”</p><p>Of course Myuto had realized as well why Kentaro wanted to leave in such a hurry, but he wasn’t the only one who wanted to settle things with those Fallen following Taisuke.</p><p>“I know I can’t get him back,” Kentaro let out in an unsteady voice and it was Reo who looked ready to cry the next second. “I don’t want to go to get him back. I want to go to punch him in the face and yell at him for being so selfish and leaving me behind.”</p><p>“I know,” Myuto whispered, clenching his fists. “But how about you trust us instead?”</p><p>This time Kentaro finally opened his eyes, but didn’t get up. Myuto gave him a serious look before he let his eyes wander through the room. “All of these people here in this room have done so much for us and are still trying to help all the other Fallen out there. Chaka and the others have the same right as you to be angry, disappointed or sad about the Fallen following Taisuke, yet they didn’t give in to their emotions. Instead they are all here to help, so for once how about you put your trust in someone else?”</p><p>Not only as a Fallen was Kentaro a lone wolf, but he had been different before losing his family and turning into a Fallen, but it was hard to put his trust into someone, especially when the situation seemed hopeless.</p><p>When Myuto suddenly stepped aside, Kentaro looked up at Chaka who had slowly walked up to them and gave Kentaro an unsure look. “I know as a Chaser I can’t do much, but I trust these guys as much as you trust your leader and the other Fallen,” Chaka explained while looking over at Shime and the others. “I was shocked when I saw Nika as a Fallen. I wanted to take him by the collar and yell at him why he hadn’t protected his family. But it was Shime who taught me how important it was to think rationally and be patient, because you are wrong. You can get him back.”</p><p>Chaka’s direct words had everyone look at the boy, but it brought supporting looks instead of disbelief, because they knew that he was right. Kentaro was just too outraged to see the hope!</p><p>“We have the Reverse serum, we have Fallen on our side, a whole Center behind us and if you give us a bit of time and your trust we can definitely come up with a plan to get Taisuke, Nika and the others back on our side too.”</p><p>When Chaka stretched his arm out towards the older one, Kentaro hesitated for a moment and bit his lip, but when he looked up at Reo, the boy gave him a bright and supportive smile, while Myuto also seemed to have waited for him to finally see past his anger.</p><p>“Under one condition,” Kentaro said, making Chaka raise an eyebrow, but the next second Kentaro had reached out for his hand already and let the other one drag him back on his feet. “I will personally train you before we go out to look for him, because at the moment you would be the first one in this group to die out there.”</p><p>While Chaka pouted, the others in the back started laughing and Shizu hit Noel as he said that he would die with him. But in the end Chaka formed a smile and nodded.</p><p>“As long as you are not the one killing me at that training already.”</p><p>“I can’t promise that.”</p>
