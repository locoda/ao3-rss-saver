      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>For years the West Center had thought their biggest enemy were Myuto and the Fallen following him. After they had succeeded in getting Aran on their side and make a Reverse serum to turn the Fallen DNA into a new mutation, which allowed them to keep their Fallen abilities and strength, but freed them from the emotionless mind set of the survival of the fittest, the West Center had falsely though that they could move on into a new era without Vestige and Fallen trying to kill each other while the ultimate mistake lay at the Government not taking responsibility for their own impropriate illegal DNA mutation research.<br/>For Taiga and Hokuto a new fight had started with the destruction of the East Center and while they now needed to try to protect their own Center they would eventually have to sacrifice more than they were willing to!</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Welcome back to the sequel of CHASER, I hope you will enjoy this part as well!<br/>Don't be too taken aback by the Cover as KyomoHoku will still be the Main pairing of this fic until the very end, but without trouble the story wouldn't be interesting, right?</p><p>As always be prepared for spelling/grammar mistakes and plot holes<br/>I hope you enjoy reading\^^/</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>Just remembering Taisuke's dangerous glare, his unbeatable copy ability, a speed and strength not even Myuto could stand up against, was too much for Taiga to even be able to think about any plan how they could ever be able to face Taisuke together with the other Fallen he had gathered.</p><p>"Didn't you say your healing ability would make them recover faster?"</p><p>Hokuto's voice. So at least he was safe and they were most likely back at their Center, because the next voice he heard was from Shime.</p><p>"Physically I can heal them faster than our abilities can, but I can't repair mental damage, so after such a fight I guess they all need some more time to get up."</p><p>Which meant as much as Kentaro and Myuto were most likely also still unconscious.</p><p>Feeling the pressure of Hokuto's hand closing around his, Taiga finally fought himself out of all the dark thoughts and he squeezed the other one's hand back.</p><p>"Are you awake?"</p><p>The worried tone made Taiga smile faintly at him when he opened his eyes before he nodded. "Are we at the West Center?"</p><p>"Yes, we got some unexpected help in the end."</p><p>Hokuto explained while Taiga scanned the room. It was their medical station and he could spot Myuto and Kentaro on other beds, with Reo sitting next to Kentaro with a dark expression.</p><p>"You should be okay to get up and walk around," Shime said.  "I have a healing ability so your physical wounds are all good."</p><p>"How about Myuto?"</p><p>"He'll be fine, but just a bit later and maybe even I wouldn't have been able to rescue him," Shime explained with a gloomy expression. "I'm sorry that you had to face Taisuke like this without any warning."</p><p>"It's not like that is your fault," Taiga let out, but then he saw the way Hokuto's expression changed.</p><p>"Is there something I don't know?"</p><p>Shime shifted a bit uncomfortable next to the bed before he bowed apologizing towards Taiga who didn't even know what was going on.</p><p>"I should have said something earlier, but with Myuto and the others around and the focus on the Reverse serum I wanted to wait until I've seen the results."</p><p>"Wait with what?" Taiga asked curiously yet a bit terrified by the way the boy looked so scared.</p><p>"Taisuke is my older brother."</p><p>The missing reaction from Hokuto and also from Reo meant that they had already been told, but Taiga didn't even know what to do with that information.</p><p>"Okay... Thanks for telling us, I guess?" Taiga said a bit lost.</p><p>"You're not angry?"</p><p>"Were they angry?" Taiga asked and pointed at the others, but as expected Shime shook his head.</p><p>"You are not at fault for what your brother does as a Fallen. Not even your brother himself is at fault for that, because he is after all a Fallen and not in control of his emotions."</p><p>The explanation made sense, yet Shime didn't seem to feel better.</p><p>"Where are the others?" Taiga asked instead and Hokuto got up.</p><p>"Let's go meet them. As Shime said you should be fine getting up and Reo promised to have a look at Kentaro and Myuto until they wake up."</p><p>Taiga nodded and got up, relieved to not feel tired or unstable on his feet.</p><p>Shime left together with them, but instead of the lab, they left for the training room.</p><p>"Moro, Hagi and Yuma are in the special Fallen room, waiting for Myuto to wake up. Just then they will agree to get the serum."</p><p>It sounded fair and while Taiga wanted them to feel safe while doing the transition he felt a sudden urge to rush them, because they couldn't stand a chance against Taisuke. But would numbers even matter?</p><p>Sudden loud noises from the training room made Taiga look up at the glass and he found a handful of unknown faces together with Juri, Shintaro and Jesse.</p><p>"Aran and Kochi are in the lab at the moment. They try to improve the serum, so we can go later and talk to them," Hokuto added before he entered the training room.</p><p>“I guess Aran is trying to distract himself instead of sitting next to Myuto and worry,” Taiga realized, but he couldn’t blame him.</p><p>"Taiga, you're awake! How are you feeling?" Jesse asked and hugged him before even waiting for a reply if he was still hurt.</p><p>"All good, no need to worry."</p><p>"This is definitely the most messed up situation we've been in so far," Shintaro added.</p><p>"Are they…?"</p><p>"The ones who helped you yes," Juri explained while Taiga hurried to walk up to the six boys in front of him and bowed.</p><p>"Thank you for your help. I fear without you none of us would have survived."</p><p>One of them laughed and shook his head, but he didn't get up from the ground where he was sitting, leaning to the back instead. "Trust me if Taisuke wanted to kill you then you'd be dead, us most likely as well."</p><p>Unfortunately Taiga had guessed that already, but he didn't want to say it out loud.</p><p>"So you are the Fallen in control of his senses we heard about?" Another one of them asked, scanning Taiga from head to toe with an intense stare.</p><p>Taiga looked a bit worried towards Hokuto, but he also didn't know how they had gotten that information.</p><p>"Let me explain a bit before this gets too complicated," Shime offered and walked up to the other boys. He stopped next to the boy sitting on the ground and who had spoken up first. He had curly black hair, which was already so long that it was hard to see his eyes when he was sitting. “This is Nakamura Kaito. He is a Chaser from the South Center.” The boy just lifted his hand, not bothering with getting up and introducing himself. Not to forget that details had to wait for later. They had a dangerous enemy right in front of their doors and who knew if Taisuke wasn’t planning another attack already.</p><p>Shime stopped next to the boy who had spoken next and put his hand on his shoulder. The boy was the tallest of them all and he had a little bit longer straight black hair. “This is Kawashima Noel. He is the ace of the Chasers in the Main Center.”</p><p>“Now I would have loved to see him compete against Taiga when he was still a Chaser,” Shintaro whispered, but Noel just cracked a smile.</p><p>Shime kept going and pointed at a boy at his left who had red curly hair and a sheepish smile on his lips. “Matsukura Kaito, a Vestige from the Main Center.”</p><p>“Do you have any special abilities?” Juri asked, but the boy shook his head.</p><p>“Wait two of you are called Kaito? This is going to be confusing,” Jesse interfered.</p><p>“Then what would you do if I told you my name was also Kaito?” One of the other boys with slightly wavy black hair said with a teasing smile as he got up and bowed slightly to the others. “My name is Miyachika Kaito. I am a Chaser from the East Center.” </p><p>Shime walked up to him and patted his shoulder. “You can call him Chaka and the other two Matsuku and Umi.”</p><p>“I already have a headache,” Shintaro let out, but with so many new people it was normal that they needed some time to remember everyone in the first place.</p><p>“Our youngest member is Yoshizawa Shizuya, a Chaser from the North Center,” Shime added and pointed at the boy with short black hair and slightly chubby cheeks.</p><p>“And definitely the worst Chaser you have ever seen,” the last boy spoke making Shizu seem slightly embarrassed. “But he puts a lot of passion into his job.”</p><p>Now Shizu seemed even more embarrassed, but Shime pulled everyone’s attention back to the remaining boy. “This is Matsuda Genta from the North Center and he is a Vestige. He is the strongest Vestige in our team.”</p><p>“Is he stronger than Myuto?” Taiga asked and the boy with the dark gray hair nodded.</p><p>“My special ability is to be able to attack with ten times my strength, but of course I need a long recharge time and it only works for a few seconds. I can hold someone down or put enough strength into my grip to even crush bones, but of course Taisuke stays unaffected even by that ability.”</p><p> “Wait, you are all from different Centers, some of you Vestige, others Chasers. What is your connection?” Shintaro asked and then pointed at Chaka. “And why weren’t you at the East Center attack right from the start?”</p><p>The boys all exchanged a troubled expression for a moment before it was Taiga who caught up to the situation first. “You are all connected to Taisuke.”</p><p>“More or less, yes,” Shime explained. “The same as Myuto, Taisuke gathered other Fallen around him, but he didn’t do so to rescue them from the Government. All he wanted was to gather the most skilled Fallen to be able to eventually strike back at the Capitol.”</p><p>“So the Fallen he gathered are connected to the other boys,” Juri said. “Well those details can wait for later I think. For now we need as much information about Taisuke and the other Fallen as we can get.”</p><p>“All of us stood in contact all this time,” Shime started. “We only clashed once with Taisuke and the others, since then they had retreated so far away from the city that we couldn’t find them anymore. When the attack at the East Center happened, Chaka was out with a few Chasers and two Vestige. So luckily he was able to contact us.”</p><p>“That’s why you all came as backup,” Hokuto concluded.</p><p>“You guys gave Taisuke a tough challenge. But you have to think again if you really want to join us against them,” Genta said. “Taisuke likes playing around, but we all had trouble with just him, now imagine him coming with the others.”</p><p>“By then we will luckily have three more Fallen on our side,” Juri said, but he still seemed skeptical as well after all even Myuto and Kentaro hadn’t stood a chance.</p><p>“Taisuke will be a threat to all Centers from now on, so there is no way we will stay back,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“I am really glad to hear that,” Shime said and walked up to Taiga and Hokuto. “I have another request if you are both okay with it.”</p><p>The two boys exchanged a look and nodded before Shime stepped even closer. “To make things easier could you read my mind and show the information to all the other members? Like that we will speed up the explanation part a lot.”</p><p>Shime had a good point there and Hokuto moved first putting his hand on the boy’s temple, before Taiga moved his hand to the other side of the boy’s head.</p><p>“Please don’t hold back. I won’t keep any secrets from you.”</p><p>How much had the boy suffered until now through his brother being a Fallen? Taiga had suffered a lot after finding Myuto as a Fallen and here Shime was a Vestige and still couldn’t get close to his brother as he had turned out to be the strongest Fallen they had ever encountered.</p><p>Hokuto wouldn’t be able to share the memories he would receive, yet he could at least receive them directly so Taiga didn’t need to waste time with transferring them to him and as soon as Myuto was awake again he could help as well.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - October</strong>
</p><p>“What do you mean you want to take part in the trial?” Shime asked perplexed, but Taisuke already put his clothes in his bag.</p><p>“What else can I do? We have been losing this war for years now. Daily I see people die. People who have nothing to do with this, friends who fight right next to me. Don’t you want this to end?”</p><p>Of course Shime wanted the war to end, but he also didn’t want to lose his brother. Every single day he left on another mission from the Government he worried sick until he finally walked back through the door. As a family of soldiers, their father had died in the war already and their mum had also lost her life as a nurse on the front line. But while Shime was only helping out inside the bases, Taisuke was on the front line. A pilot, away from him for weeks sometimes and while they had already said that resources got tight and they would soon not be able to fly over the border anymore, that day had not arrived yet. And the thought of him never coming back from one of those missions made Shime emotionally unstable and sometimes he couldn’t even get up in the morning without getting a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I promise to update you as often as I can, okay?” Taisuke said as he walked up to his little brother and put his hand on his cheek with one of his bright smiles. A smile he didn’t see often anymore as the sorrow of the loss of their parents and the ongoing stress of the war was now mainly seen in his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“You know that I will storm the facility if I don’t hear back!” Shime teased and Taisuke placed a kiss on the boy’s hair.</p><p>“Then I guess I have to make sure that you won’t get expelled for that.”</p><p>“Then don’t break your promise,” Shime whispered as he hugged his brother. The last hug he would ever give him…</p><p>The next time he saw his brother was a whole year later and there was absolutely nothing left of that smile he had wished to see again. But Shime had changed as well. A change which he had seen necessary to be able to even get close to his brother. As expected the promised contact had never come and soon after the disappearance of his brother the news of the Fallen had leaked. Shime had immediately known that his brother must have been among those Fallen or he would have come back to him. Unable to get anyone to help him, he tried for months to find Taisuke, but the Government started to hunt them and force them further away from the city. A civil war against the Fallen had started. First Shime had become a Chaser so that he could try and find Taisuke that way. But he soon realized that he wasn’t in any way suited to fight. At least not as a human. So as the Government suddenly established a new experiment and started sending out Vestige to the Centers against the Fallen he volunteered to become one of them.</p><p>On the same day as he had decided to become a Vestige he had met Matsuku who had made the same decision out of almost the same reasons.</p><p>Just two months after his transition Taisuke showed himself again, this time with a group of six followers. He hadn’t come to take the Main Center down, at least not yet. Maybe he wasn’t sure how strong he was himself at that time, but they could all only be grateful that he retreated or they would have all ended up dead.</p><p>Shime tried to stop his brother from running and now he was finally able to at least catch up with him, not that his strength was enough to stop him.</p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Taisuke’s question wasn’t as ridiculous as it should have sounded. What if he joined them? What if a Vestige went with the Fallen? Maybe he could find a better solution for all of them if he knew more about them?</p><p>“Won’t you come back with me instead?” Shime asked, trying to not sound too desperate. Yet the cold smile his brother showed made him tear up. How could he smile and yet be so emotionless? How could the touch on his face that followed, feel so meaningless.</p><p>“Oh, interesting. I can’t copy your special ability.”</p><p>“Maybe you just don’t want to,” Shime said, but what was he saying? His brother was a Fallen. There was nothing stopping him if he wanted to kill his own little brother now.</p><p>“I fear you won’t be of any use to us,” Taisuke said before he walked away from Shime, but once more he reached out for his older brother. What he didn’t expect was Taisuke turning and moving his hand to the boy’s chest. A common shockwave was what should usually hit him as in training Matsuku’s shockwave had hit him several times as well. But nothing happened and Taisuke lifted an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>“Interesting. Maybe you should join us after all. We could do a lot of research together.”</p><p>Shime shook his head and stepped back, not even having the mindset of using his immunity against Taisuke’s ability to attack his brother. “I wish I would have stopped you that day.”</p><p>“Oh boy, then I would be one of so many dead soldiers by now.”</p><p>“I might prefer that,” Shime let out, not even knowing how such cruel words left his mouth.</p><p>Taisuke seemed to get angry at his words, but before he could do anything, there were sirens heard from the Main Center and a lot of backup was on their way.</p><p>“Then maybe this should remain our last encounter. But be prepared, if you stay with the Government I won’t show you any mercy next time.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>“I remember that attack on the Main Center,” Kochi said after Taiga had come to the lab to show Kochi and Aran what Shime had shown him and Hokuto. He wasn’t able to go through all his memories at once and there were so many linked memories with the other boys that he needed to concentrate on the important parts for now.</p><p>“They told the other Centers to be on backup in case things escalate. They never gave us details about the Fallen who attacked though. But knowing that they had only shown up to scare the Government and make clear that they would be back with a real attack I wonder what the Main Center was thinking? The loss of so many lives at the East Center could have easily been prevented.”</p><p>“I wonder what would have happened if Myuto’s group had challenged Taisuke on their first encounter,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded.</p><p>“Most likely we would have all ended up dead,” Myuto was heard from the open lab door and Aran stood up, hurrying over to him.</p><p>“Are you alright? How are you feeling?”</p><p>“All good. I heard from Reo about Shime and the others. At least the summary.”</p><p>“I can give you the rest of the details,” Taiga offered and Myuto nodded before he lowered his hand from Aran’s cheek to take his hand and squeeze it.</p><p>“You should take a rest. I know you are worried, but you can’t lock yourself in the lab for days.”</p><p>“Could you stay out of my mind?” Aran teased, but of course he knew that the other one was worried and he definitely needed some sleep after they researched on the Reverse serum for this long. “Is Kentaro still asleep?”</p><p>Myuto nodded, but he wasn’t that worried. “Let’s talk to Yuma and the others for now.”</p><p>Aran nodded and left the lab first.</p><p>Myuto turned to Taiga after Aran had left. “You mind?”</p><p>Taiga nodded and stretched out his hand towards Myuto’s face. One part of Shime’s memory that surprised Myuto the same way as Taiga was that Taisuke seemed to completely remember everything from his life as a human. Was he that strong that he could easily deal with his past without his instincts trying to shut them out? For now they wouldn’t get to know.</p><p> It was so much faster to put memories into someone’s mind than talking things through, but Taiga still didn’t want to use this ability too much. It felt like there was still a lot about his own abilities he didn’t know. He felt that his abilities were the same as Myuto’s and if he wanted to he could actually block people’s memories and maybe even alter them, so that they would end up like Aran before. Something he never wanted to even try out.</p><p>***</p><p>“I wish I could take all the stress out of your mind.”</p><p>Hokuto’s words made Taiga turn to the boy who was lying with his back against the backrest with a few pillows behind his back, while Taiga had just sat down with an obvious way too loud sigh.</p><p>“Maybe Myuto could if I ask him?”</p><p>“But I doubt you would?”</p><p>And Hokuto was right, after all their abilities weren’t there to take away headaches or stress. But Taiga couldn’t deny that he felt extremely exhausted after this one day already and there was going to be a lot of chaos waiting for them that was for sure.</p><p>“Do you want to look further into Shime’s memories tomorrow?”</p><p>Taiga shook his head and crawled more onto the bed, resting his head on the other one’s chest as Hokuto invitingly stretched out his arm and played with Taiga’s hair now that he had settled down.</p><p>“I think tomorrow we should leave them all alone for a bit. Kentaro went straight to Yuma and the others when he woke up without even speaking to them and with Aran preparing the serum for them in the morning I think there will be enough chaos.”</p><p>“It fascinates me how they still follow Myuto even though his mind set is now so different,” Hokuto let out, his look absentmindedly on Taiga’s face.</p><p>“He is still as strong as before and they could have easily run over to Taisuke if they thought he was a more fitting leader.”</p><p>“Luckily that will be one less thing to worry about from tomorrow,” Hokuto said relieved and Taiga reached out for the other one’s hand and turned more on his back while he caressed the back of Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>“When you still had to deal with your Fallen self, did you ever feel how he was looking for a strong leader too?”</p><p>“You mean because he wanted to run over to Myuto?”</p><p>Taiga nodded while Hokuto’s hand stopped its movement in Taiga’s hair before he put on a thoughtful expression. “I never really felt his emotions in that way, so I am not sure if he was really looking for leadership or if he just wanted to break free from me.”</p><p>Taiga only nodded once more while both his hands were now putting a bit pressure on Hokuto’s hand and the boy raised an eyebrow at him. “Why did you want to know about this?”</p><p>“Mh? Oh, no specific reason. I think I am just worried that someone could still run over to Taisuke.”</p><p>“Like who? You?”</p><p>Taiga should laugh now, right? Yet he didn’t and Hokuto shifted a bit to be able to look at the other one more directly, but Taiga looked up at him and bit his lip. “That’s a joke, right? You got a serum, which should have actually turned you into a Vestige and just through my Fallen self you got his abilities. Your mind set is in no way the same as a Fallen.”</p><p>“Yet I am a Fallen, Kochi said so too.”</p><p>“And Myuto and the others are also still Fallen and they would never follow Taisuke. They almost died together with us fighting him. Is there something you aren’t telling me?”</p><p>Of course Hokuto would easily catch up with the situation and Taiga finally got up and sat down next to Hokuto, letting his head drop on the other one’s shoulder and luckily the younger one didn’t pull away. “I know I might just be overreacting, because I am so stressed and honestly quite scared about what Taisuke could do to our Center and the Government if he attacks with the Fallen following him.”</p><p>“But?” Hokuto asked, knowing that Taiga would never just start such a serious topic without any good reason.</p><p>“So much unused potential.”</p><p>Taiga’s words made Hokuto raise an eyebrow, but before he could shift away, Taiga hooked his arm with the other one. “Taisuke said that to me when he read my mind.”</p><p>“So what? You think there is still something going on in your mind? Don’t you think Kochi would have realized that by now? Even I couldn't find anything.”</p><p>“It does sound like I am overreacting, right?”</p><p>“It sounds damn scary,” Hokuto said to Taiga’s surprise and with the next move Hokuto placed a kiss on the other one’s hair and pulled him closer. “As long as you don’t hide anything from me or Kochi, I think you should be good? My Fallen self was able to communicate with me, so in case you ever feel like something is going on in your mind we can always run tests, you know? No matter how much our tests proved that you should be perfectly fine.”</p><p>Taiga was grateful that the other one didn’t make fun out of him over such a ridiculous worry, after all he wasn’t hiding anything. But his own weird reaction towards Taisuke on their first encounter and Taisuke’s words somehow made him worry that he wasn’t hiding something, but that something was hiding from him.</p>

  <p>Moro, a Fallen that can take away all basic abilities of a Vestige or Fallen through a simple touch, yet his past was marked with blood. His own blood. Always cheerful and showing a smile to his two little cousins he grew up with, after losing his own parents in an attack, when he was still a baby. Yet the war took away the rest of his family as well. Unable to cope with his loss he tried to take his own life. Becoming a Fallen hadn’t been his choice, but now he got a second chance to show his cheerful smile once more.</p><p>Hagi, soundwaves that would paralyze his opponents and take away their ability to find their balance, yet he had always helped children rebalance their lives after losing their loved ones. Until one day he lost them all in an air raid. Losing the ability to believe in human kindness he decided to become stronger to protect those who couldn’t do so themselves. Now he was finally given the chance to do so.</p><p>Yuma, with the ability of overpowering almost everyone with his shockwaves, he possessed the ability to end fights in an instant. Yet he hated fighting, hated violence and wished for nothing more than the end of the war. Unable to remain at the sideline he put his morals aside to fight for the sake of peace. A peaceful era, which he could now help create.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising to Taiga that after the third person he was unable to get up by himself and Hokuto stepped on the platform in the lab to help Taiga get up.</p><p>“I told you to take breaks in between,” Hokuto scolded him.</p><p>Taiga took his hand with a sheepish nod, but then he formed a smile when he looked at the others. “I think it was worth the hurry.”</p><p>All three remaining Fallen had finally received the serum and Aran had also somehow managed to make it at least a bit less painful so that they wouldn’t faint easily anymore, yet Taiga had still offered to help them through it and they had all agreed.</p><p>“Their smiles are beautiful,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded as he watched how Myuto hugged every single one of them. They were all a bit shaken through all the memories Taiga had woken up again, but they were all smiling. There was so much gratitude and hope shining in their eyes now and Taiga wished they could just forget about Taisuke threatening everyone’s new found happiness.</p><p>“Let’s give them a moment,” Hokuto said and left the lab together with Taiga and stopped at the training room where Juri was training with the others to see how skilled they were.</p><p>Hokuto pulled Taiga out of the way right before Umi landed next to them. The others in the room were only the Chasers of their group, so they seemed to have some trouble with Juri even with four against one, but Taiga could understand that as he had faced Vestige and Fallen as a Chaser often enough.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Taiga asked when the boy was up again and rubbed the back of his head.</p><p>“All good, only my ego is hurt.”</p><p>“To get such a big ego you should train harder,” Noel scolded him when Juri told them to take a break.</p><p>“Well there can only be one ace after all,” Chaka laughed, but the truth was that if he concentrated a bit more he could also become a quite good Chaser, but he was too chaotic for that.</p><p>“Never let him enter a battle in the same team as Shintaro,” Hokuto said towards Noel who didn’t know much about their Chasers yet, but he gave him a teasing smile obviously understanding that it would be a chaotic choice.</p><p>“Who is the strongest Chaser in your Center?” Shizu asked and Juri pointed at Taiga. “Until he got turned it was Taiga.”</p><p>“Really?” Umi asked, a bit disbelieving. “And here I thought you were as bad as Shizu and that is why you turned.”</p><p>“Let’s say I had a good reason to get stronger,” Taiga said and gave Hokuto a side-glance.</p><p>“Oh, I see, no more questions,” Noel said, getting the hint while Chaka raised an eyebrow at them.</p><p>“What do you see? I don’t get it.”</p><p>“Ask Hokuto I bet he will definitely explain the details to you,” Juri said with a teasing smile towards his friend before he left the training room to meet with Shime and the other Vestige.</p><p>Chaka turned to the one in question, but before he could even voice out anything, Hokuto pointed at him. “I swear I’ll make you regret any question, so zip it!”</p><p>Chaka got the threat faster than the hint so he pressed his lips together and hid a bit behind Shizu.</p><p>“So I think we are done for today then?” Umi said and already headed out to the corridor, when he stopped. “Oh, one of the Fallen is here. What was his name, Kentaro?”</p><p>Taiga turned towards the corridor and he was surprised to find Kentaro alone as he had been with Reo, Myuto and the others in the lab until a few moments ago. After he had finally woken up again he had only met with the other Fallen and had been to the lab, so he hadn’t gotten the time to talk directly to the boys who helped them out. But something on his face made Taiga tense as he didn’t seem in talking mood.</p><p>“Out of my way,” Kentaro hissed and Umi almost jumped out of the way.</p><p>“Didn’t you say he got the serum already?” Noel asked, but Hokuto could only shrug his shoulders.</p><p>“It helps with bringing them back to their senses, but they won’t change their personality.”</p><p>“So no taking Kentaro lightly it is then,” Noel said as he was able to analyze him already.</p><p>“Where the fuck is he?” Kentaro growled, but Taiga could only lift an eyebrow at him and the others also didn’t know who he was talking about.</p><p>Noel looked at Umi, but he shook his head, then he turned to Shizu who shrugged his shoulders, but then he realized that Chaka had completely hidden behind him.</p><p>“Chaka, what are you doing?” Noel asked, but on that question Chaka gave him a scolding look and put his finger in front of his own lips.</p><p>“YOU!” Kentaro shouted and Shizu immediately stepped away from Chaka as he realized that he wasn’t the one in question.</p><p>“What is going on?” Taiga asked a bit panicked, but something told him that he shouldn’t interfere, for now.</p><p>“Wait, I can explain,” Chaka said as he started running backwards when Kentaro approached him with big steps.</p><p>“Have you ever met Kentaro?” Hokuto asked, but Noel shook his head. “Not as long as I know Chaka.”</p><p>With a gasp Chaka hit the wall of the training room now out of running space and he seemed so stressed out that Taiga was on high alert. He doubted that Kentaro would rip him to pieces no matter his anger, but he still wondered what was going on.</p><p>“Ken-chan, let me explain. Please…” Chaka begged, stretching out his arms, obviously more than afraid of what Kentaro could do.</p><p>“Ken-chan?” Taiga asked with a raised eyebrow. Chaka had seen Kentaro when they rescued them, yet he had stayed with everyone in the West Center so things couldn’t be that bad, could they?”</p><p>“There is no need to explain anything,” Kentaro said, his words more threatening than soothing and Chaka almost curled up on the ground when Kentaro grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>“Ehm, okay...now I don’t get anything anymore,” Umi whispered after the whole room had fallen silent the moment Kentaro had pulled Chaka into a hug.</p><p>“Do you put them on drugs or something with that serum?” Shizu whispered towards Hokuto and received a punch against the shoulder from Noel for that stupid comment.</p><p>Chaka didn’t react for a moment with his eyes still wide open in panic and his hands slightly shaking. “You don’t have to explain anything,” Kentaro repeated when he put one hand up to the latter’s back and squeezed him even more. “All I needed to know is that you are safe, you damn son of a bitch.”</p><p>That statement finally made Chaka tear up and hug the other one back, desperately clenching his hands into the back of the other one’s shirt. “I am so sorry for disappearing like that.”</p><p>“He is not his brother, is he?” Hokuto whispered towards Taiga, but he shook his head. He had seen his brother and he was older. But he also hadn’t seen all the memories of course, so most likely he was someone he had lost sight of in the war.</p><p>“Guys, do you want to let us be part of the celebration or not?” Noel asked after giving them a moment to calm down and Chaka hurried to wipe away some tears with his sleeve, before he squeezed Kentaro’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ken-chan and I have been friends since childhood. Our parents were neighbors,” Chaka explained.</p><p>“Then why did he storm in here as if he wanted to kill you?” Umi asked perplexed.</p><p>“Well, Ken-chan always scolded me when I was younger. I got into trouble a lot, often vanished without letting anyone know where I was going and one day…”</p><p>“One day this asshole just didn’t come back,” Kentaro finished for him.</p><p>“Could you stop insulting me?”</p><p>“Never, you moron,” Kentaro teased and ruffled through the other one’s hair.</p><p>“Well, I would be pissed and happy at the same time too if I suddenly found someone who had disappeared like this,” Noel said.</p><p>“Why did you disappear?” Shizu asked and Chaka looked quite embarrassed through the question.</p><p>“I was a way too carefree kid and I loved playing with Ken-chan, his sister and brother, but one day none of them were home and I randomly started searching for them. I know that was stupid, I was still too young and naive to realize how dangerous it was to wander around alone as a child. At some point I didn’t know the way home anymore and just stood there in between all the buildings for hours, waiting for someone to find me. A sudden air raid made everything even more chaotic and in the end I found myself in an orphanage as I had obviously lost consciousness. I tried to explain to them that I had a family and after a few days we were finally able to find my house, but…”</p><p>“But it was too late,” Kentaro said with a dark expression. “That air raid had hit our neighborhood. It killed your parents and my sister.”</p><p>“I thought all this time that you had died as well,” Chaka let out with new tears shining in his eyes. “But when I met your brother again I wondered if you had survived too.”</p><p>First that statement hung in the air for a moment until Kentaro looked up with wide eyes. “What did you just say?”</p><p>Now everyone’s attention was on Chaka who lifted a hand to his mouth as if he just realized that he had said something he shouldn’t have. Even Noel and the others didn’t seem to know.</p><p>“I- I know I need to explain this, but-”</p><p>“Then do. Chaka, where is he?” Kentaro asked and shook him on the shoulders, but Chaka seemed more than reluctant to reply. “Don’t you get how amazing this news is?”</p><p>Kentaro’s excitement wasn’t shared by Chaka and when Hokuto gave Taiga a worried side glance he felt a heavy stone sinking in his stomach. Taiga reached out for the other one’s face and in silence they confirmed what they were both thinking. He was alive, which was indeed good news, but maybe the rest wasn’t as exciting as Kentaro wished it to be…</p><p>“Do you know how happy I was when I saw your name on the list of new members in the lab earlier? I couldn’t believe that you were still alive and now you tell me that you even met my brother? Was he in your Center? Where is he now?”</p><p>Chaka kept looking to the floor, unable to reply, but his silence made Kentaro shake him even more until he finally had enough and grabbed the other one’s hands. “I can’t tell you.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Kentaro asked a bit more calmly this time.</p><p>“Can we talk about this later? I was so happy to find you with the others the other day. Do you know how happy I am that you are alive? Even though you had become a Fallen you got the chance to start over and this is amazing and just for now I want to be happy.”</p><p>His words made Kentaro take a few steps back and then he finally caught up with Chaka’s reaction, with his gloomy look and his attempts to change the topic.</p><p>“No, this can’t be…” Kentaro slowly shook his head.</p><p>Shizu tugged on Noel’s sleeve, but the older one lifted his hand, not wanting to give him any explanations now.</p><p>“He promised to come back on that day…” Kentaro whispered and for the first time there was such hurt visible on Kentaro’s face that Taiga wished he could take away his emotions to give him some peace of mind. “Nika...why…”</p><p>There were so many open questions, yet to their surprise Kentaro got a grip once more and clenched his hands until his fists were shaking and Chaka flinched when he looked up.</p><p>“Where is he now?”</p><p>It was obvious that Chaka didn’t have any other details about Nika, Kentaro’s older brother, but at least his whereabouts he knew. But alone that information could shatter Kentaro even more, yet it was clear that he wouldn’t let it pass in silence and finally Chaka took another deep breath.</p><p>“He is with Taisuke.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Kentaro, we can’t just go and look for him. We have no clue where he is,” Kochi tried to calm down the other one, but Kentaro didn’t even listen to him and only rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest as almost the whole Center had blocked his way.</p><p>After Chaka had told him that his older brother had ended up as a Fallen with Taisuke he had decided to go find him, but of course his idea had been cut short when Myuto got to hear about what had happened and made sure to drag him back into the training room before he could actually storm out of the Center all on his own.</p><p>“I am not a member of this Center, nor a puppet of the Government, I am grateful for your help with the serum and also for Chaka and the others helping out, but this is something I have to do alone.”</p><p>When he tried to get out of the room once more, the other Fallen blocked his way and Reo was the one to walk up to him. “After what we have done over all these years don’t you think you know the outcome already if you find him?”</p><p>“He is my brother,” Kentaro growled at him in annoyance.</p><p>“And Taisuke is Shime’s brother, yet he doesn’t storm out, knowing that it doesn’t make any sense to do so without a plan,” Myuto said while Shime and the others had gone a bit on distance, not wanting to interfere.</p><p>“Shime is no Fallen,” Kentaro countered.</p><p>“And yet Nika will just see you as the same enemy he sees in everyone else,” Taiga spoke up to everyone’s surprise. “Even after I became a Fallen, Myuto still tried to kill me.”</p><p>The truth of these words made Myuto’s look darken, but Kentaro didn’t want to listen.</p><p>“I am well aware of what will await me, but that won’t stop me from going,” Kentaro said and when Reo tried to put his hand on the other one’s shoulder he slashed it away with a warning look.</p><p>“Can’t you wait at least a few more days? We can come up with a plan where to look for them and how to approach them more carefully?” Juri interfered.</p><p>“I don’t need a plan and I don’t need you with me,” Kentaro hissed and passed Reo, but this time Myuto stepped in his way and before Kentaro could lift a hand the other one had pushed him to the back, making Kentaro growl at the other one.</p><p>“You are still part of my team though and I won’t allow you to go,” Myuto ordered, showing that he was as serious about stopping Kentaro as the other one was about leaving.</p><p>“Fine,” Kentaro said, suddenly forming a snappy smile as he turned away and stopped in the middle of the training room and spread his arms. “Then let’s settle this the old fashioned way.”</p><p>“What does he mean?” Shintaro whispered, while he and Jesse kept hiding a bit behind Taiga and Hokuto.</p><p>“You’ll see in a second,” Hokuto let out while he crossed his arms to his chest with a sigh. “Do you think we have to interfere?”</p><p>The question was for Taiga and he looked quite troubled and wasn’t sure if he wanted to nod or not, because the truth was that he could understand why Kentaro wanted to go and also why he tried to leave the others out of it. Kentaro wasn’t as egoistic as he wanted to make the others believe after all.</p><p>“Fine, if you think this is necessary,” Myuto said and stepped in front of Kentaro while the others slowly retreated to the side of the training room, knowing what was coming.</p><p>Between Fallen an argument would usually get settled through a fight and the serum wouldn’t change that kind of thinking for them.</p><p>“I won’t hold back,” Kentaro warned.</p><p>“You better don’t or you won’t have a single unbroken bone left to leave the Center for the next few days,” Myuto warned.</p><p>“I will walk out these gates no matter what,” Kentaro hissed before he dashed to the front, but Myuto hadn’t been bluffing and he lifted his hand, making Kentaro stop with a curse as he couldn’t move freely for a moment, but he was stronger than most of them had expect and Chaka bit his lip in worry as Kentaro screamed at his body to move and he was able to approach Myuto fast enough to make the other one go on distance. Myuto didn’t have to fear Kentaro’s shockwaves, yet his special ability was something that could make him lose.</p><p>“Don’t make me go all out on you,” Myuto warned, but Kentaro just gritted his teeth and sped up once more, breaking completely through Myuto’s motion control this time.</p><p>First Myuto tried to stay on distance until he could recharge, but Kentaro’s anger made it way easier for him to break through that ability so in the end Myuto dared to step into Kentaro’s reach.</p><p>The smaller one tried immediately to get his hands on the other one’s skin, but Myuto was faster than him and he grabbed Kentaro’s wrist and twisted his arm on his back before he reached out for his face. But the time it took for Myuto to try and control Kentaro’s mind, was enough for Kentaro to lift his free hand and reach out for Myuto’s hand. Before anything could happen, the taller one jumped away, leaving Kentaro laughing at him.</p><p>“If you want to stop me then you should use your pain infliction instead of your mind control. You won’t have enough time to get into my mind.”</p><p>“If you want to lose that fast then I can do you that favor,” Myuto said dead serious as he wasn’t happy about hurting a friend, yet he wouldn’t let him run out there into his own death.</p><p>Once more Kentaro took a run up at the other one, but knowing that he couldn’t use his shockwaves and with Myuto on high alert about his special ability, he went for kicks and punches instead.</p><p>But once more Myuto was still the faster one and he could use his shockwaves, so with the next attack Kentaro got thrown through the room and crashed into the wall with a gasp.</p><p>Everyone else remained on distance, not even Reo tried to argue with him. It was clear that he had to lose or he wouldn’t get stopped.</p><p>“Kentaro, you know that we will stop you know matter what,” Myuto reminded him. “Even if you somehow win against me, you need to go through them all to leave.”</p><p>“Then I will win against them as well,” Kentaro shouted after he got up again. “Why do you even care? I never asked any of you to go with me. Just leave me alone!”</p><p>“You know exactly that we would never do that,” Myuto said with a slightly hurt expression while Kentaro got ready for another attack.</p><p>This time Kentaro went all out, ready to put all his remaining energy in defeating Myuto, but his leader wasn’t going to lose just so he didn’t have to hurt his friend, so in the end Myuto went for the one attack he didn’t want to use as Kentaro kept fighting like a wild animal.</p><p>In between Kentaro’s shouting and punching, Myuto lifted his hand, making Kentaro slow down enough to stretch his hand out and grab the other one’s neck. Kentaro immediately reached out for Myuto’s wrists, but this time Myuto’s ability was faster than the other ones as he wasn’t going for mind control.</p><p>With a scream Kentaro went to his knees, but Myuto wouldn’t let go of him as he knew that he needed to make him surrender completely or he would just keep fighting.</p><p>To his surprise Kentaro was still strong enough to use his own ability and soon Myuto gasped on the pain in his chest, which would soon rip his blood system apart if he didn’t hurry.</p><p>“This is for your own good,” Myuto said as he went full out on the other one and in the middle of another scream the room fell silent as Kentaro fell to the back. Myuto was fast enough to move one hand around his back so he wouldn’t hit the ground and Reo hurried towards them and sat down next to Kentaro.</p><p>“Why won’t you just leave me alone,” Kentaro let out in a weak voice, not even opening his eyes, while Myuto got up with a judging look towards him.</p><p>“Because as much as you want us to believe that you want to go alone, because it’s your family problem, we won’t sit back and watch you getting killed, just because you want to keep us away from the fight.”</p><p>Of course Myuto had realized as well why Kentaro wanted to leave in such a hurry, but he wasn’t the only one who wanted to settle things with those Fallen following Taisuke.</p><p>“I know I can’t get him back,” Kentaro let out in an unsteady voice and it was Reo who looked ready to cry the next second. “I don’t want to go to get him back. I want to go to punch him in the face and yell at him for being so selfish and leaving me behind.”</p><p>“I know,” Myuto whispered, clenching his fists. “But how about you trust us instead?”</p><p>This time Kentaro finally opened his eyes, but didn’t get up. Myuto gave him a serious look before he let his eyes wander through the room. “All of these people here in this room have done so much for us and are still trying to help all the other Fallen out there. Chaka and the others have the same right as you to be angry, disappointed or sad about the Fallen following Taisuke, yet they didn’t give in to their emotions. Instead they are all here to help, so for once how about you put your trust in someone else?”</p><p>Not only as a Fallen was Kentaro a lone wolf, but he had been different before losing his family and turning into a Fallen, but it was hard to put his trust into someone, especially when the situation seemed hopeless.</p><p>When Myuto suddenly stepped aside, Kentaro looked up at Chaka who had slowly walked up to them and gave Kentaro an unsure look. “I know as a Chaser I can’t do much, but I trust these guys as much as you trust your leader and the other Fallen,” Chaka explained while looking over at Shime and the others. “I was shocked when I saw Nika as a Fallen. I wanted to take him by the collar and yell at him why he hadn’t protected his family. But it was Shime who taught me how important it was to think rationally and be patient, because you are wrong. You can get him back.”</p><p>Chaka’s direct words had everyone look at the boy, but it brought supporting looks instead of disbelief, because they knew that he was right. Kentaro was just too outraged to see the hope!</p><p>“We have the Reverse serum, we have Fallen on our side, a whole Center behind us and if you give us a bit of time and your trust we can definitely come up with a plan to get Taisuke, Nika and the others back on our side too.”</p><p>When Chaka stretched his arm out towards the older one, Kentaro hesitated for a moment and bit his lip, but when he looked up at Reo, the boy gave him a bright and supportive smile, while Myuto also seemed to have waited for him to finally see past his anger.</p><p>“Under one condition,” Kentaro said, making Chaka raise an eyebrow, but the next second Kentaro had reached out for his hand already and let the other one drag him back on his feet. “I will personally train you before we go out to look for him, because at the moment you would be the first one in this group to die out there.”</p><p>While Chaka pouted, the others in the back started laughing and Shizu hit Noel as he said that he would die with him. But in the end Chaka formed a smile and nodded.</p><p>“As long as you are not the one killing me at that training already.”</p><p>“I can’t promise that.”</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - January</strong>
</p><p>"Two more days," Aran announced.</p><p>"But didn't you just say you completed the upgrade for the Reverse serum for the use on the battlefield?" Hagi asked.</p><p>"Yes the serum is not the problem, but you need to train more on how to get close enough to them to even get a chance to use it," Kochi explained.</p><p>"Chaka is ready to beat the shit out of them," Kentaro announced proudly.</p><p>"I'd say Chaka looks like the shit was beaten out of him instead," Shintaro whispered towards Jesse who giggled, but zipped it when Kentaro gave them a dangerous look.</p><p>"Anyway, the system is easy," Aran explained as he lifted the metal tube in his hand. "All you have to do is bring it down on their skin for at least two seconds. There is no button to activate it as it automatically shoots the needle out when in contact with a Fallen. The system is similar to the first version of the Cricket. But be careful even though the canister is hard to break it’s not Dragnacit, so a Fallen will be able to destroy it."</p><p>"We should have just put it in a bullet and shoot them. Wouldn't that be safer?" Jesse asked and it wasn't a bad idea but it wasn't that easy either.</p><p>"We're too fast to easily get shot," Myuto explained. "And it would be a waste of serum."</p><p>"Will anything happen if the serum gets used against us?" Taiga asked, but Kochi shook his head.</p><p>"It's only attacking original Fallen DNA and we analyzed every possible outcome. Taiga, your DNA was different from the start so it wouldn't affect you at all, except your DNA would somehow change."</p><p>"But don't forget that for this first patrol all we want is to find their hideout," Juri reminded them. "Just if we get discovered and end up in a fight with them we will use the serum."</p><p>Kentaro didn't look too thrilled about that plan, but he had lost against Myuto so now he had to go with what they were planning. A whole week had already passed and he was getting restless.</p><p>"So we're training how to use the tube in the most effective way starting tomorrow?" Hokuto asked and Kochi nodded.</p><p>"Two days should be enough to get everyone's teamwork on a good level."</p><p>"Teamwork?" Reo asked a bit perplex.</p><p>"We'll head out in teams, so we will start training in exactly those teams."</p><p>Aran's words had them all a bit tense as it was obvious that they had thought the Fallen would go on their own, then Shime's team and then a West Center team.</p><p>"Well, the teams are definitely stronger when we combine a few strong abilities," Yuma agreed.</p><p>"Are you sending Chasers out too?" Moro asked, but it didn't seem like he felt offended by Kochi's nod. Usually Fallen wouldn't care to protect Chasers on the battlefield, but they understood that it was their fight too.</p><p>"Let's keep the details for tomorrow, okay? It's late you should all rest," Kochi suggested and they dismissed the meeting in the lab.</p><p>"Do you think we'll be on the same team?" Taiga asked on the way back to their room. Now that so many people were staying at their Center, Taiga had offered to move to Hokuto’s room for now so that his room could get used for others.</p><p>"You know the answer already, don't you?" Hokuto said with a gloomy look as he closed the room door behind them and went straight for the cupboard to change clothes.</p><p>"I'll take a shower," Taiga said and Hokuto couldn't blame him for being tense. Even with them only wanting to spot their location this mission was more than dangerous. They had to protect their own Center, be ready for other Fallen to attack while they were gone or in the worst case for Taisuke to be faster than them and attack them instead.</p><p>Remembering how badly they had lost against Taisuke, Taiga let out a sigh as he stepped under the hot water and put his forehead against the cold stone wall.</p><p>For days he just couldn't see a way to win and he wondered how the others could just keep going with their training like this.</p><p>After realizing after a while that his endlessly racing thoughts wouldn’t bring him anywhere and not wanting to waste precious water and keep Hokuto waiting for his turn he finally turned around, but that was the moment when he realized that he was indeed way too distracted. So distracted that he hadn't even realized the presence right behind him. Luckily for him it was no enemy, but the other one still attacked him.</p><p>Hokuto didn't say anything, instead he lifted his hand to Taiga's jawline and pushed his head a bit to the back, before he pressed him against the wall and gave him a rushed yet passionate kiss.</p><p>The running water didn't disturb them and Taiga's hands immediately reached out around the other one's hips, finding a lot of skin to grope on his way down.</p><p>"You want to switch to the bedroom?" Hokuto whispered against his lips, but all Taiga was capable of doing was shaking his head. This was exactly the type of distraction he needed and he needed it now!</p><p>Hokuto was luckily able to read the need in his eyes and their next kiss already mixed with moans while Hokuto used the advantage of the running water to prepare Taiga without even moving out of their position.</p><p>When Taiga bit the other one on the bottom lip, signaling his impatience, Hokuto lifted the other one up. Taiga closed his legs around the younger ones back and kept his arms hanging loose around his neck, while Hokuto pressed him more into the wall. For them it wasn't much of an effort to keep this position and Taiga would do it in whatever position for now.</p><p>"Hurry up," Taiga complained and clawed his fingers into the other one's shoulders as Hokuto did exactly what he was asked to do.</p><p>Their touches were impatient, Hokuto's thrusts so rough that Taiga ended up as a moaning mess way too soon and even though Hokuto wasn't able to help him out in this position he didn't care. This messed up situation was enough to make Taiga come on his own and he rested with his head against the wall, the water feeling like needles on his skin.</p><p>Hokuto let him down so that he could relax for a moment, but then he turned him around and Taiga was feeling still too weak on his legs to complain.</p><p>"If you go without me then you have to go again," Hokuto whispered next to his ear and bit in his earlobe when he pushed in from behind.</p><p>This time the sound Taiga let out was more of a whine as he wasn't yet completely down from his first climax.</p><p>Hokuto used that to his advantage though and closed his hand around Taiga, making the other one breathe in sharp on the way too sudden second stimulation.</p><p>"Come again for me," Hokuto whispered before he bit Taiga on the neck and the older one threw his head to the back, one hand reaching out for Hokuto's face. Even with the weird angle he still demanded s kiss and Hokuto was more than willing to give it to him. Once more he seemed busier with Taiga than with himself and Taiga had to pull back with a high pitched moan as Hokuto made him come once more. This time though Hokuto started thrusting more desperately, not giving Taiga the time to relax yet. Finally able to come as well, Hokuto put a hand to the wall to stabilize himself while taking a few erratic breaths.</p><p>Taiga used that moment to turn around and put his hands on the other one's chest before he gave him another passionate kiss, which made Hokuto feel way too aroused once more.</p><p>"Do you plan on keeping going for the whole night?" Hokuto asked with his own lips already back on the other one’s face, before he was even able to answer.</p><p>The way Taiga melted into the upcoming kiss and had his hands greedily over the other one's body, while Hokuto deepened the kiss until all he wanted was to take it further once more, it was clear that yes they would keep doing this for a while.</p><p>"From tomorrow on we'll be pretty busy and most likely not even training together, so yes I won't leave you alone tonight," Taiga said, his voice already sounding a bit husky.</p><p>"Then let's make sure we're not using the whole water while we do so," Hokuto said with a lopsided smile as he turned off the water and grabbed a towel, throwing it over the smaller one's head.</p><p>It was ridiculous how easily Taiga had thrown all his worries out of the window, but just for another night he wanted to pretend like they could go on like always!</p><p>***</p><p>"Okay so we will send out four teams and have one back up team here in the Center. We also will have some people remain in the Center in case other Centers are in trouble or if we get attacked," Kochi explained the next day when they all met in the training room.</p><p>Most of the West Center's Chasers had already decided to stay behind and take care of the Center and possible emergencies, but Jesse and Shintaro wanted to help out.</p><p>"Anyone who wants to stay behind voluntarily?"</p><p>Kochi's question had made them all look at each other until one Vestige stepped to the front. "My abilities are more useful here."</p><p>Juri's words made Kochi nod and he noted Juri's name down as backup.</p><p>"We don't want the worst case to happen, but in case a team needs help it's definitely a good idea to have you on it so you can help out with recharging their abilities."</p><p>"I'll stay behind with Juri," Noel announced. "My strength lies in analyzing so I can give advice to the teams from here."</p><p>"I'll stay here too," Shizu announced and while it was clear how much he would like to go out with one of the teams, he didn't want to be a burden. Not that they were trying to get into any head on fight this time.</p><p>"Okay so then we only need one more Fallen or Vestige who will stay at the Center for other emergencies."</p><p>"I'll do it."</p><p>To their surprise it was Yuma who volunteered.</p><p>"I'm a strong fighter, but as we're not aiming for a direct fight this time and the Center is our base, which needs to be protected as well, I will make sure everyone has a safe place to return to."</p><p>It was obvious how grateful Shime and the others who were directly involved with Taisuke, were for his choice.</p><p>"Okay then let's start forming the remaining teams so that you can start your training," Kochi announced. But it seemed like he had already decided the teams depending on who would stay behind.</p><p>"Every team will have a team leader. They will stay in contact with me and the others who stay behind."</p><p>"Means as much as don't dare to do something they didn't approve of," Kentaro said, knowing already that this was what they needed of course, but it also meant he wouldn't be a team leader, because he wasn't calm enough for that.</p><p>"Okay so the first team's leader is Myuto." Kochi announced.</p><p>That came to no one's surprise neither did the name he put under it on the board.</p><p>"Kentaro you have one of the strongest direct abilities and in combination with Myuto who can control from the distance, you're a strong team."</p><p>"And I can't run off doing something stupid," Kentaro added mockingly.</p><p>"The other two members on your team will be Matsuku and Chaka."</p><p>"Now I have to babysit?" Kentaro said, looking at Chaka, but to his surprise his friend went up to him and put his hand on his shoulder. "No, you're going to get babysitted."</p><p>While everyone else chuckled, Kentaro let out a dangerous growl on which Chaka went a bit on distance. But it was after all a good idea to have Chaka on the team to talk Kentaro back to his senses in case Myuto would be busy fighting and Matsuku could take a neutral spot in the team as long as he would react calmly if they met the Fallen he was looking for.</p><p>"Okay then the second team Leader is Hokuto."</p><p>Again no one was surprised, because as much as Hokuto could be stubborn he could also be calm and would definitely think before acting, at least as long as Taiga wasn't on his team.</p><p>"The other members on your team will be Hagiya, Shintaro and Jesse. Hagiya can keep the Fallen on distance and you two-"</p><p>Kochi turned to the two Chasers in question. "Are too chaotic to leave you with anyone other than Hokuto."</p><p>Shintaro pouted and got ready to complain, but one look from Hokuto made him shut up.</p><p>"Look, it’s already working," Juri let out with a chuckle.</p><p>"The third team leader is Genta," Kochi announced and put three more names down. "Reo you can help them get away whenever necessary. Moro can help in case they get into close range and I heard Umi is quite skilled with close combat."</p><p>"No one on the team complained, but Reo seemed a bit disappointed that he didn't get a leader role.</p><p>"The last team's leader is Aran," Kochi announced and this time all of them looked more than confused.</p><p>"You're going?" Myuto asked, obviously not having talked about this with Aran.</p><p>"If I had told you, then you would have complained, right?"</p><p>"I still complain now," Myuto let out, but Kochi asked them all to calm down again.</p><p>"He'll be with Shime and Taiga so he'll be fine."</p><p>"And he is a really good strategist and knows how to fight Fallen the best, right?" Juri added and slowly Myuto calmed down, but the same as with Taiga and Hokuto it was definitely a good choice to not have him together with Aran on the same team.</p><p>"Okay, then the teams are set. You have two days to get a good teamwork and then we head out," Kochi explained.</p><p>It took a moment for everyone to split up in their groups and Shime approached Taiga with a careful look.</p><p>"I'm sorry that we put so much pressure on you."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Aran is the leader and I don't doubt that he is a skilled fighter, but we are only a team of three and while I can heal and am immune against Taisuke's abilities, I feel like if we get into a fight, you'll have to do most of it."</p><p>Realizing that, Taiga felt a bit nauseous, but he could only hope that they didn't have to go for a frontal attack. After all he wasn't confident at all that he could win against any of those new Fallen, especially not Taisuke.</p><p>***</p><p>"Make sure to keep me updated, okay?" Kochi said as he handed the leaders an earpiece. "This new transmitter can't easily be seen by the enemy, yet it could get destroyed if you get a heavy impact to the head. I'll only contact the team leaders so that not all of you will get distracted, but in case I don't receive a reply I can contact those with the old wrist transmitters."</p><p>They all made sure to set the new transmitter up, but different to a normal earpiece it would automatically put itself deeper into the ear so that it couldn’t easily fall out. Taiga also got one of the new types as Kochi had one spare one and if he really needed to fight than it was better than a wrist transmitter.</p><p>"Remember that this could take days, but as soon as anything goes out of hand we will call you all back," Juri reminded them.</p><p>"Will you be okay?" Hokuto whispered next to Taiga who couldn't really nod.</p><p>"As okay as everyone else as long as we don't run into trouble and at least we both still have our chips implanted in our arms from Kochi, so in a worst case scenario our locations can always be tracked."</p><p>“Right,” Hokuto said and put his hand to the back of his neck. The Vestige microchip he had gotten from the government wasn’t a tracking device, yet it was still a dangerous weapon. For him the chip had never worked through his Fallen self, but for the other Vestige it was different. Kochi was still keeping everything they were doing a secret from the Main Center, but would they get punished if they found out?</p><p>The gates of the Center got opened and the security fence would get opened after Kochi and the others had retreated back inside, so Taiga turned back to Juri and Kochi once more. "In case something is going on here, definitely let us know, okay? We can come back at any time."</p><p>"If you worry about us or other teams you will lose your focus. We'll be fine," Juri said with a supportive smile, yet Taiga still felt anxious about them splitting up. Even almost all of them together hadn't been enough to beat Taisuke.</p><p>"I warn you, if anyone cries I'll throw up," Kentaro yelled over to them and finally Taiga was able to show a smile as well, even though it didn't last long. He walked over to Hokuto who immediately stretched out his hand to the back of his head and pulled him closer to place a kiss on his forehead.</p><p>"We'll all come back here. Just stay focused, okay?"</p><p>"You too, don't let them annoy you too much," Taiga joked looking at Jesse and Shintaro.</p><p>***</p><p>“Shouldn’t we try and find shelter for the night?”</p><p>Chaka’s question made Kentaro stop and then his look changed. “Right, you need sleep.”</p><p>“Thanks for remembering my presence,” Chaka said a bit pouting.</p><p>“Did you ever think about becoming a Vestige? A lot of your friends are Vestige too.”</p><p>Kentaro’s question made Chaka look at Matsuku who walked in front with Myuto, but then he shook his head.</p><p>“I know that as a Vestige I would be a lot stronger, but I don’t trust the Government enough and with all the stuff I heard about the microchips they implant I just never felt like doing it.”</p><p>“Might be the better choice,” Kentaro let out with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>When Chaka didn’t ask directly, but waited for Kentaro to reply, the smaller one turned and nodded. But Chaka looked quite troubled about his own question.</p><p>“I know we only met recently again after this long time and didn’t have much time to catch up, but what happened back then?”</p><p>Kentaro remained silent for a while until Myuto shouted over to them that they found a hut, but would check it out first and they should wait for them.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.”</p><p>As always Chaka was so thoughtful and Kentaro formed a brief smile. “It all started the day you went missing as well. Nika went out in the snow storm to get provisions, but when he didn’t come back until the next morning I decided to look for him, but of course I couldn’t leave my sister at home, so we went together.”</p><p>“That was when I didn’t find anyone at your house after the snow storm and went out looking for you.”</p><p>“As expected I couldn’t find Nika at the usual spots from where we got supplies so I took my sister back home and went around the neighborhood to ask if anyone had seen Nika. That was when I heard that you have gone missing since the morning.”</p><p>Chaka still felt a bit stupid for that, but he had been a child, not really thinking about any consequences.</p><p>“The air raid happened that afternoon and I tried to make it back to our house, but...I was too late.”</p><p>Another heavy silence followed, but Kentaro wasn’t the type who wanted hugs or comfort so Chaka just waited.</p><p>“I didn’t want to give up, knowing that Nika must have been out there somewhere at that time. Well, now I know that I had been closer than I thought I was, because after I couldn’t find any clues at all, I started spying around the Government buildings and of course that didn’t pass unnoticed and some soldiers tried to catch me, but I got away. Not for long though. They definitely thought I had found something out about their secret Fallen research and in the end I ended up the same. If I had known that Nika had been in the same mess...maybe I could have saved us both…”</p><p>“Or you would be with Taisuke now as well,” Chaka said, knowing that the chances for that outcome were huge.</p><p>Matsuku came back to let them know that they had found a place to stay the night so they walked up to the hut and Chaka dared to put his hand on Kentaro’s shoulder to squeeze it a bit. “You know that no matter what happens from now on, I will fight alongside you to get him back.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Can you stop looking at my food like this?” Umi scolded Reo as he sat way too close to him, while he was eating. “You don’t even need food and I won’t share with you.”</p><p>“Just because I don’t need it, doesn’t mean I don’t like it. And your food looks good,” Reo let out a bit pouting, but finally fell back against the tree next to him.</p><p>They hadn’t found any place close by to rest for the night, but Reo had made sure to use his illusions as much as possible to hide the fire place from their surroundings.</p><p>“If you were still human, you would be round and fat,” Moro scolded his friend, on which Reo kicked him against the leg.</p><p>“We won’t find that out luckily,” Reo said and stuck out his tongue towards the other one.</p><p>“It’s so hard to believe that you two are Fallen,” Umi said and bit his lip when both looked at him. “I don’t mean that in a bad way.”</p><p>Moro laughed at the sudden fear in the other one’s voice. “Be happy that Aran and Kochi got that serum, otherwise we would most likely be on Taisuke’s side now and give you an even harder time.”</p><p>“And we gave the West Center a tough time already. Kentaro and I almost killed Taiga on his first day as a Chaser.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Umi asked, more interested in that story than scared about it, because Taiga and the others were fine now and they had forgiven the Fallen for the things they did while they couldn’t actually think straight.</p><p>“Well, Hokuto was actually the one who almost killed him.”</p><p>“Right, he was half Fallen as well, if we heard that right?” Genta finally entered the conversation.</p><p>“Something like that, yes. He was supposed to become a Vestige, but the research was still shitty at that time and he ended up with a Fallen personality, which had a sadistic way of throwing Taiga and Hokuto into trouble until in the end he actually sacrificed himself to rescue Taiga.”</p><p>“Damn, that sounds so romantic,” Umi said and Genta threw a small stone at him, making the other one pout.</p><p>“Why did you decide to become a Vestige?” Moro asked and Genta sat back with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>“I wasn’t a fighter at all before I became a Vestige. I was in a research team and I had a senpai, his name was Mitsu. Things got dangerous at some point when Mitsu got part of some special research, but he wanted to get out as he didn’t agree with the Government. He also had a little brother he wanted to take care off, so when it got clear that he wouldn’t easily get out of his position he tried really hard to keep me out of that research.”</p><p>“The Fallen research,” Moro concluded.</p><p>“He made sure that I got transferred in a hurry and he wouldn’t let me know anything at all. Now I know that he did so to protect me, but I found out that he had become a Fallen through a footage I shouldn’t have had access to. I wished I knew more about his background, because I couldn’t even contact his brother about it.”</p><p>“But you are sneaky and know your way around the research Center’s backdoors,” Reo said with a lopsided smile. He liked how Genta had been so serious about finding out the truth and hadn’t been running away at that time, even though it would have been the better choice maybe.</p><p>“I knew that alone I wouldn’t be able to help him and I never wanted to see the Fallen as our enemies, because we caused their misery ourselves, so we should help them as well.”</p><p>“So you decided to become a Vestige to help him,” Moro concluded with a kind of proud look.</p><p>“And you didn’t want to become a Vestige?” Reo asked Umi who seemed troubled finding a reply.</p><p>“He tried,” Genta replied. “Right after my transition I was about to go to the North Center when I met Umi at the Main Center and he requested to become a Vestige.”</p><p>“But?” Reo asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“I have a rare health condition, which doesn’t really bother me in my daily life except if I fight for too long, but it would have been life threatening to turn me, as my cells wouldn’t have been able to make the transition.”</p><p>Umi’s explanation made sense, but it was still hard to imagine that there were indeed limits to their DNA manipulation.</p><p>“I had been traveling around the country, trying to stay out of the Capitol and I met a soldier who had been traveling as well, to help the people in more rural areas to get supplies and updates. Senga was such a great person. He was always smiling and trying to cheer everyone up. But one day I lost sight of him when we went to the Capitol and he was called to one of the military bases. It was when I met Genta that he helped me find out where he had ended up and the same as with Mitsu we found files about him. Because he had kept a low profile out of the Capitol they chose him, because they thought no one would realize it if he was suddenly gone.”</p><p>“So now you want to repay him for all the help he gave to you and the other people back then,” Moro said and Umi nodded with a nostalgic smile.</p><p>“It’s not his fault after all and with the serum we finally have a chance to actually rescue them instead of fighting them.”</p><p>“But after everything that happened I am not sure if there is a chance to rescue them,” Genta added.</p><p>“Now you sound like Taiga,” Reo said with a teasing expression.</p><p>“Better than sounding like Kentaro,” Moro added, making them all giggle a bit.</p><p>All they could do for now was trying. If Taiga hadn’t tried to convince Aran and Myuto to change, then they wouldn’t have gotten a second chance either, so they wouldn’t give up on the others without even trying.</p><p>***</p><p>“Are you sure that you don’t want to rest more?” Taiga asked a bit worried after Aran needed to be almost forced to sleep at some point, but Taiga remembered the best how tiring it could be as a human to keep up with Fallen and Vestige.</p><p>“The faster we cover our territory, the sooner we can go back,” Aran said as the sun had barely risen behind the huge mountains in the northern area. “Kochi, are you up?”</p><p>First Aran didn’t get any reply after he put his hand up to his ear, but no one was surprised that it was barely five in the morning, if even.</p><p>“Kochi is asleep, but I am in the lab. All good, why are you up so early?”</p><p>Shime and Taiga could hear Juri’s voice even like this and as expected their early departure the second day made them worry.</p><p>“All good, I just want to make sure that we are fast. How about the other teams?”</p><p>“They all rested for the night, but you are the first team we heard back from today,” Juri explained.</p><p>“Keep us updated if any team heads back before us,” Aran asked and Juri promised to inform them. They had a map and a given territory and they weren’t allowed to get out of it for safety reasons. If anything happened, the others could easily find them, knowing at least where to start the search. If they wouldn’t find anything this time, they would expand their search the next week after meeting at the West Center once more.</p><p>“You seem restless.”</p><p>Shime’s words made Taiga turn to him after he had kept scanning the mountain area. Like he did every single minute since the moment they had left the Center. So yes he was restless. Terrified was maybe the better word, but he didn’t want to make the others feel even more restless.</p><p>“Let’s go, if we are fast then we can cover enough territory today, to be able to get back tomorrow night,” Aran announced and started walking while Taiga stood still for another moment until Shime gave him a questioning look.</p><p>“Did you ever fight your own brother except for that one encounter?” Taiga asked, not even knowing why he asked such a stupid direct question, but Shime didn’t seem offended as he shook his head.</p><p>“The only time was when I met him as a Fallen for the first time and you have seen that memory. You can’t really call it a fight though. You’d be surprised though how much of a sweet and caring person he was before.”</p><p>“It’s always hard to tell the true character of a Fallen, but all I can see in Taisuke is a monster.” A few seconds passed in silence until Taiga looked up with wide eyes. “You know that I don’t mean that your brother is a monster. I am just- I don’t know…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Shime immediately soothed him and started walking so Aran wouldn’t have to wait for them. When Taiga caught up to him, he felt like he had said something more than offensive and he felt stupid for voicing out his worries towards the person who was closest to Taisuke.</p><p>“I am not hiding behind our happy memories,” Shime explained. “I want my loving brother back of course. I want him to do stupid jokes, to give me those sheepish smiles when he can’t hide a surprise and I want to be able to walk up to him, hug him and tell him welcome back.”</p><p>Shime’s words were as honest as Taigas, yet way more positive. “But I know that our chances are slim. I am not the only one who wants a family member or a friend back, but the cruel truth is that Taisuke has indeed become a monster. Of all Fallen I have ever encountered I have never seen a cruel behavior as the one of Taisuke.”</p><p>It hurt to have even Shime say those words out loud, but it made clear that he was living in reality, able to keep his emotions under control.</p><p>“But you have hope,” Taiga said with a faint smile. “I got Myuto back, now we have the serum and a lot of people who are more than willing to help out.”</p><p>Shime nodded with a thoughtful expression. After all it had been Taiga’s and Myuto’s story, which had made him put his hopes into the West Center and he couldn’t be more grateful for their help.</p><p>“We should go and help Aran, this area will be tough for him to climb,” Shime finally said after a moment of silence and when Taiga looked up he realized that they had made it to a steep area with no paths in front of them. So all they could do was climb and see what was lying between the high mountain peaks.</p>
