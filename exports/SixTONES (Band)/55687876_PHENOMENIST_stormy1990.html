The war which had started through the humans' never-ending greed and search for ultimate power had now turned into a war against their own.<br/>Phenomenists, the carriers of special abilities were hunted by those who feared their abilities and with the lack of knowledge and control, their goal soon changed from research to extinction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hey everyone^^/</p><p>I am finally back with a new work or more with a re-edited work. Some of you might have read parts of this several years ago. I wasn't satisfied with my writing and the story at that time so I deleted it and now it is ready to be completely posted as a re-edit! You might find similarities to my previous series (Battle of Evolution) as this work is the original idea for it</p><p>I didn't post any exact age for characters, but you will notice while reading that some of them are supposed to be still young adults/teenagers and have a way bigger age gap to other characters than in real life, I leave the ages to your imagination :)</p><p>Hope you enjoy reading and as always pls excuse grammar mistakes and plot holes. Enjoy~</p></blockquote>

</p><p>“I am sorry. I didn’t want to…” Kentaro let out between his sobs, but there was no time for apologies and Nikaido grabbed his little brother by the wrist and pulled him away before the people who had seen him could actually call the guards.</p><p>Years they had lived in the eastern city, as peaceful as it was possible in this post war time, but then Kentaro suddenly became one of them. One of those people which weren’t allowed in any city, but they couldn’t easily leave either. The country was destroyed, just a few major cities still somehow capable of keeping the order. Huge fences, which had at first been a defense over years of wars with other countries, were now surrounding them to keep the so called Phenomenists away from the cities. Helping a Phenomenist was forbidden and punished with death, but how could he leave his own brother behind?</p><p>For a few weeks they had managed, but Kentaro’s abilities were becoming too obvious, his emotions too hard to control and the heavy rain had made things even worse. Water was what he could control, one of the four existing abilities a Phenomenist could have and it wasn’t even clear yet if he also possessed others as well.</p><p>A routine control had escalated when soldiers had found Kentaro suspicious without even doing anything and they had threatened to bring him to the tower, the center of the city. Kentaro wanted to stop them, but without using his abilities he would have been no match and because he couldn’t control his abilities yet and his brother wasn’t around to help him, he was easily exposed when he tried to attack one of the soldiers, but it was a wave of water coming from one of the paddles of the ground hitting the person instead of a punch.</p><p>Nikaido had luckily reached them soon enough to prevent the worst from happening and he used the chaos to flee with Kentaro, but now they were in big trouble. The whole city was equipped with cameras, the next armed guard definitely not far away and while they wouldn’t see Nikaido as their enemy just like this, it would be different the moment all the soldiers around them got to know about his little brother being a Phenomenist.</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Kentaro sobbed as he got dragged along on which Nikaido’s grip on his wrist tightened.</p><p>“Stop apologizing. It’s not like you did something bad, they are the assholes,” Nikaido hissed and tried to somehow come up with an escape plan. The sounds of trucks passing by at the main road made him stop and pull Kentaro behind him. They were on their way out of the city to get supplies.</p><p>“That’s our chance,” Nikaido whispered and turned to his brother. “Whatever happens I want you to run in case they get me.”</p><p>“What? I will never leave you behind!”</p><p>“If they get you, they will kill you!”</p><p>“They will also kill you for helping me,” Kentaro said, shaking his head nonstop. When his tears started falling again the rain that had fallen the entire day already seemed to become even heavier.</p><p>Nikaido hurried to take his brother’s face into his hands and wipe away the tears, trying to sooth him. “Calm down, okay? It’s not like I want us to get separated, you know that! I don’t care if you have become a Phenomenist or not. But now we can’t stay anymore. We knew this day could come.”</p><p>Kentaro nodded immediately, because they were the last members of their family, the only ones who had survived the war. Kentaro had still been too young to even remember their parents, so Nikaido was his only family and he knew that his brother would never turn his back on him.</p><p>The sound of the gate opening made Nikaido turn back to the corner. “We have no time, let’s go. We can’t think about failing now!”</p><p>Kentaro tried to get a grip and concentrate as well as they dashed out of their hiding place, sneaking on the back of one of the empty supply trucks under the cover of the heavy rain.</p><p>“Get down,” Nikaido whispered and they hid behind the empty boxes while the trucks were driving out of the city.</p><p>On the faint sound of the gate closing again Nikaido finally relaxed and sat against the side of the truck.</p><p>“I guess we can relax for a bit now and as soon as we’re far enough, let's get off.”</p><p>When there was no reply Nikaido looked over to his brother who was lying on his back, but when he took a closer look, he realized that Kentaro had once more fainted. Using their abilities usually made Phenomenists feel exhausted and there were even rumors about them being at risk of heavier damage when they used their abilities too much so Nikaido wanted to make sure to become strong as well even without any abilities so that Kentaro didn’t have any reason to use them to a dangerous degree.</p><p>***</p><p>A nuclear war had turned the world upside down several years ago. New weapons, new chemicals, new miscalculations. Whole countries had been destroyed, population erased and then the humans themselves had started changing. A mutation as a lot of people called it at first, but it wasn’t that easy. Men were changing, women weren’t, the reason for that was the y chromosome which was attacked by a virus which circled over the whole planet after hundreds of different chemical and nuclear weapons had infested land and water.</p><p>The war which had started through the humans' never-ending greed and search for ultimate power had now turned into a war against their own. Those who had shown the mutations were taken to research centers at first, but soon the situation escalated as a lot of them couldn’t control their abilities at first.</p><p>The plan on research had been changed to a plan of extinction and at first it seemed like the mutation carrier, called Phenomenists by the researchers, were about to get extinct, but then suddenly new people became Phenomenists after months even years after the war and they realized that the mutation could still take place years later. Mainly children or young adults would suddenly turn or more like awaken their abilities, mostly after being triggered by a dangerous situation. Major cities started to force their citizens into regular DNA tests with which they could uncover the Phenomenists.</p><p>A lot of them had gone into hiding, afraid of getting found and killed, others had enough and attacked the people trying to kill them.</p><p>In the end humanity had been forced into two groups, the humans without mutations, called Infirm, hiding in their huge cities, surrounded by high fences and armed guards and the Phenomenists, hiding outside the danger zones, trying to form a new life on their own.</p><p>While everything had calmed down at first as the cities weren’t directly attacked by any Phenomenists, there was a new uproar inside their own fences now. Even years after separation between both groups, there were still people suddenly changing into Phenomenists. The cities’ guards would immediately execute those who showed any kind of mutation. With the fear of getting killed in their own city there were also those who decided to leave and live alongside the Phenomenists, but it was only a matter of time until one of both groups would start another uproar, but with the number of Phenomenists rising, another civil war could have a destructive outcome.</p><p>***</p><p>“Don’t walk that fast, we are not getting followed,” Nikaido said as Kentaro kept moving straight ahead through the forest even though they had no clue where they had ended up. At some point Nikaido had decided that it was better to get off the truck, but as expected there was nothing around.</p><p>“I just, I don’t know, it feels like this is a good direction.”</p><p>“A good direction for what?” Nikaido asked confused, on which Kentaro stopped and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“No clue actually, just a gut feeling?”</p><p>A pretty strong gut feeling that was for sure, because it was rare to see Kentaro that determined, especially after what had happened just hours before.</p><p>This behavior was definitely one Nikaido preferred though, so he just followed his little brother through the woods until he could hear a sound.</p><p>“A river?”</p><p>“Take a look at this,” Kentaro shouted, already out of Nikaido’s sight and the older one hurried towards him. A waterfall and fast flowing river were what awaited him at a small cliff where Kentaro was standing.</p><p>“Wow, that’s amazing,” Nikaido let out.</p><p>“Let’s take a rest here for now?” Kentaro asked and Nikaido nodded immediately. They had had no time to bring anything with them, so a place where they had fresh water which was not in any way chemically loaded like the city water, was definitely something they needed.</p><p>“We can go down here,” Kentaro said as he found a place where they could easily get down to the riverside.</p><p>Nikaido looked after his little brother with a thoughtful expression, but Kentaro was already running towards the water. This wasn’t just a gut feeling, that was for sure. Being able to sense the water from such a distance was definitely connected to his abilities and Nikaido could just hope that everything connected to them would stay this positive.</p><p>“Let’s try and make a fire, it's getting dark,” Nikaido said as he picked a bit of wood up on the way. At least it wasn’t raining out here in the woods, but it was definitely going to be quite cold at night.</p><p>“Would be awesome if we could somehow get some fish to eat,” Kentaro said as he stared at the river, seeing some trouts swimming by.</p><p>“Don’t you dare and step in there, the current is way too strong it will drag you along,” Nikaido warned him as he sat down on a bigger stone at the riverbank and tried to start a fire with what they had gathered. They hadn’t been able to gather any of their belongings on their way out of the city, so they had no provisions or anything else that could help them out here.</p><p>Kentaro kept staring at the river for the time being as if the river itself could give him a fish or two instead of him going in and trying to get it.</p><p>“At least something that worked out,” Nikaido said relieved as a few sparks finally made the dry wood catch fire. A squeal from his little brother made him look up right away, ready to scold him in case he had actually dared to go into the river. What he saw though was making him blink in confusion.</p><p>“Don’t ask me, I have no clue! It jumped into my arms I swear!” Kentaro defended himself as he held a huge trout, still trying to get out of his grip.</p><p>“So what, the river gave you the fish?” Nikaido teased him, but then he realized that it wasn’t as weird as it sounded at first. Kentaro’s abilities were connected to water after all. The city forbad it to learn about Phenomenists and their abilities so they didn’t know much, but what they had heard was that the abilities were becoming stronger or weaker depending on the emotional condition of the person and Kentaro was desperate for food, so maybe he had subconsciously moved the water to get the fish.</p><p>“Well now that you have it already let’s eat it,” Nikaido said, shrugging his shoulders, trying to play the confusion about all the weird happenings down, because he could already see that Kentaro was also overwhelmed with his own abilites.</p><p>As expected, it turned dark pretty soon and unfortunately, they had nothing but the fire to keep themselves warm and Nikaido sat down next to Kentaro.</p><p>“You need to sleep a bit, come lie down,” Nikaido said and clapped on his own thighs on which Kentaro shook his head.</p><p>“I am not so tired. You should sleep first.”</p><p>“I am the older brother, no complaints!”</p><p>Luckily that was a tactic that always worked and a bit reluctantly Kentaro finally tried to find a somehow comfortable position and put his head on his brother’s legs.</p><p>“Where do we go from here? Do you think they will try and find us?”</p><p>Kentaro had turned on the side, but Nikaido could read the worry in his voice and he put his hand on the boy’s hair. “They won’t try to come after us, don’t worry. They left the Phenomenists outside of the cities alone for now and just attacked those who dared to come close to the city. So as long as we don’t try to go back it’s going to be fine.”</p><p>If it eventually would be fine, he couldn’t tell of course, but as the older brother he wanted to make sure that Kentaro didn’t have to worry that much. “We might find some abandoned places to get supplies.”</p><p>As there was no reply at all, Nikaido leaned a bit to the front, smiling as he realized that Kentaro had already fallen asleep. “Not tired, right…” he whispered with a chuckle.</p><p>***</p><p>When the morning arrived Nikaido realized that he had fallen asleep at some point after all and what made him wake up even faster was the fact that Kentaro was not lying next to him. When he sat up and took a look around, he found the boy next to the river.</p><p>“What are you doing this early in the morning?” Nikaido asked as he walked up to his brother.</p><p>“I tried to get us another fish, but it won’t work.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it too much. You don’t even know how you did that or if it really was just a coincidence so let’s keep moving.”</p><p>Nikaido was totally understanding his little brother’s bad mood after not being able to control the abilities which he had been given without even wanting them, but maybe time would bring him answers or they were lucky and would meet other Phenomenists who could actually help him.</p><p>“So where shall we go?”</p><p>“Why do you ask me that?” Kentaro asked in confusion.</p><p>“Because your gut feeling brought us here, so maybe it can bring us to another good spot after this?”</p><p>It had been meant to be just a bit of teasing, but unfortunately Kentaro’s mood turned even worse. “I can’t even tell how my abilities work so it might be better to not trust me with this.”</p><p>Nikaido patted him on the shoulder before he chose a direction randomly to head off to. “Don’t worry there will be a day when you can make good use out of them.”</p><p>If Kentaro even wanted that was still unclear, but what else than trying to support him could Nikaido do? If he could he would take the powers away from him, but that was something he of course wasn’t capable of.</p><p>A second night had them left in the middle of the forest without food or water, but they kept walking through a thick forest the next day while they had to slow down as their surroundings got more and more steep, leading them into the mountains.</p><p>“If we go too high, I fear it will become even colder in the evenings,” Kentaro let out worried and Nikaido nodded.</p><p>“Let’s see if we can find somewhere alongside the mountain where it’s easy to walk.”</p><p>After a few more minutes in the thick forest, they suddenly reached an area where it got easier to walk and they scanned their surroundings.</p><p>“It almost looks like a path,” Kentaro said as two open areas were visible in front of them.</p><p>“Now the question is just which way do we go?” Nikaido asked while he had walked up to the area that lead up the mountain, but then he realized that Kentaro wasn’t even listening to him. He had already made a few steps onto the path ahead, looking concentrated into the forest.</p><p>“Kentaro?” Nikaido asked, but didn’t get a reply on which he stepped closer and waved his hand in front of the boy’s face. “Hey, everything okay?”</p><p>Kentaro flinched on the move as if he had totally forgotten that he wasn’t alone. “Sorry, I just, I don’t know, forget it…”</p><p>“You think we should go that way, right?” Nikaido analyzed his behavior and he knew he was right when Kentaro bit his lip.</p><p>“I know I said earlier we shouldn’t rely on this weird gut feeling ,but I really think we should go this way,” Kentaro explained, to which Nikaido gave him a smile.</p><p>“Then it’s decided, let’s go!”</p><p>It didn’t matter if they trusted Kentaro’s feeling or not, they just had two directions to choose from anyways.</p><p>The path got even clearer after a while, but the forest continued as before with the difference that they weren’t getting even more up into the mountains, but followed on the side of it.</p><p>“Do you hear that?” Nikaido asked and they both stopped, listening to the sound they could hear.</p><p>“I have a bad feeling about this,” Kentaro said, but kept walking, because what was awaiting them wasn’t dangerous, as long as they didn’t have to pass it, but luck didn’t seem on their side as they found a huge waterfall in front of them after a bit more of walking.</p><p>The waterfall was coming from the rocks right over the path and made it impossible to keep going as the water hit the path with full force and would make them fall and looking down the waterfall continued quite a long way.</p><p>“So are we turning around?” Nikaido asked a bit disappointed about the sudden dead end.</p><p>Kentaro walked a bit closer to the waterfall though, but there was no way around it. “Don’t you think this is strange?”</p><p>“Why?” Nikaido asked and stepped next to him.</p><p>“The path continued completely clearly until here and suddenly it stops like this? I doubt a lot of people would randomly walk up here and then turn around.”</p><p>“Maybe people live nearby and get their water from here?” Nikaido said, trying to find an explanation.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be easier to get the water down where the waterfall ends then instead of walking up here?”</p><p>“Also true,” Nikaido said defeated. “Anyways, let’s head back. It’s getting dark soon so we should find somewhere to rest close by so we have water for the night.”</p><p>Already looking around if he could spot a good place to try and make another fire, he didn’t realize that Kentaro wasn’t following him until he turned around. Looking back to the waterfall he realized that his brother had disappeared. “Kentaro?”</p><p>Not wanting to panic right away he tried to spot him in the forest, maybe he had tried to find a way around, but there was no sign of him on which Nikaido dashed back to the waterfall, panic rising fast now. Had he fallen? But he would have shouted out for him if he had lost his balance or slipped.</p><p>“Kentaro, where are you?” Nikaido shouted this time, but again no answer. When he was ready to actually turn and dash down back the path to see if Kentaro had actually really fallen, a movement on his side made him jolt and jump to the sight.</p><p>“What the actual fuck?” He said in pure disbelief about a hand being stretched out to him from inside the waterfall. The next moment Kentaro stepped half out of it, looking at his brother as confused as the other way around.</p><p>“What are you doing? What- How…?”</p><p>Kentaro was standing under the full force of the waterfall, but the water didn’t even touch him. Like an invisible wall it seemed to flow around him. “I have no clue why, but I suddenly had the feeling I could go through it and I tried. So take my hand and come with me, because I have the feeling if I think about this too much it might not work anymore.”</p><p>There was so much speaking against trying this, because trying meant they could fail. Who said that Nikaido would be even able to follow Kentaro without getting crushed? He was an Infirm after all.</p><p>“Trust me,” Kentaro said and stretched out his hand. Seeing his little brother this confident about his still unexplored abilities made Nikaido finally move and he took his hand and dared his first step under the crushing water and it worked. The shield seemed to protect them both and so Nikaido made sure to walk as close to Kentaro as possible.</p><p>It was making Nikaido feel proud of his little brother to see how he tried so hard to make the best use of this abilities, but with the water crushing down right above them he couldn’t concentrate on anything else than the question when they would be through and luckily his question got answered seconds later and they finally arrived back on the path.</p><p>“I knew it,” Kentaro said as he looked ahead at the clear path. “This waterfall is something like a barricade for protection.</p><p>“You mean whoever uses this path wants Infirms to stay outside.” It wasn’t even sounding that weird, because Infirms had hunted Phenomenists down for years so they were definitely not fond of them.</p><p>“Let’s see where it leads to,” Kentaro said and kept walking. They kept walking for quite some time, the path not continuing this clearly after a while, with the forest showing rocky surfaces on one side and thick forest to the other side, but Kentaro kept going as if he knew exactly where he aimed for. Just after quite some time of walking when Nikaido doubted that they were reaching any certain place at all after losing the direct path, Kentaro suddenly stopped.</p><p>“What is it?” Nikaido asked and followed the boy’s look through the forest. Then he saw the movement. There was someone hiding behind the trees. “Kentaro, wait!”</p><p>But Kentaro dared to make a few steps forward and when he came into a dangerous distance for both sides, they suddenly saw who had been hiding. Two kids dashed out of their hiding place, running off into the opposite direction. A girl and a boy, definitely still younger than ten.</p><p>Kentaro and Nikaido exchanged a worried look, but then decided to carefully follow them. They hadn’t intended to scare them, but they didn't know that there were people around.</p><p>“Look there is a glade!” Kentaro said as he saw the last sunlight before the dawn breaking through the trees. The place in front of them wasn’t just a small place though. They could see over a huge place without trees and in the middle was a village. All sides were thick forest, but between the village and them was a wide-open area with nothing but grass on it.</p><p>“Shall we try and talk to the people here?” Kentaro asked, a bit worried as he saw the two kids running back towards the few first huts on their way and on that way the boy suddenly stopped at a wooden pole and he rang the bell on it before he also vanished between the huts. There were just small buildings out of wood, except for one bigger building in the middle of the village which had obviously been made out of the stones they got from the steep walls in the mountains. But with the evening hours approaching no one was out in the open fields around them.</p><p>When they finally dared to move out on the grass to walk down to the village they saw more movement down between the buildings.</p><p>The first person coming into their sight walked past the last huts with big steps and Nikaido automatically walked in front of Kentaro, not liking the way they got approached.</p><p>“Be careful there is a small stream in front of you,” Kentaro warned him and pulled on his sleeve before he could actually stumble over it. It wasn’t wide nor deep, but it seemed to surround the whole village.</p><p>“Thank you,” Nikaido said before he wanted to make a small jump over it, but then shouting down in the village made them both look up.</p><p>They were too far away to hear them clearly, but there was a second person running after the man who was approaching them. Before they could decide what to do though a movement of the man made them both freeze.</p><p>Without any kind of warning fire was forming in front of him and even worse it was moving towards them. The fire blast was huge and way too fast to even think about running from it.</p><p>“Get down!” Nikaido shouted at Kentaro, but when he wanted to drag him down, Kentaro jumped in front of him. Nikaido feared for him to get burned alive, but Kentaro didn’t seem afraid at all. When the fire blast was right in front of them, he lifted his arms and with that he moved the water of the stream into a wall turning the fire into smoke.</p><p>Nikaido was out of words through that sudden move, because it seemed like Kentaro was always able to control his abilities at exactly the right moments.</p><p>“Stop it! You don’t have to attack them!”</p><p>Now the voices were clearer, but that also meant they were close by. Before Nikaido could decide what to do he saw Kentaro stumbling to the back. At the same moment he saw another blast of fire coming through the smoke, but this time the person from before had the fire still right in front of him, jumping over the stream ready to attack. Nikaido sank to his knees, catching Kentaro as the boy fell unconsciously into his arms before he turned towards the person attacking them. To his surprise the man who was around the same age as him, stopped his attack and stepped right in front of them, the fire still visible in front of his hand.</p><p>“Who are you?” The man asked in a dangerous tone. He had brown wavy hair, already a bit too long for Nikaido’s liking, but that wasn’t important at the moment. In a physical fight he was sure he could beat the slim figure in front of him, but against a Phenomenist he had no chance.</p><p>Before Nikaido could reply the person in front of him yelped as he got hit on the back of his head, losing his fire and rubbing his head with a curse. “What the heck was that for?” He asked as he turned to a boy coming out of the finally resolving smoke.</p><p>“That is my question! Taisuke, I told you not to attack them. Can’t you for once not be this suspicious about people?”</p><p>It surprised Nikaido to see how the older one pouted on the younger one’s reaction, but a groan from Kentaro made him focus back on his little brother.</p><p>“He must be exhausted after using his abilities in such a hurry. Come, I will bring you to our doctor,” the boy said, to which the older one gave him a disbelieving look.</p><p>“Taiga, are you out of your mind? We don’t even know them. I won’t let them get into the village like this.”</p><p>The younger one rolled his eyes immediately and pointed back at the village. “Didn’t you hear what Hana and Ken said? They came from the waterfall.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make them good people!”</p><p>“For god’s sake Taisuke, look at them,” Taiga yelled this time, Nikaido tightening his grip around Kentaro a bit more as both their attention was back on them. “They aren’t even wet, so they both made it through with the boy’s ability. You know how much trust is needed to make an Infirm be able to follow through that. And you just saw yourself how he deflected your attack with his abilities.”</p><p>“Just because they trust each other, doesn’t mean they are good people.”</p><p>“And you are?” Nikaido said, not being able to stay silent anymore.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Taisuke shot back annoyed.</p><p>“You attacked us out of the blue. We didn’t do anything!”</p><p>“You are here, that is already enough!” Taisuke shot back at which Taiga finally had enough and hit the other one against the shoulder.</p><p>“Could you finally cut it out!”</p><p>“Okay that’s enough both of you,” a third person was suddenly heard. Through all their fighting they hadn’t even realized that someone else had walked up to them. A look down to the village also showed that a lot of people were now curiously looking at them.</p><p>“Mitsu, would you please make him stop?” Taiga asked of the short man walking up to them with a calm expression.</p><p>“Would you stop behaving like the older brother?” Taisuke shot back, resulting in Taiga getting ready to jump at him, but while they had moved towards each other, they suddenly found themselves a few meters apart from each other. Nikaido gasped on the sudden movement he couldn’t explain. As if lifted by an invisible force they had ended up being thrown out of balance, but then placed back on their feet without harm.</p><p>“Good that I am the oldest brother and you two have to listen to me,” Hiromitsu said with a faint smile on which Taisuke rolled his eyes and Taiga pouted.</p><p>“Sorry for the rough greeting,” Hiromitsu finally addressed Nikaido this time. “I am sure you both had a tough journey up here. This place is not easy to find, but I guess the boy’s abilities have helped you to not lose your way.”</p><p>Nikaido felt a bit relieved about the normal conversation and it also didn’t seem like the other one would suddenly attack them. “If you want, we can take you in for a bit? I bet the boy needs a long rest after using his abilities for the waterfall and defending you against my stupid brother.”</p><p>A growl from Taisuke was heard on that comment, but he didn’t try to interfere this time.</p><p>“If it’s really okay then we would like to stay for a while, but just if we don’t have to fear any more sudden attacks,” Nikaido said looking at Taisuke who gave him a death glare in return.</p><p>“Don’t worry about him. He can be really suspicious about people, but he won’t do you any harm, you have my word.”</p><p>Still not completely trusting the situation, Nikaido lifted his brother up in his arms and nodded. “Then I would like to accept your offer and give my brother a good rest.”</p><p>“Oh great, more siblings in the village,” Taiga let out in excitement.</p><p>“If you want, I can make it easier for you,” Hiromitsu said as he lifted his arm and Nikaido felt how Kentaro got lighter in his arms, but he protectively kept a tight grip on him and shook his head.</p><p>“Thank you, but I will carry him myself.”</p><p>“As you wish,” Hiromitsu said before he turned and walked down to the village, followed by Taisuke who immediately started a discussion with him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he is really not as bad as he seems at first,” Taiga said as he stepped next to Nikaido. “By the way what’s your name?”</p><p>“I am Nikaido and this is my little brother Kentaro.”</p><p>“Welcome to our village then Nikaido,” Taiga said with a smile as they started walking down towards the village. “As you already heard through all the scolding, I am Taiga, I am the youngest of us three siblings,” Taiga explained as he pointed at the two men walking in front of them. “Taisuke is the middle brother and Hiromitsu the oldest one. Hiromitsu is also the leader of this village at least at the moment. But this might be too much explanation at once, so let’s get you somewhere to rest for now.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded gratefully, because he would definitely get a headache if he explained too much right away. When they arrived between the first huts Nikaido saw people whispering, pointing at them and some even trying to hide from them. There were families, children, young and old people, like a normal village they seemed to live here in the mountains, but Nikaido was already sure that they didn’t trust outsiders. While women couldn't become Phenomenists and seemed to live peacefully with everyone in the village it was definitely a different matter for strangers who were Infirms.</p><p>“Don’t take it personally, this village has quite a rough background with outsiders,” Taiga confirmed Nikaido’s worries. “Come over here, this is our doctor's house, he will have a quick look at Kentaro.”</p><p>Hiromitsu was waiting in front of the hut, but Taisuke had kept walking, now moving away from them. He turned around to Nikaido with another annoyed look before he entered the stone building in the middle of the village, disappearing out of his view.</p><p>“This is Miyata, our doctor,” Taiga introduced the man standing in the open door.</p><p>“Oh I see, we have someone who is still quite overwhelmed by his own abilities,” Miyata greeted them with a look at Kentaro’s condition. “Come in.”<br/>
Nikaido stepped inside the wooden hut, surprised to find quite some advanced equipment inside. It looked almost the same as the hospitals in the city, just a bit more chaotic as a few things were of course missing and others were improvised.</p><p>“We built the village ourselves, but we got what we needed from bigger towns down the mountain as they were all destroyed and abandoned anyways,” Hiromitsu explained.</p><p>“Put him here,” Miyata said as he pointed to a simple mattress on a wooden frame, a bit higher than a normal bed. Nikaido carefully put him down and stepped back as Miyata stepped closer.</p><p>Steps from another room made Nikaido turn and he spotted the two kids from before peeking inside the room.</p><p>“Kids, what did I tell you?” Miyata said scolding on which they vanished with a giggle. “Sorry, they are way too hyper to stay out of my treatment room even though I always tell them they are not allowed in here.”</p><p>Nikaido didn’t mind though after all it was thanks to them that they had found the village. “Are they your children?”</p><p>“Yes my daughter Hana, she is seven and my son Ken, he is five.”</p><p>Nikaido was sure that he would do a typical routine check up on Kentaro, but all he did was put his hand on the boy’s forehead and then silence followed.</p><p>A bit confused about the situation, Nikaido looked at Hiromitsu who gave him an understanding look. “Miyata can use power transfer to see with his own abilities if something isn’t okay with your brother.”</p><p>“Confusing, right?” Taiga said with a chuckle, because Nikaido’s expression told them that he was not getting at all what was going on. “Don’t worry we can explain everything in more detail if you want?”</p><p>“To be honest I would prefer the explanations later, for now I am happy if you can make sure he is fine, however that looks like.”</p><p>“You seem to be able to judge people very well,” Hiromitsu said on which Nikaido looked up at him. “It’s not easy to leave the treatment of your brother in a stranger's hands.”</p><p>“It’s the first time someone wants to help him after finding out he is a Phenomenist. Usually everyone tries to kill him.”</p><p>“Are you from one of the cities?” Taiga said curiously, to which Nikaido nodded.</p><p>“We lived in the eastern city since the end of the war, but a while ago Kentaro’s abilities suddenly surfaced and we couldn’t stay when he failed in hiding them.”</p><p>“You made a wise decision to run and did a good job in staying alive until now,” Hiromitsu praised him.</p><p>“It’s not like I did much, Kentaro was the one who could somehow sense you and find the way,” Nikaido said on which Hiromitsu shook his head.</p><p>“He needs you more than you might think,” the man said with a smile before Miyata finally walked up to them.</p><p>“He is completely fine, just pretty exhausted. A night of sleep will help him a lot.”</p><p>“Perfect, then let’s find you an empty hut,” Hiromitsu announced and looked at Taiga who got the message which Nikaido of course had no clue about and the boy excused himself, leaving the hut.</p><p>“When he wakes up make sure that he stays calm,” Miyata added on which Nikaido raised an eyebrow at him. “Do you know if he has any other abilities?”</p><p>Nikaido shook his head on that question. “I just saw him using water until now and he said he doesn’t know if he has any other abilities.”</p><p>“Then let’s be careful for now. When a Phenomenist is stressed, they might do things they regret later if they can’t control their abilities. If he can just use water then it won’t be a problem, because as long as you don’t put a bucket of water in front of his bed there won’t be anything he can use, but if he has other abilities, it could also be dangerous for you to be around when he wakes up.”</p><p>“I am staying with him no matter what.”</p><p>Hiromitsu had obviously seen that reply coming and nodded. “Well then let’s go.”</p><p>Nikaido thanked Miyata for his quick check up and lifted Kentaro up again, walking towards the door with Hiromitsu. When they stepped outside, Taiga was waiting for them, but he wasn’t alone. A man with dark red hair stood next to him and gave them a calm smile.</p><p>“Let me introduce you,” Hiromitsu said as he walked up to them. “This is Massu, one of our Phenomenists.”</p><p>“Nice to see a new face in a while,” Massu said with a bright smile. “Especially a calm water user that is always nicer than the hot headed Phenomenists,” Massu added on which Taiga hit him with his elbow.</p><p>“You are a fire user yourself idiot.”</p><p>“But I am not blowing up half the village,” Massu said with a wink on which Taiga laughed.</p><p>“Yeah, we leave that to Taisuke,” Taiga replied teasingly.</p><p>It wasn’t clear if they were joking or not, but Nikaido just started to dislike Taisuke even more after hearing that.</p><p>“So Massu will have an eye on you for the time being,” Hiromitsu said, to which Nikaido gave him a suspicious look. “I know, I am sorry about that, but you have to understand that we just need to be sure that we can trust you. I know that applies the other way around too, so don’t worry he won’t stay too close. He will just guard around the hut we will give you, making sure you stay safe and our people stay safe.”</p><p>As much as it seemed like a way too big security matter Nikaido couldn’t deny that they had all right to be suspicious about them and this was a way nicer treatment than they would get in the city.</p><p>After agreeing to everything, they got to one of the huts the furthest away from the center, also something Nikaido could understand. The hut was as all the others a simple one out of wood and the inside was just one big room. There was a fire place which made Nikaido feel relieved right away as the sun had already set and it was pretty cold here in the mountains. There was just one bed in the hut, but it was spacious enough for both of them and a chair was standing next to the fireplace as well as a table with two chairs they could use too.</p><p>“I know it’s not much, but please try and rest as well as you can,” Hiromitsu said before he and Taiga left.</p><p>“If anything is up, please make sure to let me know, I won’t bite you know?” Massu said with a smile and Nikaido thanked him before he went inside and put Kentaro carefully on the bed.</p><p>It seemed like Taiga had prepared the hut for them earlier as the fire was already lit and there was also some food and water put on the table.</p><p>“Let’s hope that my gut feeling is as good as yours,” Nikaido whispered as he sat down next to Kentaro and caressed his hair.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Kentaro woke up with a feeling of having slept a few days in a row. A bit disorientated he opened his eyes, facing a wooden wall. With a groan he tried to remember what had happened and then the image of the fire blast getting thrown towards them flashed through his mind and with a gasp he sat up. Even though he hadn’t done anything else but that, a shattering sound from inside the room made him flinch. Looking over to the table he saw a cup on the ground, water all over the floor.</p><p>Still too confused about what had happened after he had passed out, he looked next to him and felt immediate relief to find Nikaido next to him. His brother must have been too exhausted to even realize the noise as he didn’t seem to be disturbed in his sleep. The fact that he was sleeping this calmly made Kentaro hope that whatever had happened was a good outcome and wouldn’t bring them any more trouble.</p><p>Carefully he got up from the bed, not wanting to wake the other one up. The fireplace was still warm, but the fire seemed to have gone out a while ago. Now that it was daytime and the sunlight was already searching its way into the hut, he decided to leave it like this.</p><p>When he dared to look out of one of the windows, he could see the village they had arrived at the day before. People were already outside, some of them carrying grain so there were definitely fields around. Then he saw the two kids from the day before running around close to their hut, a woman yelling their names to make them follow her.</p><p>Curiously Kentaro went over to the door, before he turned to Nikaido once more. His brother needed the rest, but somehow Kentaro felt like he could leave him alone without fearing for any kind of trouble. His stomach feeling had brought them just positive results until now, so he hoped it would continue like that. Carefully Kentaro sneaked out the hut, closing the door as silent as possible.</p><p>“And where are we heading?”</p><p>On the sound of an unfamiliar voice Kentaro swirled around, unfortunately realizing too late that there had been stairs in front of him and with a squeal he fell to the front, already preparing for a hard landing on the ground. But the person in front of the hut had caught him on the arm at the last second, but released him the moment Kentaro found his balance.</p><p>“A small klutz, aren’t we?” Massu asked with a smile. “Did you have a good rest?”</p><p>On the question Kentaro nodded, but kept looking at the unknown man.</p><p>“Oh sorry, I guess Nikaido is still asleep and didn’t tell you anything yet?”</p><p>Once more Kentaro nodded and Massu stepped a bit back. “I’m Massu. For a while I will look out for you two if you want to call it that way.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you,” Kentaro said as politely as he could.</p><p>“I heard you were quite impressive standing up against Taisuke yesterday.”</p><p>He didn’t know the name, but he knew that it must have been the man who had attacked them and immediately his expression turned a bit darker.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he won’t attack you again,” Massu said, immediately trying to cheer him up.</p><p>“Don’t make promises my brother can’t keep,” Taiga was heard as he approached them. “You know Taisuke’s mood changes every few minutes.”</p><p>With a teasing smile he walked up to them, giving Kentaro a scanning look on which the boy looked a bit embarrassed to the ground. “I am Taiga, the little brother of the idiot who attacked you yesterday. Don’t worry he got a lot of scolding from our oldest brother already.”</p><p>“By the way, what are you doing here?” Massu finally asked on which Taiga pointed at Kentaro.</p><p>“I thought I could show him around a bit? You want to wake up your brother as well?”</p><p>“I actually would like to give him as much of a rest as he can get,” Kentaro said and Taiga nodded.</p><p>“Totally understandable, then let’s go?”</p><p>“Taiga, I don’t think this is a good idea.”</p><p>“No, you think that Taisuke won’t think of this as a good idea, but luckily he is not here, right?” Taiga teased.</p><p>A bit hesitant Kentaro walked after Taiga who had turned away from him without even looking if he was following him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Taiga is the best company you can have to make sure to not get into trouble,” Massu explained. “I will be here in case your brother wakes up.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Kentaro replied and hurried after Taiga.</p><p>“So where do you want to start?” Taiga asked as they walked around the village.</p><p>“Maybe by knowing where what is?” Kentaro asked and Taiga nodded.</p><p>“Well, that is easily explained luckily,” the boy explained as they walked up to the big stone building in the middle of the village. It looked pretty strong judging by the heavy stone walls and even the door seemed to be made out of iron instead of wood.</p><p>“This is the meeting hall. We use it for gatherings and also just to eat together sometimes. It’s also our shelter in case we get attacked. You see the bells all around?”</p><p>Kentaro nodded as he had seen Ken using them when they had arrived. One was right next to the meeting hall while others were scattered around the village even a bit outside of the center.</p><p>“We use them to warn the others in case there is an emergency. Everyone who is not part of our fighters has to come to the city hall immediately when someone rings the bell.”</p><p>“So outsiders like us cause a lot of uproar in your village, sorry about that,” Kentaro said.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that. We’re just trying to be ready in case someone from the city shows up and I don’t mean civilians. We have fighters to stand against them, but we still need to be careful.”</p><p>“When you say fighters, you mean the Phenomenists in your village?” Kentaro asked and before Taiga could reply there was an impact heard from the other side of the village on which Kentaro gave Taiga a worried look, but the latter just smiled.</p><p>“Perfect timing to explain this a bit easier,” Taiga said and waved at him. “Follow me.”</p><p>They passed a few more huts on their way, Kentaro trying to ignore the way he was stared at by most of the people.</p><p>“So over there are our fields by the way,” Taiga said as they left the last huts behind them and left the village to the opposite side from where Nikaido and Kentaro had come from the day before. There were rice fields along one side, which also explained the stream flowing down there. They had obviously built it to be able to water their fields.</p><p>“Down here just the fighters are allowed,” Taiga explained as they walked towards a rocky area right before the forest started again. As they kept walking around a small hillside another open space got visible, but it wasn’t at all the same as the village. It looked like a battlefield. Stones, more like huge rocks, were lying around as if they had been ripped out of the ground and tossed around. Cracks in the ground made it almost impossible to run without falling and still there were people in front of them fighting on exactly this destroyed ground.</p><p>“It’s our personal training ground. Here they can destroy what they want without risking to hurt someone, well except other fighters, but that is their own fault,” Taiga said with a chuckle. “We also have the stream from the village flow down here so water users can use their abilities as well, it also functions as a protection surrounding the village. But right now, you’re the only water user in the village.”</p><p>Kentaro saw the stream being just a few meters in front of them and going directly down to the training ground. Absentmindedly he kept staring at the people training. They were so concentrated that they hadn’t even noticed their presence yet. When a fire blast was shot through the air, he spotted Taisuke and his look immediately darkened.</p><p>“Don’t worry I know he overdid it at your first meeting, but as soon as he gets to know you better, he won’t be that aggressive anymore.”</p><p>“Better for him or I won’t just dodge next time,” Kentaro hissed on which Taiga gave him a stunt expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk like this about your brother. I wouldn’t want anyone to talk like this about mine either,” Kentaro apologized, making Taiga laugh to his surprise.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Taisuke gets scolded by Mitsu and me often enough he could use scolding from other people as well.”</p><p>Kentaro focused back on the people on the training ground, trying to figure out what abilities they had. He spotted a few younger boys as well between them, but while he could see how some of them lifted stones around them and even stopped people’s movements others weren’t using any abilities and kept attacking with their bare fists or weapons.</p><p>“Wataru and Aran are Infirms,” Taiga explained before Kentaro could even ask. “They are our best fighters without abilities. I train with them sometimes as well, but Mitsu is too much of an overprotective brother and he won’t let me participate in the training with the Phenomenists.”</p><p>“So you are an Infirm as well?” Kentaro asked a bit surprised even though the boy hadn’t shown him any sign of being a Phenomenist.</p><p>“I am. The only one of us three, but well I am still young so who knows maybe one day I will also have some ability?” It wasn’t obvious if he wanted to become like his brothers or if he preferred it to stay as he was, but Kentaro wouldn’t judge him for either. “Anyway, the reason why I am usually not training with them is actually Taisuke. He is even worse than Mitsu and super bad at control so as soon as something goes wrong at the training he usually freaks and because that brings the others in danger I am staying away from his training.”</p><p>“Sounds like a lot of trouble,” Kentaro said this time with a light smile on which Taiga chuckled.</p><p>“Trust me this village is full of trouble makers.”</p><p>“Who are the others?” Kentaro asked, pointing down at the fighters on which Taiga pointed at a dark brown haired boy who was throwing fire towards Wataru. Even though Wataru had no powers to defend himself he dodged the fire blasts quite well and got easily into the reach of the boy.</p><p>“That is Fuma. He is super explosive with his blasts and if they hit it will be the last attack you will get hit by, but-”</p><p>Before Taiga could explain more, Fuma stumbled to the back after getting kicked in the stomach by Wataru. The kick didn’t seem too bad and usually he could just form another blast now to get out of his reach, but then he fell on one knee, obviously exhausted.</p><p>“He has no control over his abilities, so while he can use an impressive amount of strength before fainting, he will easily overdo it,” Taiga explained. “The other two boys down there are Myuto and Ryosuke, both of them use telekinesis and Ryosuke can also use power transfer, Fuma as well by the way.”</p><p>“Okay I really think someone needs to explain all the ability stuff to me later, because I feel like I don’t even know what I can do or what others can do,” Kentaro explained a bit embarrassed on which Taiga patted his shoulder.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Without even knowing what had happened both boys turned towards the training ground and a fire blast was suddenly coming towards them. Taiga yelped and stumbled to the back while Kentaro stepped intuitively to the front and raised his hands. The fire blast was already past the stream, but that didn’t stop Kentaro and he found a way to make the water form a wave to catch up to the fire, burying it under it right before it could actually hit them. The result was that both of them ended up being swallowed by the wave as well and after the first moment of surprise Taiga started laughing. “Nice safe!”</p><p>“Are you okay?” Myuto asked as he ran towards them. “Sorry I didn’t notice you were watching and redirected Taisuke’s blast.”</p><p>“It’s okay, sorry we shouldn’t have come by without letting you know,” Taiga said, but before Kentaro could also say something Taisuke was up next to them as well.</p><p>“What the hell were you thinking?” Taisuke yelled at them the moment he walked up to them.</p><p>“Sorry I was showing Kentaro around and-”</p><p>“Where is Massu?” Taisuke interrupted him.</p><p>“Back at the house, Nikaido was still sleeping so-”</p><p>Without waiting for any more explanations Taisuke suddenly grabbed Kentaro by the arm and wanted to drag him away from the training ground. “This is no place for you and I don’t want you to walk around without guards.”</p><p>Kentaro didn’t even know what to reply and he wasn’t planning on causing an uproar so he just let himself get dragged along, but suddenly Taiga jumped in between them, slashing his brother’s hand away and standing in front of Kentaro.</p><p>“Why don’t you just go back to training and leave him alone?” Taiga hissed at his brother. “As you can see, we are totally fine without you. I was showing him around, no need to get angry at him.”</p><p>“Fine then I get angry at you,” Taisuke hissed back. “I forbid you to be around him or his brother without anyone else.”</p><p>Taiga couldn’t hide an ironic chuckle on that. “Yeah right, because Kentaro is so damn dangerous. It was your fire blast that almost hit me right now, but Kentaro’s water which protected me, just so you know.”</p><p>“Guys could we just calm down a bit?” Myuto asked carefully on which he got hit by two death glares at once. “Well I was just suggesting…”</p><p>Without testing his luck too much Myuto retreated a bit and the other fighters also looked up to them, but looked more annoyed instead of wanting to interfere. It seemed like this sibling fight wasn’t something new for them.</p><p>“Anyways, you get back now!” Taisuke said and shoved Taiga out of the way to pull Kentaro away from the training ground. This time though he seemed so annoyed already that he actually hurt him with his tight grip and Kentaro let out a hiss, automatically trying to pull his wrist out of the other one’s grip.</p><p>“Stop struggling and keep moving,” Taisuke shouted, tightening his grip, but suddenly something changed and Kentaro felt a weird pain shooting up his arm to his chest and with a gasp he put his free hand up to his chest.</p><p>“Hands off my brother!”</p><p>The shouting came from the entrance of the training ground where Nikaido stormed down to them, followed by Massu. Taisuke rolled his eyes in annoyance not even realizing Kentaro’s condition as he let go of him and turned to Nikaido.</p><p>“What do you-”</p><p>He couldn’t end his sentence as Nikaido hit him straight in the face the moment he reached him on which Massu finally dashed towards them as well, already in between them before Taisuke could even think about freaking out, but the fire was already visible around his fists.</p><p>“Okay, time out, both of you!” Massu scolded them both.</p><p>“Hey, Kentaro, are you okay?” Taiga asked worriedly as the boy kept breathing heavily and leant to the front, his hand still clenched into his shirt over his chest.</p><p>“What did you do to him?” Nikaido shouted at Taisuke as he walked up to Kentaro and took a closer look at him. Kentaro reached out for him immediately, pulling himself into a hug as if this could somehow stop the weird pain.</p><p>“I’m sorry. Taiga was just showing me around,” Kentaro replied, out of breath as if he had been training with the others.</p><p>“We can discuss that later, what did happen that you are in pain?”</p><p>“I don’t know, everything was fine and then suddenly the pain shot through my arm to my chest.”</p><p>“Wait, let me see,” Massu said and Nikaido made space for him so he could have a closer look at him before he turned towards Taisuke instead. The latter wasn’t pleased by Massu’s scanning look and even less happy about the annoyed tongue clicking he let out seconds later.</p><p>“What?” Taisuke growled.</p><p>“Do you feel by any way totally refreshed as if you haven’t even trained right now?”</p><p>“What, why would I-” Taisuke started, but then he gasped, realizing that he was right and then he looked over to Kentaro. It was the first time they saw an apologizing look on his face.</p><p>“As I thought,” Massu said before he looked down at the other fighters. “Ryosuke, can you come up here for a moment?”</p><p>The boy in question came running immediately. A boy just a bit older than Kentaro and Taiga, gray eyes and light brown hair. A silver earring on his left ear was making him look like a person hard to approach, but his honest smile made that first impression change.</p><p>“So, as it seems, Taisuke has stolen some power from Kentaro,” Massu explained.</p><p>“Not on purpose though,” Taisuke added on which he got a glare from his little brother.</p><p>“Anyway, would you mind restoring it?” Massu continued.</p><p>“Sure, no problem,” the boy said, but when he stepped closer, Kentaro pulled himself back against Nikaido’s chest and his older brother looked a bit nervous at everyone around.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Ryosuke is the best when it comes to power transfer, he will make the pain stop,” Massu soothed them and Kentaro looked over his shoulder at Ryosuke who waited patiently for the boy to come to him. A bit hesitantly Kentaro finally stepped away from his brother and stretched his arm out to Ryosuke.</p><p>“The pain will be gone in no time, don’t worry,” Ryosuke promised and closed both of his hands around Kentaro’s hand and then without anything actually happening the pain was gone.</p><p>“Here you go,” Ryosuke said with a smile and stepped back as Nikaido took a closer look at his brother who didn’t seem to be in pain at all from one second to the other.</p><p>“Wow, that is a convenient ability,” Kentaro said.</p><p>“And a dangerous one when not used wisely,” Taiga added with a side glance to his brother on which Massu clapped his hands.</p><p>“Okay great so everything is finally back to normal. Taisuke, you go back to training, Taiga you come with us. No discussions!”</p><p>Luckily everyone seemed to respect Massu enough to really not discuss this any further and Nikaido didn’t even feel the need to apologize as he looked up at Taisuke, seeing how he would definitely carry a bruise on his cheekbone from his punch.</p><p>“He didn’t do it on purpose, let’s just leave,” Kentaro said as he realized his brother’s rising tension and luckily Nikaido turned without any mocking comment.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>This time Kentaro felt even worse than the other times he had collapsed and a heavy headache made him groan and keep his eyes closed.</p><p>“Finally awake?”</p><p>On the sound of his brother’s voice Kentaro finally opened his eyes, finding himself in their hut and it was bright daylight outside so he had at least slept since the afternoon the day before.</p><p>“Please tell me that you didn’t get angry at Taisuke?”</p><p>Nikaido couldn’t hide a chuckle on that question and shook his head. “This is the first thing you worry about?”</p><p>“Well, I provoked him on purpose so it wouldn’t be fair to get angry at him.”</p><p>“Yeah, I heard everything from Hiromitsu, but please promise me to not be so reckless with your abilities from now on. I know you want to prove that you can keep up with them, but remember that your own ability could cause you harm as well.”</p><p>Kentaro felt embarrassed for causing trouble again while all he wanted was proving that he was in control of his ability, which reminded him that he wasn’t, because he couldn’t even remember how he had ended up with that shield of water around him. With an analyzing look he touched his own skin, but nothing seemed to have changed.</p><p>“I heard you used a technique Hiromitsu hasn’t seen until now,” Nikaido said with a proud undertone.</p><p>“I guess I did. I am not sure how though. It just felt right to do, well, nothing? And let the water do the rest? That sounds stupid, right?”</p><p>Nikaido shook his head when he got up and walked over to the fireplace to put in more wood as it was a pretty cold day now that the winter time was rushing towards their mountain.</p><p>“For an Infirm I guess it sounds weird indeed, but I know that you wouldn’t risk your life for some stupid training so I guess your ability might guide you more than you guide it?”</p><p>That was indeed a good explanation, because it was always like the water was telling him what he could do and not the other way around.</p><p>“For now, rest a bit more and let’s get dinner in the meeting hall later if you feel well enough? Wataru came by earlier telling me that they had a meeting with a small dinner together in the evening.”</p><p>That was some distraction he could definitely need and getting food sounded amazing to his empty stomach as well.</p><p>***</p><p>The meeting hall seemed like a building of the city instead of this village. Before the war they were all modern like this, but with limited sources it was understandable that they couldn’t actually build a whole village with heavy metal doors and strong stone walls.</p><p>The hall itself was just one big room with wooden tables and chairs spread over the place. In the front was a podium which was usually used when they were having meetings, but for now Nikaido and Kentaro hadn’t been part of any which was understandable after all they were still strangers to most of them.</p><p>Miyata greeted them on the way in and asked Kentaro how he was feeling. His impatient kids cut the conversation short as he was dragged away by them so they could finally eat.</p><p>“This reminds me of the camp side we used to go to,” Nikaido said with a faint smile.</p><p>“I remember bits and pieces of that time,” Kentaro replied. He had been too young to remember much from the peaceful times before the war and his memories of places and faces was only faint.</p><p>“Oh you came, great,” Hiromitsu greeted them.</p><p>“Thank you for inviting us,” Nikaido replied and followed Hiromitsu through the room as he walked towards a table where Wataru and Massu were sitting, but stopped before sitting down.</p><p>Kentaro wasn’t even surprised when Taiga showed up next to him and hooked his elbow into his. “Want to sit with us?”</p><p>Nikaido lifted an eyebrow at the sudden invitation which was obviously just meant for his little brother, but he realized soon that Hiromitsu nodded gratefully at Taiga.</p><p>“Nikaido, why don’t you join us and let the younger ones have some playtime?” Hiromitsu offered.</p><p>“We’re not that young,” Taiga complained, but dragged Kentaro after him anyway. “Here, sit down.”</p><p>Kentaro did as he was told as he was shoved on a bench next to Fuma and Taiga sat down on his other side. Opposite him Myuto and Aran were sitting, but they were eating in silence for now. Looking over his shoulder Kentaro spotted his brother having a talk with the village leader and the other older ones instead of having dinner first. He couldn’t hear them over the talking of all the people in the room, but he didn’t miss the short glances over to their table from time to time.</p><p>“Don’t bother, they always talk about the complicated things,” Fuma explained before he shoved a way too big bread in his mouth resulting in him coughing a few times before he was able to swallow it.</p><p>“I just wonder why my brother was called over for it?”</p><p>“To be honest I think it has something to do with the patrols,” Taiga explained, on which Taiga tilted his head in confusion. “Do you realize that some people are missing? Or were missing over some part of the day?”</p><p>Now that he took a look around he indeed realized that he couldn’t spot Ryosuke or Taisuke, as well as some of their other fighters he had met before.</p><p>“We usually send out people to patrol around our borders. Not every entrance to the village is blocked by something like the waterfall you came through,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“So not only Phenomenists are going on patrol?”</p><p>“There has to be at least one in the group, yes. We usually form groups of two or three members. For tonight Ryosuke and Taisuke are out with other fighters. There are quite a few points we have to check, but we cannot let every Phenomenist leave the village for such a long time, so we have to take the risk and leave some points open.”</p><p>“Sounds logical,” Kentaro said nodding.</p><p>“I am going tomorrow morning, maybe you can ask if you can join?” Fuma said. “I am with Massu so there is another spot open if you want to join?”</p><p>A disapproving hum came from the other side of the table and all eyes were on Aran. The boy didn’t even seem to feel caught and kept looking at Kentaro with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“Any complaints?” Fuma asked dangerously.</p><p>“Oh no of course not. Let a Phenomenist we don’t know anything about patrol our borders. Don’t be surprised though if he vanishes after seeing them all so that he can report back to the city.”</p><p>“And now he comes with his <a href="https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">conspiracy</a> theory again,” Fuma said and couldn’t from forming a mocking smile.</p><p>“Stop making fun of him,” Taiga interfered warningly. “Aran, we know you had a lot of trouble with Phenomenists before, but we didn’t judge you either when you came to us.”</p><p>Aran didn’t seem in any way getting calmer through that statement and he crossed his arms to his chest with a pouting expression.</p><p>“I don’t want to make things even worse, but can I ask something?” Kentaro dared to ask.</p><p>“Sure, what is it?” Taiga asked as open as always.</p><p>“Why would I as a Phenomenist report to any city?”</p><p>It was a valid question, because Phenomenists weren’t allowed in any city, but Aran had just made it sound like he was of the bad kind and with the people actually hunting them down.</p><p>“Why would I leave the city?” Aran asked back.</p><p>A moment of silence followed his question as Kentaro wasn’t sure if that was a rhetorical question or not.</p><p>“Aran thinks there are Phenomenists in the city teaming up with Infirms to get rid of those who don’t want to corporate,” Myuto finally spilled.</p><p>“I don’t think that I know it. I’ve seen them and exactly that is why I had to get away.”</p><p>“Teaming up with the enemy,” Kentaro let out in a low voice on which Aran seemed ready to explode, but Kentaro wasn’t actually making fun of him. “Doesn’t sound impossible.”</p><p>“Oh god, not you too,” Fuma said, rolling his eyes. “It’s enough when we have one idiot coming up with all those stories.”</p><p>It happened before anyone could react. Kentaro gasped, but Fuma didn’t even move.</p><p>The water which had stopped midair came out of Aran’s cup. Angry about getting made fun of all the time he had emptied it towards Fuma, but it hadn’t been Fuma using his ability as he could only use fire and power transfer.</p><p>“Oh no, did Myuto ruin all the fun for you?” Fuma teased, resulting in Aran slamming the cup back on the table, making some people turn towards them.</p><p>“One day you will all pay for not believing me,” Aran hissed before he stormed out of the meeting hall.</p><p>“Well, so much for a calm dinner,” Myuto said as he used the cup to catch the midair hanging water. When he got up no one stopped him or asked where he was going, but all Kentaro could do was staring forth and back between Fuma and Taiga in confusion.</p><p>“Okay, so do I get to know what is going on?”</p><p>“Never seen a quarrel before?” Fuma asked while he kept eating as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Okay I might not know any of you that well, but this was completely awkward. You do believe him, don’t you?”</p><p>“Fast in catching up as always,” Taiga said with a smile. “Yes, we do, but it’s not like he has any names or locations. There are too many things he is just overly suspicious about. He said he has seen someone who got caught as a Phenomenist suddenly showing up with the soldiers one day. But he could never confirm that it was indeed the same person or if he was using any abilities.”</p><p>“And there is nothing we can do about it. He ran from the city, feeling trapped, but it’s not like we would easily go there to investigate,” Fuma added.</p><p>So there was indeed more to the story than just some friends teasing him about something which was actually quite logical.</p><p>“But he has Myuto to take care of him, so no worries,” Fuma added and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“But didn’t you say those two were troublemakers?”</p><p>“They are, but not towards each other,” Taiga said with a teasing smile, making Kentaro refrain from more questions.</p><p>***</p><p>Nikaido looked a bit worried over to the younger boys after Aran had stormed out the building followed by Myuto.</p><p>“Don’t mind them, that happens a lot,” Wataru soothed him.</p><p>“Back to the topic, what do you think?” Hiromitsu asked. The moment Hiromitsu had asked him if it was okay for him to send Kentaro out on a patrol his appetite had vanished.</p><p>“I don’t know. His ability is not that reliable yet, is it?”</p><p>“Well, it is pretty strong when he needs to protect himself or someone else, so as long as we don’t team him up with someone, he wouldn’t want to protect he should be completely fine,” Hiromitsu explained.</p><p>“And we would make sure to send at least two people with him at first and give him short patrols at daytime,” Massu added.</p><p>“Can’t I go with him?” Nikaido asked, but Wataru shook his head.</p><p>“We have a rule about family members not being allowed to go together, it’s just, you know, always a bit difficult with the judgment when you go with someone you care about too much.”</p><p>“We also watch out not to send out people together who have a too strong bond or can’t judge the situation right anymore if they are with a close friend,” Hiromitsu added.</p><p>“But someone like Taisuke seems to get emotional no matter who he is with? Aren’t you his best friend?” Nikaido asked after he had seen Taisuke with Wataru on a patrol before.</p><p>“Well, Taisuke is a special case, but most of the older ones were trained by the founders, so usually we’re all pretty good in judging the situation no matter who is with us.”</p><p>“The founders?” Nikaido asked.</p><p>“The village founders,” Massu explained. “They left the village in Hiromitsu’s care and traveled northwards about two years ago.”</p><p>“But there is nothing left northwards.”</p><p>“There are other Phenomenists,” Wataru said. “They try to find as many of them as possible. They created small communities to leave them with other leaders in the near future.”</p><p>Nikaido slowly nodded, but everyone was still looking at him and he finally let out a sigh. “Fine, he can patrol as soon as you think he is ready.”</p><p>Hiromitsu didn’t even ask what made him agree. Kentaro was fighting with Fuma over the last bread, while Taiga was laughing at them and cheering for Kentaro. It was definitely a bittersweet memory for Nikaido to see his little brother that lively.</p><p>“Great, I will make sure he stays safe,” Hiromitsu said.</p><p>“I have one condition though,” Nikaido said, making all three look at him. “You said he shouldn’t go with someone he didn’t want to protect.”</p><p>Hiromitsu understood immediately and nodded. “No worries I will make sure he is with the best people.”</p><p>“There is actually a second request we have,” Wataru suddenly said. Why didn’t he like the way they exchanged nervous looks on exactly that request? It was already the second time he felt like this and he feared that it would end the same way as before.</p><p>***</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Taisuke growled as they all met the next morning in the meeting hall to announce the new teams and he wasn’t the only one not happy about his team.</p><p>“Don’t think I am happy about this,” Nikaido replied with crossed arms to his chest.</p><p>“Then say you won’t go! Why are you and your brother part of the teams in the first place?” When Taisuke kept throwing his arms around as if he wanted to actually rip down the whole building, Hiromitsu stepped in between them. After all, Taisuke was known for a bad ability control so he could actually damage something or someone.</p><p>“This is a decision that has nothing to do with you, remember you were the one who said you don’t want any responsibility for the village, that is why you are not part of the council.”</p><p>Hiromitsu, Massu and Wataru were usually taking on the part of the council, while Taisuke had immediately said when they had formed it that he didn’t want to be part of it.</p><p>Taisuke pouted on all the scolding and crossed his arms to his chest making it hard for Taiga and Kentaro who were standing a bit in the back to not laugh at their older brothers as they looked exactly the same now. Both pissed and both behaving like children.</p><p>“And you are also okay with going out on patrol?” Taiga whispered towards Kentaro while Hiromitsu continued his scolding. Kentaro nodded, but couldn’t hide a nervous expression.</p><p>“If there is anything I can do for the village I want to try, even though I feel like I will be more of a burden at first.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, you have at least an ability, people usually complain when they have me on the team,” Taiga laughed off his weakness of fighting. “Not that I go often on patrols in the first place.”</p><p>“Okay everyone, listen up,” Hiromitsu finally said and everyone who was gathered stepped closer to the board in front where all their names and regions of the patrols were written down.</p><p>“We have two new members on our patrol teams, Nikaido and Kentaro,” Hiromitsu announced, but except for Taisuke no one seemed really annoyed by that announcement.</p><p>“So, to make it easier for them I will go through the basic explanation once more,” Hiromitsu said and gave Taisuke a warning look the moment he rolled his eyes. “We have three directions for patrols. Not more than three teams are allowed to go out at the same time so that we have enough people left at the village to protect it. The route itself can be chosen by the team. We have checkpoints like the waterfall which always need to be passed, but other than that the area around the district can be patrolled without a particular route, which is also to make sure that in the case someone spots someone on patrol they won’t be able to sneak around us because we are patrolling the same path every day.”</p><p>It made a lot of sense to Kentaro and he really wanted to know how the area around the village looked like. Until now he just knew the thick forest to the south.</p><p>“The most dangerous region to go is southwards, because the Eastern city is closest there. In the north there are no other cities left, so the north route is a spacious area, but usually the calmest. To the west the mountains aren’t as high and sometimes patrols from the city try to make their way northwards from there, so on that route you also have to watch out.”</p><p>Nikaido listened closely to everything, because no matter with whom he’d be out on patrol he would need to make sure he and the other people would stay safe.</p><p>“The team for the south will be Myuto, Massu and Fuma.”</p><p>“I get the chaos troop today,” Massu said with a sigh on which Fuma patted his back. “It’s okay I will make sure Myuto won’t be too annoying.”</p><p>Massu hit him on the back of his head on which Fuma pouted. “I am talking about you, idiot!”</p><p>Myuto couldn’t hide a chuckle, but Kentaro also didn’t necessarily want those two in his team for his first patrol.</p><p>“The north is going to Ryosuke, Kentaro and myself,” Hiromitsu announced. As it was already written on the board, they weren’t surprised, but earlier Taiga had explained that it was rare for Hiromitsu to leave the village in Wataru’s care, but because it was Kentaro’s first patrol he was obviously trying to make sure he’d be safe. After all, Ryosuke was one of their best Phenomenists and yet he joined as well.</p><p>“For the west route Nikaido and Taisuke will go.”</p><p>“Can’t you put someone else in the team? Even Aran would be fine,” Taisuke complained and Kentaro was sure that the ‘even Aran’ part would have made the boy freak, but luckily he wasn’t present. It was clear though that Myuto also didn’t like the way Taisuke talked about him and other Infirm most of the time, even though he was such good friends with Wataru.</p><p>“It’s enough if you get on the nerves of one person, trust me,” Wataru was the one to interfere. “Remember that the priority of any patrol is to come back safely. You don’t have to take any risks. All you need to do if you see soldiers from the city is to report back. If a fight is unpreventable make sure to protect each other.”</p><p>“As if he could even protect himself,” Taisuke growled, making Nikaido roll his eyes, but bit back a mocking comment about Taisuke’s bad ability control.</p><p>“Then off you go, be back before the sun reaches the peak of the mountain,” Hiromitsu warned them before they all got their bags with some proviant for the day.</p><p>“Be careful,” Nikaido said to his little brother and patted his shoulder. Kentaro gave him a faint smile and nodded.</p><p>“You too, and don’t rip each other apart,” Kentaro teased. Nikaido cracked a smile before he walked after Taisuke who was of course ready to leave without him if he didn’t hurry.</p><p>***</p><p>“Could you stop making this a competition?” Nikaido growled. Taisuke stopped so abruptly that Nikaido almost bumped into him.</p><p>“A competition? Against who, you?” Taisuke asked with a smirk. “You are an Infirm and not even good at fighting, there is no way you could ever compete against me.”</p><p>Nikaido rolled his eyes on that statement, but what else did he expect? “Whatever, just stop hurrying that much. I don’t think we need to dash through the forest like this, do we?”</p><p>They obviously didn’t have to, but Taisuke wanted to get over with their patrol as fast as possible. Without giving a reply Taisuke kept moving, but this time he finally started walking slower which made it easier for Nikaido to keep up with him. After all he didn’t know the surroundings and needed to watch out where to step to not stumble.</p><p>After a few more minutes in silence, they had reached a steep hillside with a pretty fast flowing river, meters under them.</p><p>“This is where we usually turn around,” Taisuke said, sounding pretty happy about half of the patrol being over. “There is no way to the other side, so all we do is check a bit up and down the river if anyone tried to somehow get over, but to be honest it’s almost impossible.”</p><p>“Well almost is still a good reason to check,” Nikaido said and he didn’t miss Taisuke’s annoyed look before he started moving alongside the river.</p><p>“Does each patrol route have something like this river or the waterfall we came though?” Nikaido asked as the silence started annoying him. It wasn’t like he liked small talk, especially with Taisuke, but there was also no reason to keep this moody atmosphere between them.</p><p>“It’s not like our village is inaccessible from all directions, that’s why we have patrols. You would have known that if you listened to Hiromitsu in the morning,” Taisuke started an almost normal conversation for once in a while with just a bit of cynic behavior. “We have our turn around spots, but especially from the south it’s always possible that some troops from the city could make it through the mountains without us noticing that’s why the south patrol is the most important one, towards the east side the cliff of the waterfall unfolds to a depth that it is impossible to access the village from the east, that is why don’t patrol much over there.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded on hearing that, because it made sense. Nikaido and Kentaro had made it through a part usually not taken by Infirm, so they wouldn’t check it as much as easier accessible paths.</p><p>“Did anyone from the city ever make it to your village? I mean those who didn’t seek shelter.”</p><p>The way Taisuke’s look darkened showed that he had understood the question the right way.</p><p>“There were, a long time ago,” Taisuke said, then he fell silent.</p><p>Nikaido knew this was already more information than Taisuke would usually give price towards an outsider. There was no meaning in trying to make him talk about it if he didn’t trust him. A few more minutes they walked in silence next to the river until Taisuke stopped.</p><p>“I guess we can head back towards the village from here.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded, already turning around, but when he realized that Taisuke wasn’t following him he waited. The older one was facing the river, his hands slightly clenched to fists.</p><p>“I want to make this clear,” he suddenly started, but didn’t turn around. “I don’t hate you or your brother. I have no personal grudge against any of you. But I trusted someone before and in the end I got betrayed, that leaves a lot of scars.”</p><p>There was nothing Nikaido could reply. It had been the most honest thing Taisuke had told him so far. It made him feel somehow relieved to see that he can actually show a weak side as well.</p><p>***</p><p>“Don’t be so concentrated all the time,” Ryosuke said and patted Kentaro’s shoulder on which he slightly flinched. “Look, you are way too tense for a patrol.”</p><p>“But aren’t we supposed to watch out for attacks and people sneaking around?”</p><p>Ryosuke couldn’t hide his laughter when Hiromitsu turned towards them, but then just kept moving with a smile.</p><p>“First, we have the northern route so not much to worry about, second even if someone is around, Hiromitsu would notice that before you could even decide if it’s a friend or foe.”</p><p>Ryosuke sounded pretty convinced by his own words, but no matter how awesome all their abilities were he still feared that if they didn’t watch out it could be a fatal mistake sooner or later.</p><p>“Okay, here let me distract you,” Ryosuke said and took his arm without a warning.</p><p>“Hey,” Kentaro said and ripped his arm out of his grip. “Why would you steal my abilities on a patrol?”</p><p>“Oh, you realized that fast,” Ryosuke said impressed. “I didn’t even have the time to get much of them.”</p><p>Kentaro kept pouting for a few more steps until they reached a part where they had to climb up a small stone area. Hiromitsu was waiting on top of it already and when Kentaro made it to the top without problems he finally raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, seems like someone learned a bit more about Power transfer?” Hiromitsu asked as Kentaro looked confused at his own hands.</p><p>“Why am I not feeling exhausted? The last time Taisuke accidently took my abilities I felt like collapsing.”</p><p>“That’s because Taisuke’s power transfer sucks and mine doesn’t,” Ryosuke said, Hiromitsu hitting him on the back of the head.</p><p>“You just learn quicker than him and now keep a look around, would you?”</p><p>Ryosuke hurried to the front of their group while Hiromitsu stayed with Kentaro this time.</p><p>“Taisuke can’t control his abilities well, so when he uses his power transfer it’s usually connected to his emotions which drags along the energy of the person together with the ability.</p><p>“But wait, does that mean you can drag actual life energy out of a human? Is that working with Infirm as well?”</p><p>It didn’t seem like Hiromitsu had heard this question for the first time, but he also didn’t seem to like answering it.</p><p>“You know when we train, we try not to hurt each other, but especially because we have Infirm training with us, accidents happen and sometimes they actually help us to learn more about our abilities.”</p><p>“So, you can actually draw energy from an Infirm, not just abilities from Phenomenists?” Kentaro asked directly this time and Hiromitsu had no other choice, but to nod.</p><p>“Yes, it is possible. It was Taisuke who did it by accident, but only Phenomenists with good power transfer control can actually divide if they want to draw energy or an ability.”</p><p>“So maybe it’s difficult for fire users, because they are hot headed?” Kentaro asked with a small smile on which Hiromitsu chuckled.</p><p>“That could be actually true,” Hiromitsu said.</p><p>Kentaro suddenly stopped as he got distracted and he tried to put a finger on what he was sensing. Why was he sensing something in the first place? Maybe it was a side effect through Ryosuke taking some of his abilities? Even when he stopped walking, Hiromitsu didn’t even seem to realize that something was wrong or was there even something wrong? Something made him turn his attention towards the western side of the patrol area.</p><p>“Kentaro, all good?” Ryosuke asked from the front on which Hiromitsu also finally stopped and turned.</p><p>There was no time to reply, because the ground was suddenly shaking and they all gasped as they saw half a mountainside collapse towards the west.</p><p>“What the hell?” Ryosuke asked in shock while Hiromitsu was already walking back towards Kentaro, but the boy wasn’t waiting for him. This was definitely no coincidence as the collapsed mountainside was on Nikaido and Taisuke’s patrol path.</p>

<p>Nikaido and Taisuke headed back over a pretty hard to walk on hillside and the neutral mood from before got slowly replaced by Taisuke's annoyed sighs each time he had to wait for Nikaido to keep up with him.</p><p>"If you don't want to wait it's fine," Nikaido said as he caught up. "I am just not used to walking on such dangerous steep sides of a mountain."</p><p>It wasn't in any way meant to sound offensive, but as always Taisuke's short temper made it hard for him to see it as calm as Nikaido.</p><p>"If I leave you behind I will get scolded and if you get hurt I also get scolded and here I was happy when Taiga was finally old enough to take care of himself."</p><p>"Are you comparing me to a child?" Nikaido asked irritated this time.</p><p>"Well, not much of a difference right now, is there? Newbies especially Infirms are always kind of slow."</p><p>"My apologies for not being as awesome as my brother," Nikaido snorted before he passed by Taisuke with fast steps and hit his shoulder against the other one on purpose.</p><p>"Would you at least make sure not to hurt yourself?" Taisuke asked as he followed. "Hey, I asked you something!"</p><p>Not even bothering turning around, Nikaido lifted his hand over his shoulder and flipped the other one off.</p><p>"Look, now that behavior is indeed pretty childish."</p><p>This time Nikaido had enough and he swirled around, taking Taisuke by full surprise as he grabbed him by the collar. "Why is it that you just have two moods? Freaking out about every little thing or playing victim?"</p><p>"Excuse me what? You don't really have an awesome emotional range either!"</p><p>With the next move Nikaido shoved the other one to the back and clicked his tongue. "At least I know how to act human."</p><p>It had sounded way worse than he had intended it to, but the damage had already been done. Taisuke's look darkened immediately and he dashed forward punching Nikaido so hard that the latter stumbled to the back and hurt his leg on a sharp rock.</p><p>"Say that again and I'll kill you!"</p><p>"Right, because you can easily do that," Nikaido mocked him before he tried to land a punch as well, but while Taisuke had thought Nikaido was an easy opponent he was taken off guard when Nikaido moved faster than expected and used the punch only for distraction before he landed a harsh kick on Taisuke’s ribs.</p><p>"Don't challenge your luck!" Taisuke growled as he didn’t back out this easily and eventually Nikaido grabbed Taisuke's arm after another attempt to punch and pulled him closer by the hair. "Try me."</p><p>A dangerous challenge for sure and with the next punch fire spread between them, Nikaido falling back with a yelp. Instead of feeling guilty though, Taisuke walked up to Nikaido and stood above him, lifting him up by the collar. "I have no problem getting rid of you if you become a threat to us."</p><p>The fire dancing around his raised fist was definitely proof enough of that, but Nikaido grabbed his wrist and pulled his arm away. "Don't talk so high and mighty. A fight is always between two after all! Maybe this attitude is why you got betrayed?"</p><p>Taisuke lunged out immediately, but Nikaido was still holding on to Taisuke's wrist so that he was able to bring the latter out of balance before he could cause any damage. When he had brought him to fall he sat on top of him and gave him a harsh punch which, judging by the sound, might have broken Taisuke's cheekbone.</p><p>Taisuke caught the other one’s wrist on his next try to punch him.</p><p>"You leave me no other choice," Taisuke hissed before he used his power transfer to drag enough energy from Nikaido so that he wouldn't be able to fight anymore.</p><p>"As If I'd let you!" Nikaido roared and tried to rip himself out of the other one's grip. "LET GO!"</p><p>When he couldn't break free and felt how he was about to collapse there was a change. It wasn't clear if it was Taisuke who had done something or not, but everything seemed to go reverse and the next second Taisuke's eyes widened as he also realized that something was off. The touch of Taisuke's hand burned like fire and with a yelp Taisuke was the one to let go, holding his hand in pain. "What did you do?"</p><p>But Nikaido didn't do anything, did he? His body felt like burning up though and his breaths got heavier and erratic.</p><p>When Taisuke tried to walk up to him he lifted his hand. "Don't come closer!" And he wouldn't be able to, because as impossible as it seemed with that hand movement a fire blast was released towards Taisuke who had to jump out of the way.</p><p>"What the hell?" Taisuke said in confusion while Nikaido was more in panic than just confused. He looked at his hands in sheer horror. He wasn't a Phenomenist. He was too old to even become one and those abilities didn't feel like his at all.</p><p>"I can't control them," Nikaido said in panic towards Taisuke who looked as lost as him. With a pained yelp Nikaido fell to his knees, folding in two through the sharp pain the ability inside of him caused.</p><p>"Release them!" Taisuke shouted, still not daring to get closer. "Let them break free, it might be the only chance to get rid of them."</p><p>Nikaido turned his head towards Taisuke with an unsure expression and for the first time Taisuke seemed to be able to read the atmosphere. "Don't worry I will make sure to get you back to the village. The abilities won't kill you as long as you get them out."</p><p>That was at least his theory. Something like this had never happened before, of course Nikaido could die and he would if he didn't get rid of the fire ability which didn't belong to him.</p><p>"Get out of reach," Nikaido hissed in between his painful gasps and Taisuke couldn't suppress an ironic chuckle.</p><p>"A minute ago we were ready to kill each other and by the way those abilities are mine so there is no way I'll let them kill me."</p><p>He had a point there and Nikaido had no more time to argue. With a deep breath he dared to spread his arms and the pain of the fire getting released made him feel like his body was getting ripped into half. He had his eyes closed, only hearing the fire blasts cutting through the rocks around him. Even his own screams were not audible between the sound of the cracking rocks and then the ground right underneath him gave in.</p><p>***</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>“Okay, let me rephrase this. What happened that you two ended up in such a mess?” Hiromitsu asked.</p><p>Things had gone terribly wrong from the moment Nikaido had released the fire which had threatened to kill him. In the end the whole hillside they had been on had collapsed and Taisuke had to use the rest of his strength to somehow keep them both protected from falling rocks and collapsing trees. End of the story was that Hiromitsu and the others had to dash over to their patrol path and luckily found them to bring them back to the village.</p><p>While Nikaido was still asleep, Miyata taking care of him, Taisuke had woken up after a few hours.</p><p>Now Massu, Wataru, Hiromitsu and Taisuke were at the meeting hall not allowing anyone else in for now. They needed to know what was going on first before the whole village would actually start panicking.</p><p>“I- we had a fight,” Taisuke finally started, leaning to the back.</p><p>“Well, we could have guessed that,” Wataru said resting his elbows on the table. “And?”</p><p>Taisuke remained silent on that question and looked nervously over to his older brother who was already guessing a lot through just that behavior.</p><p>“Taisuke, spill it. We already know you messed up, but for now we need to know what happened, because we don’t even know yet if Nikaido will recover. Miyata said that he is in the same state as a Phenomenist who used his abilities too much.”</p><p>“He did use abilities that’s the reason,” Taisuke replied, knowing already that everyone would give him disbelieving looks.</p><p>“How’s that?” Massu asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“They were my abilities, I guess…” Taisuke replied and as much as he would like to skip details he knew the questioning wouldn’t stop before they knew everything, so he retold the whole story, leaving them all staring at him in disbelief.</p><p>“So wait, you tried to draw out his energy and somehow Nikaido stole your abilities instead?” Wataru tried to understand what he had just been told.</p><p>“Pretty much yeah,” Taisuke said.</p><p>Hiromitsu had drifted off in a thoughtful state, but who were they kidding? None of them had any clue how this had happened.</p><p>“I know I told you not to use your abilities on Infirm if it’s not an enemy,” Hiromitsu started on which Taisuke sank more into the chair. “On the other hand, now that this happened, I need to make sure if this has something to do with you and your power transfer or if for example Fuma can do this too.”</p><p>“Oh god please not Fuma, who knows what will happen if someone gets his abilities? Taisuke’s abilities almost killed Nikaido, imagine what Fuma could do to an Infirm?” Massu let out. Taisuke was out of control, but Fuma’s abilities were extremely destructive as well.</p><p>“Exactly, that is why we need to know. Wataru, I have a request,” Hiromitsu said. “Would you mind trying the same power transfer with Taisuke?”</p><p>“Are you out of your mind?” Taisuke shouted, jumping up. “This was an accident, why would I do something like this to a friend?”</p><p>“Then what if it’s the next random person you get into a fight with? What if it’s Taiga?” Hiromitsu replied seriously and on the mention of their little brother, Taisuke finally fell silent.</p><p>“Don’t worry, now that you told us what happened I know at least that if it works all I have to do is to get the fire out. But maybe we should try this outside?”</p><p>“To be honest I fear this won’t work,” Taisuke interfered. “Nikaido realized what I was up to so he tried to stop me and I guess that is how this whole mess started. Even if we fake such a situation, I doubt it will work.”</p><p>***</p><p>Kentaro shifted nervously on the chair next to his brother's bed, but while Taisuke had been up without any problems earlier already there was no sign of his brother waking up so far.</p><p>"Don't worry if it's really like Miyata said then he will wake up eventually," Taiga tried to sooth him.</p><p>"But he isn't a Phenomenist so what if he can't heal?" Kentaro asked worriedly and there was no way Taiga, who was sitting at the other side of the bed in one of the wooden chairs, could take away that worry.</p><p>"I really hoped they could get along for a few hours. Guess we can't let them go on patrol again," Kentaro said with a sigh and fell back against the backrest.</p><p>"Or now we can finally let them go without worrying?"</p><p>Taiga's question made Kentaro tilt his head. "I mean think about it. Putting those two right away on a patrol was the best and worst idea at the same time."</p><p>Kentaro didn't really understand that logic on which Taiga tried to explain himself. "Mitsu let them go together even though he knew the worst could happen and it did. So what else could happen from now on if we let them go together?"</p><p>Finally Kentaro caught up to the younger one's thoughts and he nodded slowly.</p><p>"Well, I guess whatever happened made them learn their lesson?"</p><p>Taiga couldn't from smiling, because he thought exactly the same. They were all sure that there had been no attack even though they didn't know the details yet.</p><p>"Maybe from now on they will even get along better?" Taiga asked, making Kentaro chuckle.</p><p>The next moment their attention was drawn to Nikaido though as the latter finally moved.</p><p>"Are you awake?" Kentaro asked right away and jumped up from his chair.</p><p>It took a moment for Nikaido to move again and open his eyes. He looked pretty disoriented and who could blame him?</p><p>"You're in Miyata's hut. We brought you back," Kentaro explained.</p><p>Nikaido tried to sit up and Taiga moved to help him. When Kentaro reached out for his brother's arm as well Nikaido shifted a bit away. "It's okay."</p><p>"Do you remember what happened?" Taiga asked on which Nikaido took a moment to gather his thoughts before he gave a side glance to his little brother who seemed still way too worried.</p><p>"Not completely, but-" he raised his hands looking at them as if he feared for the same thing to happen again, but there was nothing. They were just his hands, his body also feeling completely normal.</p><p>"Where's Taisuke?" He asked instead of explaining more.</p><p>"He woke up a bit before you and is with Hiromitsu and the others," Taiga explained.</p><p>"You should rest some more," Kentaro said and reached out for his brother's hand. The emotion visible on his face when Nikaido pulled away was something Nikaido never wanted to cause, but for now he had to be careful.</p><p>"Do you remember why both of you passed out?" Taiga asked, trying to ignore the weird atmosphere.</p><p>"I am not sure. When we…" Nikaido's thoughts drifted off to the fight they had and he bit his lip. He was at fault for a lot of what had happened. And maybe it was better to let everyone know so that they could make sure it wouldn't happen to them. "When Taisuke-"</p><p>"When I lost control over my abilities in our fight, Nikaido tried to stop me from shredding the hillside into pieces, but he got caught up in my attacks. After that the hillside crumbled and I somehow tried to get us both away from the falling rocks. End of story, you're satisfied now?"</p><p>Taisuke’s sudden appearance in the room had them all turn to the door. Taisuke was leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed with the same annoyed expression as always.</p><p>“But that doesn’t explain-”</p><p>“Kentaro, why don’t we let your brother rest for a bit longer?” Taiga interrupted him and already walked away from the bed.</p><p>Kentaro gave him a confused look and then turned to his brother who nodded. “Don’t worry it’s not like I will go anywhere and you can come back later to check up on me.”</p><p>There was nothing else Kentaro could say, because all eyes were on him, waiting for him to leave. On his way out he gave Taisuke a side glance, but Taiga grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him out of Miyata’s hut before he could actually start any argument.</p><p>“Were you seriously planning on telling them the truth?” Taisuke asked as he shut the door and walked up to the bed, but didn’t sit down. Instead he leaned his back against the wall and gave Nikaido a scolding look.</p><p>“They are our brothers, why should we lie to them?”</p><p>“Did you think one second about how they will react?” Taisuke asked.</p><p>“It’s not like we even know what happened,” Nikaido hissed back, still feeling too exhausted to actually have another argument now.</p><p>“Exactly! So imagine me telling Taiga ‘oh by the way I might blow you up with my abilities the next time we have an argument and I touch you.”</p><p>Nikaido was ready to counter that they needed to trust each other, but then he remained silent and clenched his hands. Hadn’t he just done the same in reverse minutes ago? Nothing was clear yet, maybe it had something to do with Taisuke’s abilities or it was something about Nikaido, but exactly because he didn’t know he had kept his own brother away from him. Not because he was afraid of hurting him, but of getting hurt himself by another Phenomenist.</p><p>“Then what did you tell the others?” Nikaido asked after he got a grip again.</p><p>“Hiromitsu, Massu and Wataru know the truth, because there is no way I can hide this from them, but as expected we won’t easily figure out what happened. We just tried it with Wataru and as I thought nothing happened.”</p><p>“You tried to do this to your best friend?” Nikaido asked shocked, because no matter how much they don’t get along, he always saw Taisuke as a pretty protective person when it was about family and friends.</p><p>“Trust me I didn’t want to, but Hiromitsu insisted and Wataru said it was okay. In the end nothing happened though, because honestly I think this is something that can only happen when things are heated up on both sides.”</p><p>Which reminded Nikaido of their argument before everything escalated and he felt like crawling under his covers and hide. “You know at our argument, I didn’t realize how bad what I said sounded until I had already said it.”</p><p>Taisuke knew of course what part he was talking about, but he just shrugged his shoulders. “It’s not like you are the only Infirm out there saying stuff like that.”</p><p>“And that’s exactly what I didn’t want to say with it!” Nikaido interrupted him. “I know it totally sounded like a stupid Infirm judging a Phenomenist, but that’s not it. I love my brother over everything in the world and that didn’t change at all when he turned and I don’t judge people by who they are in matters of Infirm and Phenomenist. But... I judge people when they are assholes.”</p><p>At first Taisuke remained silent, then he slowly nodded and finally he looked up at the other one with wide eyes. “What?”</p><p>Without being able to help it, Nikaido bursted out laughing. Never had he expected Taisuke to show such a hilarious reaction. If he had caught up to what he had said immediately he would have definitely stormed out of the room or started another argument, but now all he could do was look super embarrassed.</p><p>With Nikaido finally getting in control of his laughter again Taisuke hawked and walked away from the wall. “Well, better an asshole than an inhuman monster I guess.”</p><p>“You definitely just showed the most human-like reaction there is,” Nikaido teased while Taisuke had already walked up to the door, not turning around to face him. “Thank you Taisuke and I am sorry.”</p><p>First there was just silence, but then Taisuke turned his head just a bit. “Be happy that your punch didn’t break my cheekbone or I wouldn’t accept that apology.”</p><p>Not waiting for a reply Taisuke left the room and even though Nikaido still had a faint smile on his face it faded slowly after that.</p><p>They had messed up big time and he had started the worst part of it and never again did he want to hurt someone’s feelings that bad just because they weren’t getting along. Now the question was just if they could change the tension between them.</p><p>***</p><p>“Where are we going?” Kentaro asked when Taiga dragged him not just out of the hut, but away from the village.</p><p>“You’ll see,” Taiga said with a smile as he finally let go of the other one, knowing he wouldn’t try to get back to his brother.</p><p>“Do you think they will be okay?” Kentaro asked after a few more moments of silence in which Taiga hummed and looked up to the sky.</p><p>“Usually my brother has just two moods. Either he becomes friends with you immediately or he will forever hate you.”</p><p>That didn’t sound like a positive reply and Kentaro let out a sigh on which Taiga patted his shoulder. “But don’t worry, I have the feeling this time it might be different.”</p><p>“Which part? Can he actually go from hating someone to wanting to kill that person?”</p><p>“Wow that pessimistic view is something you should be careful with, your abilities could suffer under it, you know?”</p><p>No, he didn’t know that, but that was his smallest problem.</p><p>“By the way, we are here,” Taiga finally announced after they had left the training ground behind them and reached a pretty huge rock, which was cracked at several parts.</p><p>“Did you use this for training as well?” Kentaro asked as Taiga already started climbing it and waved at Kentaro to follow him.</p><p>“Actually, this one is Taisuke’s fault,” Taiga replied with a chuckle as he sat down right at the center of the narrow top. The rock was several meters high so Kentaro took his time to climb after him to not fall.</p><p>“He blew it up?” Kentaro asked not even surprised.</p><p>“More or less yes. But as you can see it’s not like the usual damage his fire blasts would cause.”</p><p>After sitting down next to Taiga, Kentaro took a closer look and the cracks were indeed not what he would say was caused by a fire blast.</p><p>“The day this happened was a pretty dark one for all of us and with that day it started that Taisuke doubted people’s intentions.”</p><p>Kentaro replied with a nod in silence, because he didn’t miss the way Taiga’s expression turned serious.</p><p>“A friend betrayed him or more all of us and since then it had become hard for him to accept new people. Those who came after the betrayal were Myuto, Aran and Ryosuke, the others had been here before. It was really complicated at first to integrate Aran into the village.”</p><p>“Is the friend who betrayed you an Infirm?”</p><p>“He was an Infirm when he arrived. He then turned into a Phenomenist, but he talked about fellow Phenomenists as if they were monsters. Things started to get weirder when he wanted to convince them all to not use their abilities and then one day he actually asked Taisuke to go with him to the city to put an end to their misery.”</p><p>That was a pretty dark and also confusing story and Kentaro could understand how hard it would be for someone to trust others again after that, but there was definitely more to the story Taiga didn’t feel comfortable talking about yet. Other Phenomenists were also definitely hard to accept since then, but the chances to have Infirm coming from any city was also always there so letting people like Aran or also Nikaido and Kentaro stay was definitely always a risky decision.</p><p>“How sure are you that you can trust everyone in the village?” Kentaro dared to ask as he looked back at the small village with just a few lid fires in the tiny huts visible.</p><p>“Not sure at all,” Taiga replied honestly. “We were all like a family over all those years until that happening. It’s not like it happened from one day to the other and Taisuke had tried so much to stop him from, well, seeing them as monsters? But now he has shut himself out from personal feelings, all he can feel is rage. Putting effort into something or even someone just to get betrayed in the end is something he never wants to do again.”</p><p>It was understandable and yet it sounded like a really empty life, even though he had his siblings and close friends to support him.</p><p>“But who knows maybe this time he can finally put at least a tiny bit of trust in someone again?” Taiga asked with a small smile. Kentaro gave him a nod, because he really hoped that his brother was worth putting his trust into even though they started on really bad terms.</p><p>“Oh look,” Taiga said and pointed towards the sky. Kentaro followed his look, but didn’t find anything but the clear night sky. But after a few seconds he gasped.</p><p>“Shooting stars?”</p><p>“You didn’t really see any from the eastern city, did you?” Taiga asked now lying back on the rock to watch the beautiful night sky spectacle. Kentaro shook his head before he leant back and rested on his elbows on the rock to be able to look up better. “The city usually doesn’t even give a clear view of the sky with all the smoke the factories shoot into the air and to be honest there was no time to even think about something like watching the stars.”</p><p>“Lucky that you can do it now, because it is worth all your time,” Taiga said.</p><p>They remained silent for a while, both in their own thoughts while watching a few more shooting stars come and disappear in the same second. Their life seemed to change as fast as those shooting stars were disappearing. Each star bringing something new, good or bad wasn’t decided yet. After all the trouble in the first days in the village they had now finally made it to a point where people started trusting them more, but as Taiga had said they couldn’t be sure about anyone and who knew if they had to face another betrayal or an attack from the city at some point. So for now watching the night sky in this calm night really seemed like a privilege and he would enjoy every second of it.</p>

<h2 class="heading">A Bit Of Trust</h2>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Are you sure that you don’t need more rest?”</p><p>“Kentaro stop nagging, I am fine,” Nikaido assured him again. The day before he had indeed felt drained of all energy and yet he understood way better now how his brother and the others must feel after using their abilities.</p><p>When his brother looked a little bit down after the scolding he stopped and sighed before turning towards him and patted his shoulder. “I know you are still worried and I promise you that I will talk to Hiromitsu and the others later and see if we can find out what it was and if it will affect me from now on, okay?”</p><p>Immediately a small smile formed on Kentaro’s lips as he nodded. It was important to him after all that Nikaido wouldn’t take things too lightly. Whatever had brought that weird power transfer had split half a mountain apart, so who knew what could happen next time if they weren’t careful.</p><p>“You are late,” Fuma scolded Kentaro as he threw a fork towards his direction and Kentaro caught it with an apologizing smile. Fuma gave Nikaido a scanning look, but didn’t comment on anything before he waved Kentaro over to help with the field work.</p><p>Nikaido also got ready to help out when he spotted Taisuke carrying two bags of harvested grains. A few steps later one of the bags slipped from his shoulder and Nikaido automatically made a step to the front, but then he halted. Too many thoughts were bothering him. Not just about how he felt about the situation, but also how Taisuke felt about it. Then he shook his head, scolding himself before he started walking towards the other one.</p><p>“Let me carry it,” Nikaido said as he grabbed the bag before Taisuke could try and get it up while balancing the second one still on his shoulder. First Taisuke gave the other one a confused expression, eyes a bit too wide to even call it confused, more like shocked and it made Nikaido feel a bit uncomfortable, but he still lifted the bag up and threw it over his shoulder.</p><p>Taisuke needed a moment to move and he tried to keep his expression neutral as he kept walking next to Nikaido. They didn’t talk while putting the grain bags into the storage room, but when Taisuke handed his bag to him and Nikaido accidently touched his hand, Taisuke pulled away immediately, letting the bag drop to the ground.</p><p>Both kept staring at the bag, a weird silence spreading between them as they gave each other doubtful looks.</p><p>“We really need to do something about this,” Nikaido finally said and while it wasn’t clear at first if Taisuke even wanted to bother he actually nodded after a moment.</p><p>“But I don’t know what to do,” Taisuke let out in a low voice.</p><p>“It’s because you usually go head first through every possible wall to solve things,” Nikaido explained and Taisuke didn’t even get angry, showing that he indeed felt troubled. “But luckily I know what we can do.”</p><p>Taisuke gave him a skeptical look on the other one’s confident smile, but for now he would try almost everything if it meant he could keep the people around him safe, especially Taiga.</p><p>***</p><p>“Is that a good or bad sign?” Ryosuke asked as some of them had already gathered for the afternoon training as he spotted Taisuke and Nikaido walking down towards them.</p><p>“Well, they are not yelling at each other so I think we’re safe?” Myuto laughed.</p><p>Taisuke walked up right to Wataru who already gave him a knowing look.</p><p>"We'll train together," Taisuke said straight forward and pointed at Nikaido. "But I need to ask a favor for that."</p><p>"Let me guess you want to train with Nikaido, but because you know whatever happened before won't work without a real threat you need the others to help you out, but you don't want to put them in danger."</p><p>Of course his friend had already understood his request and while Taisuke still looked unsure about his own idea, Wataru waved some of them over.</p><p>"We actually already discussed this as I thought you'd sooner or later come and ask. Massu and Ryosuke will train with you."</p><p>"And I will as well."</p><p>Taisuke turned around and immediately shook his head when Hiromitsu walked up to them.</p><p>"You know that I won't fight seriously against you," Taisuke said.</p><p>"Don't worry about that, trust me I will make you fight for your life if needed," Hiromitsu said and his serious look showed that he wasn't in any way joking.</p><p>"Leave the training of the others to me. You go and do whatever it takes to find out what happened."</p><p>Nikaido also gratefully nodded at everyone's support, but he was also as nervous as Taisuke, because he feared things would escalate again. But if they wanted to know if it could happen again they needed to try. Especially because Miyata had explained that maybe, just a tiny maybe, Nikaido could control those abilities, but they had to test it the hard way if they wanted to find out. If he succeeded then that could mean that whatever was going on didn’t just come from Taisuke, but made Nikaido somehow a Phenomenist as well. A passive unknown type until now, without any direct active abilities.</p><p>"Okay, then let's start. You get five minutes."</p><p>"Five minutes for what?" Nikaido asked with a raised eyebrow at Hiromitsu.</p><p>"To run," Massu explained.</p><p>"And then we will hunt you down and trust me when I say we'll all go for real after you. Better put your mind on enemy mode, because this is no game," Hiromitsu added seriously. They had decided on this method to make it realistic for them and to also keep them away from the village.</p><p>Nikaido gave Taisuke an unsure look, but then the older one nodded. "Fine, then come at us like we're your enemies, but I can't guarantee that the same thing won't accidentally happen to you."</p><p>"That's why we try this, right?" Ryosuke said with a challenging smile.</p><p>Nikaido wondered for a moment if it wasn't better to have Nikaido fight against him and not have him on the same team as the first time the power transfer happened was when they had a fight and this time all their opponents were Phenomenists, but maybe this was the safest start for them all.</p><p>"What is going on?" Kentaro was heard when he came running towards the training ground with Taiga when they saw everyone gathered.</p><p>"We're going to do a training exercise outside the village. Don't worry, we'll be back by nightfall," Nikaido explained and no one added any more details even though Kentaro looked more than skeptical.</p><p>"We'll take care of them," Hiromitsu said and put his hand on Kentaro's shoulder.</p><p>"Five minutes from now," Massu said and Taisuke gave Hiromitsu another brief look before he told Nikaido to follow him towards the forest.</p><p>"This is more than just a harmless training exercise, isn't it?" Taiga asked his older brother, making sure that Kentaro wouldn't hear them.</p><p>"It's Taisuke's request and I promise we'll bring them back in the evening."</p><p>"Bring them back, so chances are high that they can't walk back on their own. You know that Kentaro will scold you big time if you hurt Nikaido right after that recent incident."</p><p>"It's exactly because of what happened that we need to find out more about it, but don't you think it's better to get the backlash from Kentaro later than now?" Hiromitsu asked with a smile and Taiga sighed, but then nodded.</p><p>"Fine, but make sure to apologize to him later if his brother really gets hurt. I already guessed that you’re hiding something from us, but at least take responsibility for it."</p><p>"So you're not worried for your own brothers?" Hiromitsu teased.</p><p>"Taisuke always gets hurt and I doubt I ever have to worry about you," Taiga said when Massu told them to start following the other two. When Hiromitsu turned away, Taiga grabbed him by the sleeve. "But still, don't overdo it, okay?"</p><p>Hiromitsu gave him a small chuckle on that reaction and ruffled through his hair. "Don't worry, we're a tough family, right?"</p><p>Taiga looked after them with a troubled expression, but when he saw how Kentaro tried to play down his worries too as he had definitely realized that they were keeping secrets from him, Taiga pushed him towards Aran and Myuto.</p><p>"Let's train? Now that all the troublemakers are out of the village, we can for once train without accidents."</p><p>"And all the focus will be on you, so don't think this will be easy training," Wataru said from the side with a lopsided smile.</p><p>***</p><p>"Slow down," Nikaido finally said when Taisuke kept jumping up some steep rock side.</p><p>"They will immediately find us if we don't hurry."</p><p>"It's not like we're playing hide and seek. How about we make a plan about where to hide so we can try to attack them first?"</p><p>Nikaido's idea was good, but Taisuke was bad at teamwork, but what was new?</p><p>“That’s easier said than done and you’re not really of much help when fighting.”</p><p>"If you want to pick another fight go ahead, then we'll just end up like last time," Nikaido said and that actually changed the older one's expression.</p><p>"Fine, then let's look for a higher ground and we need to put a fake track, but Mitsu is really good at realizing stuff like that so maybe two fake tracks are better. One obvious one and one that seems like we tried to hide it."</p><p>"Great, you do that and I'll try to find a good hiding spot," Nikaido said and kept walking up to the highest point of the rocky surface from where a waterfall was visible from a steep cliff they couldn't possibly climb.</p><p>"I warn you all the people who are after us won't show us any mercy. With us accepting this training we have to be ready for a real fight. Don't come crying because you broke something," Taisuke reminded him while he started with the fake track.</p><p>Nikaido only rolled his eyes while he kept looking for a good hiding place.</p><p>"They can sense you, right?" Nikaido asked when Taisuke came back to create the second fake trail.</p><p>"It's not like we can sense a direct location, but we know when Phenomenists are around."</p><p>"That's how Kentaro was drawn to your village," Nikaido realized. "But won't they realize then when they go on the fake trail?"</p><p>"They might," Taisuke said and then turned around, obviously realizing that the others were catching up. "But there is a way to confuse them."</p><p>"What way?"</p><p>Nikaido regretted his question the moment Taisuke looked back at him with a teasing smile and suddenly pushed him to the back. The waterfall was next to them and the rocks they were standing on ended on a steep end, under it the river flowing at a slow pace.</p><p>What Taisuke obviously hadn't seen coming though was Nikaido reaching out for the front of his shirt at the last second and pulling him down with him into the river.</p><p>"How often do you want to try and kill me?" Nikaido yelled as they both broke through the surface again.</p><p>In reply Taisuke shoved some water into the other one's face. "A fall into water won't kill you."</p><p>Nikaido growled at that comment, but Taisuke grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the waterfall. "Hurry, they are almost here."</p><p>"We can't even fight down here," Nikaido complained, but followed Taisuke towards the waterfall where they dived under it and found a small hiding spot in the water on the other side.</p><p>"We don't need to fight. They can't see us, hear us or sense us here," Taisuke explained. "Kentaro would be able to, but there is no one with water abilities and as a fire user the water blocks my abilities."</p><p>"Wait, so you can't use your abilities inside the water?" Nikaido asked.</p><p>Taisuke lifted his fist, but only a small flame appeared and it vanished after a few seconds.</p><p>"There are some fire users who can use their fire even underwater, but it drains me of my abilities and as you know I am not the best with controlling my fire."</p><p>"But the others know that, right? Won't they try and look here?"</p><p>"They don't think of me as someone who would hide," Taisuke said.</p><p>"You mean they don't expect you to come up with such a good idea, not that half of it wasn't mine," Nikaido replied teasingly.</p><p>Taisuke shoved some water in his face for that comment, but Nikaido only laughed, not feeling like picking a fight over this topic.</p><p>"So how long are we supposed to wait here? I don't think they planned this as a hide and seek with us winning if we hide long enough."</p><p>"They will realize the fake track quickly so the moment they pass us we need to plan a surprise attack," Taisuke said.</p><p>"Against three Phenomenists? How are we supposed to surprise them?"</p><p>Taisuke's lopsided smile made Nikaido already regret his decision to join this training. He just knew that Taisuke would come up with some ridiculous and dangerous idea.</p><p>***</p><p>"Then let's see if water can beat fire," Fuma challenged while Wataru made them train by themselves, a good exercise to find out how far they were allowed to go in training, something Fuma was extremely bad at.</p><p>Taiga was training with Aran and Myuto under Wataru's supervision, giving them a jealous look from time to time.</p><p>"If you space out I will immediately win," Fuma reminded him and Kentaro made sure to step closer to the small stream behind him.</p><p>Fuma didn't waste any time and attacked straight on with a fire blast and Kentaro used the water to block it, but the smoke rising through that had given Fuma the perfect cover to jump at Kentaro, bringing him to fall. But Kentaro wouldn't lose that easily as he had learned some helpful moves from Hiromitsu and Wataru so with a swift movement he twisted to the side and used his legs to make it difficult for Fuma to breath.</p><p>Yet he had to let him go the moment he realized the other one was forming another fire blast.</p><p>"Almost good. Next time add some water to your move?"</p><p>"It's not like getting us drowned under a wave will help," Kentaro teased, but Fuma shook his head.</p><p>"Did you ever try something different?"</p><p>"Different how?"</p><p>Fuma showed him instead of telling him and Kentaro gasped when Fuma used the fire in his hand and formed a bridge of fire between both of his hands before he let it go from one hand like a whip, making Kentaro jump out of the way.</p><p>"I didn't know fire users could do this," Kentaro said impressed.</p><p>"Not all of us can. Taisuke is too unconcentrated to actually learn anything new and Massu has his own special techniques. Maybe it's time to push you some more so you can find yours."</p><p>Kentaro wanted to complain that if he was under too much pressure, he might not be able to even think about something, but Fuma already went for his next attack and this time he was indeed not going easy on him, but he also pushed Kentaro away from the stream, making the other one panic.</p><p>"Don't rely on your abilities too much," Fuma warned him as he hit a really good hook on Kentaro's face the next second, making the boy fall to the back. When he put his hand down to get up, he realized that they had moved so much towards the side of the training ground that the rocky surface had changed to grass and it was slightly wet as it had rained the night before.</p><p>In his thoughts Kentaro almost missed the fire blast coming at him or more like he had indeed been too slow this time and unfortunately the others hadn't realized it so no one was able to redirect it.</p><p>"Kentaro, move!" Fuma yelled at him, but all Kentaro could do was cross his arms in front of his face and while the stream was too far away to use its water, he felt like his hands tried to protect him with the usual water wall, but then the fire blast hit him straight on.</p><p>"Kentaro!" Taiga was heard from the back as they had finally realized what had happened and he dashed past Fuma as the boy was unable to move, afraid of the damage he had caused.</p><p>"Myuto, call Miyata," Wataru shouted at Myuto and Aran as he made it over to the boys as well.</p><p>“No need for that,” Taiga said as he reached Kentaro and stopped with a relieved yet confused expression.</p><p>"What happened?" Kentaro asked as he looked down his arms, which were miraculously unhurt.</p><p>"You tell us. We didn't see what happened," Taiga said.</p><p>"I tried to form a wall as usual, but the stream was too far away, but I feel like I succeeded? It felt like the one time the water connected to my skin."</p><p>Everyone exchanged a confused look before Fuma sank to his knees with a long sigh.</p><p>"Whatever you did, I'm happy you did it, because your brother would have killed me if I had burned your arms."</p><p>"But now we have to figure out how you did it. Not that we figured it out last time. This time we need to find out where you got the water from." Wataru said with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"Can we do that after a break?" Kentaro asked as he was still a bit shaken about what had happened and luckily the others all agreed that it was time for a break.</p><p>***</p><p>A stone dropped from the side of the cliff, making a lot of noise until it reached the bottom.</p><p>"You're of no use," Taisuke scolded the other one.</p><p>"Right, as if Phenomenists were ghosts and make no noise," Nikaido hissed back. "Do you even have any plan where we are going?"</p><p>"Of course I do," Taisuke said as he kept moving up towards a steep rocky surface, but for Nikaido it wasn't that easy especially because his clothes were still wet and his shoes kept slipping, while Taisuke as a fire user was able to dry himself easier and of course he had said they didn't have enough time to make him help Nikaido to get dry.</p><p>"But if you don't hurry, we won't make it," Taisuke said and the only reason he held his hand out towards the other one was so that Nikaido would hurry up. With a growl the younger one took his hand and let himself get dragged up. Taisuke urged him to stay low as they reached the highest point.</p><p>"I made sure they'd follow this fake track so they will make it back this path soon."</p><p>"You don't want us to jump down from here, do you?" Nikaido asked startled as they were several meters above the path below.</p><p>"I can throw you? It would be a perfect surprise attack," Taisuke teased, making the other one roll his eyes in annoyance.</p><p>"I'll use my fire blasts from here while you can roll those rocks down," Taisuke said, pointing at a handful of extremely heavy looking rocks. "Remember most of them are telekinesis users, they can easily stop them."</p><p>"Right, so what do we do after they stop them?"</p><p>Taisuke stayed silent on that question while he kept looking down to the path, then looked at the rocks and back at Nikaido.</p><p>"You didn't think this through, did you?"</p><p>"I didn't have much time to make a plan, okay?"</p><p>"You know that we had enough time to set traps for them instead of going up here?" Nikaido asked back, making Taisuke snort.</p><p>"Then why didn't you come up with that earlier?"</p><p>"You didn't ask!" Nikaido hissed back. "You always run head first into every dangerous situation, thinking all Infirm are just in your way. Newsflash, we have ideas too and some might be better than yours."</p><p>Taisuke got up with a pissed expression as he was as always unable to take criticism, but Nikaido stopped him on the shoulder. "You want to run away now? We decided on this training, so let's go through with it. All we will do is lose in the end, no big deal."</p><p>"Then fight them alone," Taisuke complained and slashed the other one's hand away. But the next second Nikaido tackled him down, making Taisuke yell at him even more, but then he heard how a huge rock landed right next to them.</p><p>"You're so loud, we could hear you kilometers away," Ryosuke teased as he had kicked a heavy rock off and had used his telekinesis to throw it towards them. "Taisuke, you should thank Nikaido. He has better reflexes than you."</p><p>"Whatever," Taisuke hissed as he shoved Nikaido away and immediately formed a fire blast to shoot it at Ryosuke while Nikaido tried to spot the other two.</p><p>"You really want to do that?" Ryosuke asked, but of course Taisuke had already released the blast, which then changed directions and went directly for Nikaido. He had been able to jump away, but with the rocky surface he couldn't find a good foothold to move fast.</p><p>"Told you," Ryosuke said with a lopsided smile.</p><p>Nikaido pulled Taisuke back on the arm when he wanted to go for a frontal attack and for once he halted when Nikaido whispered something. Taisuke nodded, but then he still dashed to the front.</p><p>"No teamwork after all?" Ryosuke asked, but when Taisuke jumped away Ryosuke had to duck away from a stone flying towards his direction and the next one Nikaido was throwing was way heavier and Ryosuke used his telekinesis to block it, but then a fire blast appeared right next to him, forcing him retreat as he couldn't use his telekinesis on such a high speed between two directions.</p><p>"Oh, interesting idea," Ryosuke said proudly on their first actual teamwork. They kept that technique for a while until Taisuke celebrated too early as he thought he had finally gotten Ryosuke. But the fire blast stopped midair before it got thrown back at him.</p><p>"Nice idea, but with more people it might not be that helpful," Hiromitsu was heard as he had used his abilities from down the cliff.</p><p>"At least we tried," Taisuke hissed.</p><p>"Wait, that's it. You're out of ideas?" Ryosuke asked, a bit perplexed.</p><p>"You're surprised?" Hiromitsu asked with a smirk.</p><p>"It's not like you'd really try to kill us and I didn't have enough time to think of something," Taisuke complained.</p><p>"No time in the world would be enough for you," Ryosuke laughed. "But you're also wrong."</p><p>"With what?" Taisuke asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"We told you that we're serious and we meant it," Ryosuke said and the next second the entire stone wall next to Nikaido burst into fire and crumbled under him, leaving him in shock yet unable to do anything as there was nothing to hold on to.</p><p>"NIKA!" Taisuke immediately jumped after him, fast enough to catch his hand and somehow hold on to some remaining sharp stones, cutting his arm badly on that move. Before he could even say anything the stone construction he was hanging on to was also breaking off and he desperately looked for a way to get them both out of the situation, but then he couldn't hold on to Nikaido anymore.</p><p>At the last second, he realized that something felt different in his touch, but the panic in the other one's eyes was still clearly visible when they both fell down the cliff. Taisuke knew he could save himself, but without telekinesis he wouldn't be able to help Nikaido, yet there was no need for it as Nikaido somehow moved more precisely the moment he had realized the same familiar change. But this time he was able to use the energy to his advantage in his panic and he moved as fast as Taisuke and they both managed to somehow avoid the falling stones and slow down their fall with some precise jumps off the remaining cliff wall.</p><p>The entire scenario had barely taken more than a handful of seconds, but when Taisuke hit the ground a bit too rough, he could hear how Nikaido had definitely hurt himself through the impact as well as he wasn't used to the abilities of a Phenomenist. It wasn’t like their physical strength would increase much, but Phenomenists were known to be able to react faster and smoother in dangerous situations.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Taisuke asked as he dashed over to him, but to his surprise he got shoved away the next second and Nikaido also jumped away when another fire blast made it towards them and was then redirected to Nikaido.</p><p>"You'll kill him!" Taisuke roared as he realized that Massu and Hiromitsu had waited for them.</p><p>Nikaido had no time to even doubt that he could do what he felt he was able to do and he put his hands to the front and a fire blast of his own collided with the other one, making the fire vanish into a smoke cloud.</p><p>"What the hell," Taisuke let out in shock and then shook his head before he took a run up at his older brother and took him by the collar.</p><p>"And here you call me reckless? What the hell were you thinking?"</p><p>Hiromitsu gave his brother a calm expression, waiting for him to calm down and luckily he let go of him to see if Nikaido was okay.</p><p>"What happened?" Nikaido asked, still overwhelmed by the situation, sitting on the ground unable to get up.</p><p>"The same as before with the difference that you somehow made use of my abilities. We can be lucky that you're alive," Taisuke said and tried to pull the other one up from the ground, but then hissed when he finally realized that he had hurt himself.</p><p>"We told you this wasn't a game," Ryosuke said as he had made it down to them.</p><p>"But you were safe the entire time," Hiromitsu explained, making Taisuke want to explode again, but Nikaido held him back, because of his arm injury.</p><p>"If Nikaido hadn't been able to use your abilities then I would have caught him with my telekinesis, Ryosuke could have interfered too," Hiromitsu explained.</p><p>"So hurting your brother in the process is okay?"</p><p>It took Hiromitsu off guard that Nikaido was speaking up for Taisuke, but he had a point after all.</p><p>"That's on me I guess, sorry for that," Massu said apologizing as he had used his fire to crush the cliff without even thinking about looking out for Taisuke.</p><p>"Well at least we got some results? Let's get back for now, it's getting dark," Ryosuke said and luckily Nikaido seemed to have gathered his thoughts enough to push Taisuke ahead before he could pick a fight with his older brother. Taisuke kept complaining that he was fine, but Nikaido was already using the vest he had been wearing to somehow help stopping the bleeding of Taisuke’s arm injury.</p><p>"They will have a lot to figure out on their own from here," Hiromitsu said with a faint smile while the other two kept quarrelling on their way back, so busy with each other that they hadn’t even realized that Nikaido had not taken any heavy damage this time even though he had used the active abilities of a Phenomenist.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga left towards the village after Wataru had called it a day for their training, but before he could follow the others, Kentaro pulled him away from the group.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>Kentaro signaled him to stay quiet and follow him away from the village.</p><p>"You're not going to try and go after our brothers, are you?" Taiga asked, but Kentaro gave him a smile.</p><p>"It's still not completely dark so I'll trust them for now. But I want to go somewhere else."</p><p>Taiga gave him a skeptical look, but still followed him towards the forest and soon the river, the main source for their small streams, came into their sight.</p><p>"And now?"</p><p>"And now we train," Kentaro said.</p><p>"But we already trained."</p><p>"No, I did. You didn't."</p><p>Kentaro's words made Taiga give him a proud look. "You noticed, didn't you?"</p><p>Kentaro nodded as he had of course realized that Wataru made Taiga train way less than the others. He was handled with kid gloves through the position of his oldest brother, but Kentaro had realized that he didn't feel in any way happy about that.</p><p>"And I still have to figure out how I managed to build that water armor around me so we can help each other," Kentaro challenged and Taiga was more than happy to take that offer. "But we should make sure not to get too overboard or the others will scold us."</p><p>"We can help you with that."</p><p>The sudden interruption made both of them turn when Aran, Myuto and Fuma walked up to them.</p><p>"Well, except for Fuma. He might go overboard even more," Myuto added.</p><p>"Won't you get into trouble for this?" Kentaro asked.</p><p>"Not more than you," Fuma laughed. "And I really want to see that water armor again."</p><p>"Jealous?" Kentaro joked.</p><p>"Who knows maybe we can find even more new abilities this way," Myuto said thoughtfully.</p><p>"Are we going to make this a survival of the fittest kind of training like your brothers do so that you have to activate new abilities?" Aran asked a bit worried.</p><p>"Not for now," Taiga soothed him. "I'd say we'll get scolded enough if they find out that we're training on our own, but I think a bit of extra training will help all of us."</p><p>"Then let's get ready for some unsupervised ass kicking," Fuma yelled in excitement and they all exchanged an excited look.</p><p>***</p><p>It had turned completely dark outside by the time Taisuke and the others made it back to the village and they hurried towards the meeting hall, knowing that the others were waiting for them there.</p><p>The moment they opened the doors the boys jumped up from their chairs and while Kentaro jumped directly into Nikaido's arms who lifted him up from the ground to squeeze him even more, Taiga stopped in front of Taisuke and Hiromitsu with a scolding look towards Taisuke's arm.</p><p>"I guess you can be happy that it's you who got hurt and not Nikaido," Taiga let out scolding.</p><p>"It's not like we promised that no one would get hurt and it's just a small cut," Taisuke said before he walked past Taiga towards Wataru to talk about the upcoming patrols for the next day.</p><p>Everyone from their group except for Hiromitsu also walked towards the others in the room, Fuma and the boys already asking how it went while trying hard to hide their own small injuries they had caused through their extra training.</p><p>"Are you really okay?" Kentaro asked when Nikaido stepped back.</p><p>"I'm feeling cold and tired, but this time I'm fine, yes."</p><p>“So will you finally tell us the truth?” Kentaro asked and Nikaido gave Hiromitsu a knowing look and the older one sighed.</p><p>“I bet you already guessed a lot, but yes there is more to the story than Taisuke just losing control over his power transfer. He can transfer his abilities to Nikaido and he can use those abilities.”</p><p>“Wait, you’re a Phenomenist?” Kentaro asked, not knowing if he felt relieved or not about that information. Nikaido could only shrug his shoulders though as he didn’t seem to have any active abilities of himself.</p><p>“But can Taisuke do the same with others?” Taiga asked.</p><p>“I am not even sure if this comes from Taisuke,” Hiromitsu said and looked at Nikaido. “But for now we can just see how it goes. Miyata thinks that Nikaido might have had a passive power transfer for some years already, but was never aware of it.”</p><p>“Then you could steal my abilities too?” Kentaro asked, making Hiromitsu look at the younger one in slight worry as he had thought about that possibility as well, but then he shook his head.</p><p>“We actually tried that out,” Nikaido explained as the same question had come up on their way back, but Nikaido couldn’t even feel anything like a power transfer ability and at least in a calm situation he hadn’t been able to get any ability from anyone else. Ryosuke had even tried to use his power transfer to see if Nikaido could reverse it.</p><p>“It might be a bit more complicated to understand the details then,” Taiga let out, but seemed relieved that they finally knew what was going on.</p><p>"Come, let's sit and eat for now. I bet you're more exhausted than you want to say," Kentaro said, knowing that his brother wanted to stay strong in front of the others, but he looked even more exhausted after he sat down.</p><p>"I'll ask if we're having a patrol tomorrow too," Taiga said and excused himself for a moment.</p><p>"So you really used a Phenomenist's ability today?" Kentaro asked while Nikaido took some food from the plate for now.</p><p>"More or less. I would have gotten badly hurt without his abilities, not that Hiromitsu didn't have a backup plan to help me in the worst case," he added before Kentaro could get angry at their rough methods. “How did your training go by the way?"</p><p>"It was okay," Kentaro said, but when he remained silent Nikaido gave him a knowing look.</p><p>"Do I need to ask the others?"</p><p>Kentaro sighed on that question, but then shook his head. "We discovered some new ability I can use, but I can't figure out how I did it so I don't really want to talk about it yet. I didn’t even figure out the last thing I did, I can’t deal with anything new right now."</p><p>"Fine with me, but don't be reckless just so you can master it immediately. Taisuke and I will need time with whatever is going on and you can also take as much time as you need with your training."</p><p>Nikaido ruffled through his little brother's hair, finally turning Kentaro's slightly gloomy expression into a brief smile.</p><p>Their secret training had not shown any results on his side for now, but at least Taiga got to train a bit more seriously for once in a while and they had already decided to continue their extra training as often as they could.</p>

<p>“Hana, be careful with that,” Taiga said when the little girl started playing with one of the rakes on the fields, while her brother tried to lift up one of the rice bags.</p><p>“That’s a bit too heavy for you little man,” Myuto said and held out a smaller bag to the boy. “Want to trade?”</p><p>The boy immediately took the bag from him and told his sister to follow him to the storage.</p><p>“They’re growing up so fast,” Taiga said as he remembered the times when they were only crybabies and Miyata had his hands full with them every single day.</p><p>“There are others also finally growing up,” Myuto said, making Taiga laugh.</p><p>“Don’t you mean growing a bond here?”</p><p>“They behaved quite childish until now,” Myuto said as he looked over to Nikaido and Taisuke who were finally back to helping out in the village again after another day of rest.</p><p>Myuto squealed when cold water hit him on the side of his face, Taiga grinning at him with a teasing smile. “You can be quite childish too, don’t forget that.”</p><p>“Says the one splashing water at me,” Myuto pouted and kicked up some water at Taiga who laughed.</p><p>These calm days were what he treasured the most and what he wanted to be their everyday life, but reality had hit him hard enough several times before so he would take every single calm moment as a precious one and never for granted.</p><p>“If you have so much fun getting water over your heads, ask Kentaro to help you out,” Taisuke shouted from the side as he and Nikaido were bringing some rice bags in. Taiga stretched his tongue out towards his brother, but kept laughing.</p><p>“That’s not a quantity of water I want emptied over me,” Myuto said as he looked around, but luckily Kentaro was training with Massu so he could rest assured not to get a waterfall shower.</p><p>Nikaido stepped to the side when Miyata’s kids ran out of the storage and dashed down to the huts, squealing and laughing.</p><p>“What are you smiling at? Never saw kids playing?” Taiuske asked as he put his rice bag down and waited for Nikaido to hand him the one he was carrying.</p><p>“In the city there is not much laughter left, you know,” Nikaido said, but his expression stayed positive. “I haven’t seen my little brother laugh this much in years.”</p><p>Taisuke didn’t know what to reply so he only nodded, but Nikaido was lost in his thoughts now, making Taisuke snap his fingers.</p><p>“Nikaido, give me your bag. We don’t have the entire day for this.”</p><p>The one in question turned back to Taisuke, but his look had turned to confused.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nika.”</p><p>Taisuke tilted his head, still not understanding what he meant.</p><p>“You called me Nika before, why are you going back to formal now?”</p><p>“I never called you that. Why would I call you that?” Taisuke asked as he snatched the bag away from Nikaido who gave him a teasing look now.</p><p>“Pretending to not remember, mh? Fine with me, Gaya.”</p><p>Taisuke almost lost his balance when he put the rice bag on the top shelf and stumbled half to the back, facing Nikaido with such a confused look that the younger one burst out laughing.</p><p>“You know, I just found it fair. You call me Nika, then I call you Gaya.”</p><p>“I won’t call you Ni-”</p><p>“Whatever. Let’s go, Gaya. We have a lot of work left for the day.”</p><p>Taisuke just blinked at the other one dumbfounded as he walked out back to the fields with a satisfied smile on his face, but when he turned back, Taisuke immediately pointed at him.</p><p>“Don’t say it again. I warn you,” Taisuke yelled before he ran after Nikaido and this time the other one started running away from him, repeating his new found nickname.</p><p>“Nika, I swear I make you pay for that ridiculous name,” Taisuke yelled after him, not even realizing how naturally he used his own nickname for the other one already.</p><p>***</p><p>Unable to think of any other move, Kentaro let himself drop into the river behind him after Massu had cornered him at their training and it was difficult enough for him to dodge Massu’s fire blasts, but Ryosuke had joined the training and kept stopping his movements and redirecting the fire blasts, so when he couldn’t focus enough on his own abilities he just took the easiest way out.</p><p>“For others that would have been suicide,” Ryosuke said when Kentaro got out of the water a few meters downstream.</p><p>“Why? Can no one of you swim?” Kentaro asked, tilting his head.</p><p>“As expected from a water user,” Massu said with a laugh. “Look at that fast flow of the river. You didn’t even fear getting dragged along or hit a rock. You trust the water, that’s a really good sign for getting your abilities under control even more.”</p><p>Kentaro hadn’t even realized it, but he was indeed not afraid of the river, while others could indeed maybe drown in it.</p><p>“Let’s call it a day?” Ryosuke asked and Kentaro gratefully nodded. He was getting better with his training, but he still couldn’t figure out more about the technique he had used before. When he was standing right inside the water then he had learned how to create a water armor, but other than that he could still not use any water if not directly next to it.</p><p>In his thoughts he kept walking a bit behind Ryosuke and Massu until they made it back to the village border where he looked down to the training ground. Aran was training with a bo staff on his own and while he wasn’t a Phenomenist he was definitely a skilled fighter and especially speed wise he was most likely the fastest out of their Infirm fighters.</p><p>“Are you coming?” Massu asked as Kentaro had stopped.</p><p>“Would you mind going ahead without me?” Kentaro asked and Massu read the atmosphere as he nodded and left with Ryosuke first while Kentaro walked up to the training ground.</p><p>Aran successfully ignored Kentaro’s presence for several minutes, his focus being incredibly precise, but at some point even he had to take a break. Training alone or with opponents didn’t matter as he gave every move he made the energy he would in a real fight as well and with heavy breathes he pushed the end of the staff into the ground, holding on to it for a bit of support.</p><p>“Had fun watching?”</p><p>Aran always seemed annoyed no matter what others did around him, but Kentaro had learned to read his mood by now and he wouldn’t easily get offended by him so he nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Everything you do looks so natural. I feel like I am lacking that physical ability.”</p><p>“That’s because people like you are relying on your abilities too much,” Aran shot back.</p><p>“And even with them I suck,” Kentaro said with a small sigh.</p><p>“You suck because you doubt yourself,” Aran said as he pulled his staff back up and walked up to the other one. “If I doubted myself just one second out there in a real fight, I’d be dead on the spot. No matter who I am up against. You are not invincible either and your mind knows that, but you have to teach it to feel invincible so that you can use the full potential of your abilities.”</p><p>Kentaro was surprised by the advice Aran gave him as he hadn’t thought the boy would care in the first place.</p><p>“I will definitely try that, thanks,” Kentaro said and didn’t want to disturb the other one for longer, but then Aran let out a whistle and when Kentaro turned back he flinched a bit as he caught another staff at the last second.</p><p>“Talking about doing something later is good for nothing. If you want to train then do it now. No time to feel exhausted.”</p><p>Weirdly Kentaro had immediately forgotten the exhaustion from the hour-long training with Massu as he gratefully accepted Aran’s offer to train him in a different kind of fighting style and he definitely needed this one as much as the one with his abilities.</p><p>“Don’t run crying to your brother if I hurt you,” Aran warned and pointed the end of his staff at the smaller one.</p><p>“As long as you don’t run to Myuto if I kick your ass by accident,” Kentaro challenged and for a brief moment Aran finally showed a small smile.</p><p>Maybe at some point Aran would open up to all of them a bit more, but for now getting his ass kicked by him was more attention than Kentaro could have asked for in the first place.</p><p>***</p><p>"So just the two of them?" Taiga asked after Hiromitsu had decided the patrols for the next day and his older brother only nodded, not understanding the younger one's pouting expression.</p><p>"They're getting along well, right?"</p><p>"I wouldn't really say well, not yet," Taiga said as he looked at Nikaido and Taisuke who hadn't looked that excited about having to go on patrol together once more. "But that's not the point."</p><p>"Then what is it? You always complain that I don't let you patrol enough, but now that I put you on patrol, you're not happy either."</p><p>"Four people," Taiga only said and Hiromitsu immediately got the hint and rolled his eyes.</p><p>"It's the south route, of course your group is bigger."</p><p>"Right, because Massu and Ryosuke don’t do the south all by themselves usually."</p><p>"They are both Phenomenists," Hiromitsu argued.</p><p>"Then take one off the team, because my team has now three Phenomenists."</p><p>"Kentaro is still in training," Hiromitsu explained after he had put the two boys together with Ryosuke and Fuma.</p><p>"And still you trust him more than me," Taiga pouted, but Hiromitsu gave him a soft smile.</p><p>"He trusts you that's why I wanted him to be on your team and he easily freaks out while you stay calm, so I thought you could leave the work to Ryosuke and Fuma and just talk a bit?"</p><p>Taiga wanted to keep arguing as he knew that his brother was just good at making it sound like he put so many people on his team to actually help the others, but eventually he just nodded.</p><p>***</p><p>"Why are you in such a hurry?" Nikaido asked while Taisuke kept walking up their route on the western side as if his life depended on making it back to the village in an hour.</p><p>"No particular reason," Taisuke replied and made it to the top of the rocky riverside next to one of their biggest rivers around their territory. After some dry days in the northern region the water wasn’t as fast flowing as usual, but the river was still extremely wide around this area.</p><p>"You don't behave like it's for no particular reason," Nikaido said as he stopped next to him, but of course Taisuke wanted to immediately turn back. This time though, Nikaido grabbed his wrist and stopped him. "Don't tell me you're still pissed going on patrol with me? I thought we were past that."</p><p>Nikaido wasn't exactly angry he was pouting though and to his surprise Taisuke let out a chuckle on his behavior. "No, it's not your fault."</p><p>"Then tell me why you're hurrying so much or are you still not trusting me enough? We're here for weeks already and I feel like we didn't give anyone a single reason to doubt us."</p><p>Taisuke's expression turned a bit gloomy on his words and Nikaido slowly understood why Taisuke was so restless today.</p><p>"It's because Taiga is patrolling the south," Nikaido concluded and Taisuke's look showed him that he was right.</p><p>"I got betrayed by someone I called a close friend, as close as Wataru almost. I just feel scared that I can't be at the right place at the right timing if something ever was to happen again."</p><p>Nikaido was surprised about the other one's honest words as Taisuke obviously didn't like sharing his personal thoughts. With a supportive clap Nikaido put his hand on the other one's shoulder and gave him a smile.</p><p>"They have Fuma and Ryosuke with them. And if anyone ever dared to betray you then at least one of them would kick their asses."</p><p>"I don't doubt you and your brother," Taisuke said as he had of course realized that Nikaido hadn't said the name of his own brother on purpose. "At least I don't want to. I feel that for once I want to put my trust into people again, but it's difficult."</p><p>Another quite emotional statement, but Nikaido was more than happy about the other one finally opening up.</p><p>"You can totally kick my ass if I ever betray you," Nikaido said seriously before his look turned softer and he pushed Taisuke to the back. "Let's head back then?"</p><p>Taisuke nodded and wanted to start walking, but then he turned back to the river. Nikaido didn't even have time to ask what was going on before Taisuke pulled him down towards one of the bigger rocks, but the move came so sudden that Nikaido stumbled to the front and dragged Taisuke down with him, Taisuke hitting the back of his head on the rock behind him with a hiss.</p><p>"Sorry," Nikaido said as he had only been able to break his own fall at the last second, his hand now next to Taisuke's head on the rock. Taisuke obviously wanted to scold him, but when he looked up, he didn't say anything as he hadn't realized how close Nikaido had ended up in front of him and he was more or less trapped between the other one's legs so he put his arms out to push him to the back.</p><p>"Stay down," Taisuke warned as Nikaido wanted to get back up as he got pushed away. But Taisuke pulled him down next to him, but rubbed his head next.</p><p>"Let me have a look," Nikaido said and the other one didn't complain when he touched the back of his head. Taisuke flinched a bit on the touch and Nikaido let out a sigh.</p><p>"It's bleeding, but it's not too bad I think. If we hurry back then Miyata can have a look."</p><p>"I don't think we should head back," Taisuke said and pointed to the other side of the river. Now Nikaido finally spotted them as well. Soldiers from the city. Two trucks.</p><p>"Why are they so far out here?" Nikaido asked.</p><p>"There could be many reasons. We've always waited for them to come. After all, we don't know if our location was revealed to the city. Maybe they're also just finally trying to hunt all of us down?"</p><p>Nikaido nodded as that could definitely be possible. Their village got betrayed before, but no soldiers had shown up after that for years, but that didn't mean that the one who had betrayed them couldn't easily still lead an attack against them if he was involved with the city.</p><p>"Do you think there are more?" Nikaido asked.</p><p>"Most likely not, I feel like they're looking for someone maybe?"</p><p>The way the soldiers hurried ahead on the other side of the river could actually mean that they were chasing after someone.</p><p>"Another Phenomenist?"</p><p>"Maybe? Or someone like Aran," Taisuke concluded.</p><p>"Shall we keep an eye on them or go to Taiga's location?" Nikaido asked, knowing of course that the other one was worried.</p><p>"Let's go after them," Taisuke said and while it was obvious that he wanted to head to his little brother's location he also knew that the village was in danger if the soldiers made it inside their territory. So stopping them was their first priority for now.</p><p>***</p><p>"Stop pouting," Ryosuke said and hit Taiga against the ribs with his elbow, making the other one retreat towards the other side of Kentaro.</p><p>"Look he's running away from you so that he can pout next to the only person who won't scold him," Fuma laughed, dragging Ryosuke's attention to the front and the two boys made their way ahead.</p><p>"I bet your brother is pouting right now as well," Kentaro said with a teasing smile and it made Taiga smile a bit too.</p><p>"Each time Mitsu let me do anything in the first place, Taisuke would freak out. I feel sorry for Nikaido already."</p><p>"He'll be alright. They can handle each other," Kentaro laughed as he kept walking so they wouldn't lose Fuma and Ryosuke who had started quarreling as the forest ground in front of them turned muddy close to the waterfall and Fuma wanted to push Ryosuke into one of the mud puddles.</p><p>"Let's take a look at the border and head back?" Kentaro said and pointed at the waterfall in front of them, next to the cliff that would stop everyone from trying to sneak their way into their territory.</p><p>"You don't want to show off?" Ryosuke asked when they stopped at the waterfall and Kentaro waited for them to turn around.</p><p>"What?" Kentaro asked startled.</p><p>"You're the only one who can go through," Fuma said and pointed at the heavy water falling all the way down to the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>"Do we need to go to the other side?"</p><p>"Scared that your own ability will fail you?" Ryosuke teased, but by now Kentaro was sure that the water would never do him any harm. But the challenging looks the other two gave him, made him step right under the waterfall, the water not touching his skin at all.</p><p>"Impressive," Fuma laughed, but then Kentaro stretched out his arm and grabbed Fuma's wrist.</p><p>"Then you should try it too."</p><p>Fuma started squealing when Kentaro tried to drag him under the waterfall and he broke free before he could end up under it.</p><p>"Fire users are hydrophobic," Ryosuke laughed.</p><p>"Then what about you?" Kentaro asked challenging, but Ryosuke shook his head.</p><p>"No way I'll try that."</p><p>"I'll do it," Taiga said and stepped towards Kentaro without hesitation and his friend gave him a proud look before he took the other one's hand.</p><p>"Not even a Phenomenist and yet braver than you," Kentaro teased the others before he pulled Taiga under the waterfall. The waterfall itself was several meters wide and moved around the mountain so they wouldn't be able to see the others from the other side anymore, but Kentaro wasn't in a hurry. He enjoyed the way Taiga looked up in fascination as the water missed both of them by inches even if he lifted his hand and tried to touch it.</p><p>"I guess we shouldn't tell your brothers that we tried this?" Kentaro asked and Taiga nodded with a chuckle.</p><p>"They'll definitely not let you go on patrol with me again if we tell them."</p><p>"Then let's make the best out of it," Kentaro said and dared something he wasn't even sure would work, but somehow his trust into the water had become a lot more and while he needed to keep his hand around Taiga’s, he made a step away from the wall and Taiga immediately grabbed his arm with his free hand. "What are you up to? You'll fall," Taiga said when Kentaro was one step away from where the water would fall down the cliff.</p><p>"Are you sure of that?" Kentaro asked and dared to step off the path. As if it was only a game with no consequences he felt confident enough to dare this move and while Taiga had clawed his hands into the other one's arm, ready to actually try and hold his bodyweight if he fell, the other one wasn't falling.</p><p>"What…but how?" Taiga asked when he realized that the water underneath Kentaro had formed something like a puddle, but it was hanging in the air.</p><p>"Don't ask me about details I have no clue. I just felt like I could do it. Want to try?" Kentaro asked and finally Taiga relaxed his hands, feeling sorry for digging his fingernails into the other one's skin, but he had been prepared to fall over with him as he was sure that he wouldn't have been able to rescue them both. But this time he hesitated a moment, but then he took a deep breath and dared his foot out and to his astonishment the puddle widened, allowing him to step on it.</p><p>But when he dared both of his feet off the path, he took a tight grip on Kentaro, still not trusting the situation.</p><p>"Water users are amazing," Taiga said with a wide smile. It was nice seeing Taiga more relaxed and daring what his brothers would never allow him. But Kentaro still dragged them both back to the path before anything could actually happen.</p><p>"Guys come on, we need to leave," Ryosuke was heard from the other side. Only a faint voice as the water was too loud to hear him clearly.</p><p>"Okay, then let's just have a peak on the other side and leave," Kentaro said and guided the way while keeping Taiga's wrist in a tight grip.</p><p>What none of them had seen coming was someone dashing towards their direction and he didn't stop at the waterfall. A move that could not be called anything else than suicidal. Kentaro didn’t have enough time to react and the person crashed right into him, making them both fall and that was when he accidentally let go of Taiga's arm.</p><p>Taiga didn't even have enough time to let out a scream when the water dragged him over the side of the path, but with him the other person also got dragged along.</p><p>"TAIGA!" Kentaro shouted in panic as he had turned on his stomach and stretched his arm out towards the cliff. He knew that he wouldn't be fast enough to jump after them, but while he had feared to not even be able to spot them anymore, something incredible had happened.</p><p>Both boys were lying on another water puddle, the water now moving beside them. Kentaro couldn't believe his eyes, but he knew he had to focus.</p><p>Taiga looked more than shaken, so did the other boy. A boy their age, a panicked expression on his face as he looked at Taiga.</p><p>"Don't move. I'll get you up," Kentaro said and took another deep breath, knowing that he needed to put all his energy into his abilities now to lift them up on the water. Luckily he succeeded and he grabbed both boys by the arms and the puddle fell like the rest of the water.</p><p>"I seriously thought I'd be dead," Taiga let out with heavy breaths, but then looked up at the boy. "Let's get him out."</p><p>Kentaro immediately nodded as he was close to collapsing after using so much of his energy. But the boy shook his head with a panicked look when they wanted to push him towards the way he came from.</p><p>"Please, they will kill me!"</p><p>Now they halted as they exchanged a knowing look.</p><p>"Are soldiers after you?" Taiga asked and the boy nodded in a hurry. He looked beaten and exhausted, obviously running for days already, but there was no time for long talks as Kentaro put his last energy into keeping a tight grip on their arms and Taiga had to decide quickly so he pulled both towards the side of the village.</p><p>"Let's talk on the other side. Kentaro, just hold on for a few moments longer," Taiga said as he helped Kentaro stand and the other boy read the atmosphere and helped Kentaro as well.</p><p>The moment they dashed out the waterfall on the other side things escalated in seconds as Ryosuke misunderstood the situation and almost threw the other boy with his telekinesis back into the waterfall, but Kentaro used the water to push the boy back.</p><p>"Stop, he's not going to do you any harm. He's getting followed by soldiers," Taiga interfered and jumped in front of the boy.</p><p>"Right, what an amazing timing to stand on the other side of the waterfall without any soldiers actually being behind him," Ryosuke said skeptically while Kentaro dropped to the ground and gave up on interfering as he was now completely out of energy.</p><p>"I'm sorry for the trouble. I thought I shook them off last night, but I could suddenly hear their trucks right behind me and panicked," the boy explained.</p><p>"So you thought committing suicide was the best way out?" Fuma asked, also quite skeptical.</p><p>"I hoped I could somehow make it through without getting dragged over the edge," the boy said in a low voice, the exhaustion on his face more than clear.</p><p>"Anyway, we need to report that soldiers are around and my brother can decide the rest," Taiga decided and turned towards the boy who was also sitting on the ground now. When Taiga stretched his arm out to him, the boy hesitated.</p><p>"We're not here to hurt you, don't worry," Taiga said and the boy finally took his hand, letting himself get dragged up.</p><p>"The only one who got hurt here is Kentaro and I won't take Nikaido's scolding for it," Fuma said as he walked up to the boy who was lying flat on the ground.</p><p>"Be happy that Taiga didn't get hurt or we'd be dead," Ryosuke said and joined Fuma so that they could help Kentaro up.</p><p>"Then let's go, the sooner we report back the better," Fuma said and started moving while Taiga looked at the new boy.</p><p>"What's your name?" Taiga asked as he wanted to keep the complicated questions for later.</p><p>The boy didn't seem reluctant to answer and he didn't seem like someone who would easily get scared, yet whatever had him flee from the city had him obviously fear for his life.</p><p>"Juri," the boy finally replied with a slight bow.</p><p>"Nice to meet you, Juri. Well I guess you know our names by now already with all the scolding," Taiga laughed, but Juri was still too tense to easily join the teasing mood.</p><p>"I promise you that there is nothing bad awaiting you ahead," Taiga said a bit more serious, but Juri seemed to not be able to easily trust people and Taiga definitely had to make sure that Taisuke wouldn’t do the same to him as he did with Kentaro and Nikaido or Juri would definitely not stay and somehow Taiga didn't want the other one to immediately leave again.</p>

<p>"They're trying to get over," Nikaido realized as they had followed the soldiers almost up to the northern border where the river wasn't as deep anymore and they wanted to try their luck getting over it with their trucks.</p><p>"Now we could use Kentaro's abilities," Taisuke said as he tried to figure out what to do.</p><p>"Shall we hurry back and get everyone for backup?" Nikaido asked.</p><p>"If there are even more of them then they might be busy already so let's do something on our own," Taisuke said, but didn't dare to step away from the rocks they had followed down the cliff side of the river until now.</p><p>"They will know that we're here if we attack straight on so they could send more trucks," Nikaido concluded and that was also the other one's worry.</p><p>"But if we let them go on then they will reach the village," Taisuke said a bit panicked as the first truck approached the small slope between the cliffs they were standing on.</p><p>"I've got an idea," Nikaido said and dashed ahead. Taisuke followed him to the back of the cliffs. "Let's make it crumble. If we stay hidden and make your fire spread on the backside then they will think it was just a natural disaster."</p><p>"I can only make one side crumble, we won't have enough time for both sides," Taisuke said.</p><p>"Right, you need to stay here, but I can go," Nikaido said and held out his hand.</p><p>"Who says you'll even make it over there with my abilities?"</p><p>"Then you go and I stay here, but hurry up," Nikaido said, but Taisuke hesitated. They didn't even know if this would work that easily.</p><p>"You prefer them entering the village area?" Nikaido asked and with a click of his tongue Taisuke put his hand in Nikaido's, but nothing happened. Even when he tried to use his transfer abilities it didn't show the desired result.</p><p>"Focus, Gaya!"</p><p>"Don't call me that," the other one said, but it had done the trick as the moment he had squeezed Nikaido's hand in a scolding manner, the same feeling as before went through his body and Nikaido closed his eyes with a small gasp as he tried to calm down.</p><p>"Breath slowly and keep an eye on me," Taisuke told him when he dared to get up. He had to hurry if they wanted this to work. "I'll give you a sign from the other side when to release the fire."</p><p>Nikaido only nodded, clenching his fists and trying hard to keep the untamed fire inside of him for as long as possible.</p><p>Taisuke hurried to make it to the other side of the cliffs, unseen by the soldiers, but he needed to retreat from the slope for that and it took him way more time than they had.</p><p>Finally on top of the cliffs on the opposite side of the slope, the second truck had also made it on their side of the river and they were approaching the slope.</p><p>There was no time to waste and Taisuke searched for Nikaido, the other one waiting more than impatiently for his signal as he had already folded to the front.</p><p>Taisuke raised one arm and pulled it back down, Nikaido immediately putting his hands down to the ground and the strength he was able to put into Taisuke's fire was fascinating. Taisuke immediately did the same, but while he didn't feel like he had transferred too much to Nikaido, his own remaining fire couldn't at all bring the same destruction as Nikaido on his side. Luckily though it was enough for both of the cliffs to start crumbling. Unfortunately through the dust rising from the falling rocks, Taisuke couldn't spot the other one anymore when he jumped back, escaping the falling rocks.</p><p>Now that the rocks had formed a wall between them and the soldiers, he dared to directly dash towards Nikaido's direction.</p><p>"Nikaido, where are you?" He shouted, knowing that the soldiers wouldn't hear him. But he couldn't spot the other one around the collapsed area. "Damn it, this was your plan."</p><p>With some curses he tried to move some rocks and climb up more, but still no sign.</p><p>"I swear I'll kill you," Taisuke hissed as he kept looking. "Nika, come on, this can't always happen when I give you my abilities."</p><p>"And it won't."</p><p>The voice came from behind and Taisuke turned around with a death glare as he spotted the other one grinning up at him from a safe distance away from the rocks.</p><p>"I got used to using your abilities more than I thought," Nikaido said proudly as he was completely unharmed and only a bit exhausted.</p><p>Taisuke stormed back down to him, so fast actually that he almost ran into the other one and pointed at his face. "I'll go back to hating you if you keep that attitude."</p><p>"So you can have an attitude and I can't?" Nikaido teased, not feeling threatened at all. "By the way you said it again."</p><p>"Said what?" Taisuke yelled back as he threw his arms up, still angry at the other one.</p><p>"Nika," Nikaido said with a bright smile and Taisuke immediately rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Whatever, let’s hurry back. We need to find out why they were around here,” Taisuke said. If they were aiming for their village then this was going to be just the beginning.</p><p>***</p><p>“Daddy, you need to ring the bells,” Hana yelled towards Miyata as she and her brother ran up to him and his mother from behind their hut.</p><p>“Why is that honey?” Her mother asked and the little girl pointed towards the forest.</p><p>“They brought someone new.”</p><p>The adults exchanged a worried look and hurried around the hut, seeing Fuma and Ryosuke stabilizing Kentaro, while Taiga walked in the back with an unknown boy.</p><p>“Ken, don’t!” Miyata warned his son as he was about to run up to one of the bells. But the situation didn’t seem dangerous and Miyata didn’t want anyone to attack them without knowing the situation.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Aran asked as he walked up to Miyata after he had heard the children shout. But then he looked ahead and tensed on the arrival of someone new.</p><p>“Aran, get Hiromitsu and Wataru here,” Miyata ordered and Aran immediately did as he was told.</p><p>Massu was out on patrol and most of the others were in the fields or in the meeting hall so he hurried to find them, not that it looked like a dangerous situation.</p><p>“At least they didn’t seem to see you as a direct threat,” Taiga said as he realized that no one was ringing the bells even though some people had already spotted them.</p><p>“I am grateful for your help, I won’t cause any trouble,” Juri said, but Fuma laughed.</p><p>“You might not, but they will.”</p><p>On that statement Taiga looked ahead to the other side of the forest border and with the worst timing ever Nikaido and Taisuke had also just arrived back at the village and had of course immediately spotted them.</p><p>“Stop here,” Kentaro said and made Ryosuke and Fuma let go of him as they had reached the small stream around the village that Kentaro had used on their arrival as well. “Could you do me the favor and run ahead and explain the situation?”</p><p>Ryosuke and Fuma nodded, but they had to be fast, because Taisuke had already spotted the new boy and of course he was on his way over to them, while Nikaido obviously worried as well, but tried to make him slow down.</p><p>“Stay behind me,” Kentaro said as he realized that Hiromitsu was rushing towards them from the huts as well, followed by Wataru. Aran and Myuto were following them, but they took their distance.</p><p>“He’s not dangerous. He got followed by soldiers, we rescued him,” Ryosuke shouted over to Taisuke before he had even been close, but he knew already that those words won’t easily stop him.</p><p>“Are we now just letting everyone come here and tell their oh so heartwarming story?” Taisuke hissed at him and Fuma jumped out of the way when Taisuke didn’t even think about stopping in front of them.</p><p>“Gaya, look at him. Does he look dangerous?” Nikaido tried to argue and finally reached out for the other one’s wrist after Ryosuke and Fuma didn’t want to risk interfering more.</p><p>Taisuke tried to shake him off, but to his surprise Nikaido used more force than he expected and pulled him back so that he almost stumbled.</p><p>“For god’s sake, I’m not telling you to greet him with a hug, but don’t you think that if he wanted to directly harm someone that he would have already done so?” Nikaido scolded the other one. “Taiga is beside him, but so is Kentaro and look at them, they are ready to stop you from attacking him, so just give them some space?”</p><p>In the moment they had stopped, Hiromitsu had made it over to the boys and Taiga gave Juri a soothing smile when Hiromitsu told him and Kentaro to get over to Wataru and of course they obeyed.</p><p>“Fine, let’s hear what he has to say then,” Taisuke said and took a deep breath. Something Nikaido hadn’t seen coming as he thought Taisuke would pick a fight with him now, but he had indeed succeeded to relax enough for Nikaido to believe in him for once and they made it over to Mitsu with calmer steps.</p><p>“So what is going on?” Taisuke asked and looked first at Taiga then at Juri. His little brother gave him a proud look though as he realized how hard it was for him to stay this calm.</p><p>“We checked up on the waterfall and when we were at the other side he ran into us. He said he was followed by soldiers,” Kentaro said and Nikaido walked up to him, putting his arm around his shoulder as he realized how exhausted he was and the boy gave him a grateful smile.</p><p>“Is that true?” Hiromitsu asked Juri who seemed a bit uncomfortable standing all by himself with the village members all around him.</p><p>“Yes,” he let out with a nod.</p><p>“Are you a Phenomenist?” Wataru asked, but the boy shook his head. “Then why did you flee from the city?”</p><p>By now Ryosuke and Fuma had walked back up to them, while Aran and Myuto had also finally dared to join them.</p><p>“I’ve seen something I wasn’t supposed to see and I was afraid that they would kill me if they found out so I ran.”</p><p>“That would explain why the soldiers even went all the way up north to look for him,” Nikaido said as he explained that they had run into soldiers at the river.</p><p>“Is that why you are hurt?” Taiga asked as he realized that Taisuke had some dried blood on the back of his head and his brother put his hand up to the now dry wound and looked over to Nikaido who wasn’t looking back at him so he only nodded with a weird feeling in his chest. “Yeah kind of. Nothing bad though.”</p><p>Taiga gave him a skeptical look, but moved his attention back to Juri.</p><p>“Mind telling us about what you’ve seen?” Hiromitsu asked, but the boy seemed unsure. The panic from before was back in his eyes and Taiga walked up to Hiromitsu.</p><p>“Can we give him some time to calm down? He almost fell down the cliffs at the waterfall. He definitely ran through the forest for days, fearing for his life. Give him some time?”</p><p>Taiga’s request was answered with a nod from his oldest brother, but then Taisuke walked up to his other side and touched his clothes.</p><p>“Seems like he wasn’t the only one taking his chances at the waterfall?” Taisuke asked and looked back at Kentaro.</p><p>“Don’t even start any scolding now. Everything was fine, we couldn’t have predicted Juri showing up out of nowhere.”</p><p>“Everyone is safe, so let’s leave it at that for now, okay?” Wataru suggested and everyone agreed.</p><p>“I'll stay with you until Massu is back from his patrol,” Hiromitsu said and Juri nodded.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?” Taisuke asked Taiga as the boy walked up to Juri.</p><p>“How would you feel if someone threw you alone into a hut in a village where you know absolutely no one with a guard in front of your house?” Taiga replied and before Taisuke could turn things into an argument Aran actually stepped up.</p><p>“I can join you guys, then Taiga won’t be alone at least?”</p><p>“Count me in too then you have at least a Phenomenist around too,” Myuto offered and Hiromitsu agreed, but then looked at Juri.</p><p>“Is that okay for you? If you want to be left alone then that is also okay with us.”</p><p>“I’m okay with them staying,” Juri immediately said, stepping a bit more towards Taiga.</p><p>“Then let’s do it that way and you two need to explain where you’ve seen the soldiers so that we can send out more people in the afternoon once more towards the waterfall and the river,” Wataru said and with that Taisuke had no choice, but to join Wataru in the meeting hall and leave Taiga with the others, but Nikaido clapped him on the shoulder with a supportive look.</p><p>“He’ll be fine, don’t worry.”</p><p>“I will join them later too, but I really want to lie down,” Kentaro said.</p><p>When Fuma and Ryosuke wanted to help Kentaro to get to his hut so that Nikaido could follow the others to the meeting hall, Taisuke stepped in front of him.</p><p>“Did you let Taiga go under the waterfall?” Taisuke asked directly and now that things had indeed turned out quite dangerous, Kentaro felt bad about letting the boy join. But it was obvious so he could only nod.</p><p>Nikaido got ready to interfere and scold Taisuke in case he would lay a hand on his little brother, but to everyone’s surprise it came different as Taisuke sighed and stepped back.</p><p>“At least you took responsibility and got him out of there.”</p><p>Kentaro blinked in confusion when Taisuke just turned around and left like that, Nikaido showing a smile before he hurried after Taisuke.</p><p>“Was that a passive thank you for rescuing Taiga?” Fuma asked.</p><p>“After a scolding for putting Taiga into danger,” Ryosuke added with a chuckle.</p><p>“I can’t read the atmosphere anymore when he is around,” Kentaro said and massaged his temples.</p><p>“Your brother seems to be a good influence,” Ryosuke said with a smile. “For now leave the patrolling stuff to us, because you need to rest, let’s go.”</p><p>***</p><p>“We can leave at any time, just let us know if you want to rest,” Taiga said when they entered one of the huts while Hiromitsu remained outside.</p><p>Aran and Myuto moved over to the table and sat down, keeping a bit of distance so that they wouldn’t overwhelm Juri right from the start.</p><p>“Here, I think they should fit,” Taiga said as he handed Juri some of his own clothes he had taken from his hut in a hurry on their way as well as a change of clothes for himself.</p><p>“Right, you’re still completely soaked,” Aran realized and walked up to the stove, Myuto helping him to start a fire to help them dry their clothes.</p><p>Taiga just got out of his jacket and shirt without any hesitation, but when he caught Juri looking, but not moving himself he gave him a small smile. “We can also leave the hut for a moment if you want more privacy to change?” Taiga asked, but Juri immediately shook his head, but still turned away a bit to change his clothes.</p><p>Juri joined Taiga on the carpet in front of the stove to hang up his clothes and when he sat back, he looked towards the door.</p><p>“No one will hurt you here, don’t worry,” Taiga reminded him.</p><p>“I guess you’ve never encountered Phenomenists so far?” Myuto asked, but to their surprise Juri shook his head. First it seemed like Juri wanted to say something, but then he clenched his fists into the fabric of his trousers and bit his lip.</p><p>“Well, let’s start with some introductions?” Taiga asked and Juri seemed relieved about the way Taiga was able to read the atmosphere. “I’m the youngest brother of three. Mitsu is the leader of our village, he is my oldest brother. Then we have Taisuke…”</p><p>“The noisy one, you just met him,” Myuto said with a teasing smile.</p><p>“That one,” Taiga laughed. “He is the troublemaker in our family. The middle brother. Both of them are Phenomenists, I am an Infirm.”</p><p>“For now,” Myuto reminded him.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Juri asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“Phenomenists can still get their abilities when they are young adults, so Taiga could also still become one,” Aran explained.</p><p>“So could you,” Myuto teased, but Aran rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Better not.”</p><p>“Do you not like Phenomenists?” Juri asked in surprise as Aran was obviously a member of this village.</p><p>“I don’t like some Phenomenists, but they are not here so it’s fine. But that doesn’t mean I want to become one.”</p><p>Something about what Aran had said made Juri look at him for a moment, but when they all just kept the conversation going, he looked back down for a moment, but Taiga had of course seen his reaction.</p><p>“Good that everyone here is nice, well maybe a few need some time to warm up to outsiders, but as long as you don’t attack Taiga, Taisuke won’t try to kill you,” Myuto laughed and Taiga kicked his chair, but then shrugged his shoulders, because it was more or less true.</p><p>“I am not sure if I should stay,” Juri finally let out and somehow that brought a sad expression on Taiga’s face.</p><p>“Kentaro, the boy who helped you out at the waterfall just came a few weeks ago with his older brother to this village and they fit in really well, I bet you would too.”</p><p>Juri seemed grateful for Taiga’s words, but he also didn’t seem convinced that he should stay.</p><p>“Where else would you go?” Aran asked. “To the north are just more Phenomenists scattered over the country, no other Infirm cities lie ahead.”</p><p>“I just fear that I will cause trouble for you if I stay. The soldiers tracked my location so far northwards already, I feel like they won’t easily give up.”</p><p>The boys exchanged a worried look on hearing that as they definitely needed to know more about why they were after Juri, but for now they wanted to give the boy a break.</p><p>A knock on the door made them turn as Massu opened the door.</p><p>“Sorry for the interruption. I just heard what happened, you all good in here?”</p><p>On his question all the boys nodded and Juri gave the other one a light bow before his look fell on Hiromitsu who remained outside, but gave him a brief smile as well.</p><p>“Mitsu wants to have a talk tomorrow at the meeting hall,” Massu explained. “For now some of us will patrol around the closer borders of the village, but at least one of us will be around. Until tomorrow I have to ask you to stay inside, okay?”</p><p>Juri immediately nodded and then Massu turned towards the boys. “I need to ask you to patrol in shifts with everyone, but we will send someone else in later so until then you can stay.”</p><p>They all nodded as Taiga was aware that none of them would be allowed to stay alone with Juri for now, but they were at least not that over skeptical as with Nikaido and Kentaro.</p><p>***</p><p>“So for now they don’t seem to have found any way towards the village,” Nikaido said in relief as they had come back from their second patrol in the evening as it was already dark outside.</p><p>“If the boy has done something that will make them keep chasing him then it will just be a matter of time though,” Taisuke said.</p><p>“We will hopefully get to know more about that by tomorrow.”</p><p>When they kept walking Wataru came towards their direction, taking over the patrol with some other fighters as they were extra careful and would patrol at least close to the village even overnight.</p><p>“Anything?” Wataru asked, but Taisuke shook his head.</p><p>“Here?”</p><p>“Oh yeah so much. Juri became a fearful Phenomenist out of nowhere and took Taiga hostage, fleeing into the forest,” Wataru teased, gaining a laugh from Nikaido and a death glare from Taisuke.</p><p>“But seriously Taisuke, just relax for the rest of the night, okay?” Wataru said and clapped his friend on the shoulder. “Massu is guarding the place and Kentaro, Fuma and Taiga are with Juri. They will be fine.”</p><p>“Not good at taking long rests,” Nikaido scolded his little brother, but he understood that he wanted to be with Taiga in this situation.</p><p>“Be careful,” Taisuke said as Wataru walked towards the border and waved at them once more.</p><p>In silence they walked back towards the village, but then Nikaido slowed down close to Taisuke’s hut. “Why do you have your own hut and Taiga is staying with Mitsu?”</p><p>“Because we have enough huts? Taiga could live by himself if he wanted to.”</p><p>Somehow that didn’t seem like the reply Nikaido had expected and he let out a thoughtful hum.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing, I just thought it’s a bit weird that your hut is so much at the outside of the village while you usually try to protect Taiga all the time.”</p><p>“I am protecting him with this,” Taisuke said, his voice lower this time.</p><p>“And how is that?” Nikaido asked and when the other one turned away with a kind of pouting expression through all the questions, Nikaido started teasing him and kept hitting him on the shoulder so that he would reply.</p><p>“Would you stop that? Damn, you can be so annoying!” Taisuke said and tried to stop the other one from poking him the entire time, but the way he did it was more than cute as he kept waving around him like a child, trying to hit Nikaido’s hands on the way, making the other one laugh.</p><p>“Then tell me,” Nikaido teased, but then Taisuke’s look turned a bit darker as he looked towards the back of the village where one of the huge rocks close to the training ground still reminded him of how destructive his abilities could be.</p><p>“I feel like I could eventually hurt someone if I can’t control my abilities,” Taisuke finally admitted and that was more of the reply Nikaido had expected.</p><p>“Not making fun of me?” Taisuke asked and Nikaido smiled back at him.</p><p>“Oh, if you want me to, then I can totally do that, but to be honest after I’ve experienced how much out of control your abilities can be I can totally understand your reasons.”</p><p>Taisuke hadn’t expected the other one to understand his reasons so well, but he also still didn’t like it to speak this honestly so he turned away and started walking towards his hut. “Then you know why I chose this hut. You can be happy that yours is also not close by.”</p><p>Right at his door Taisuke realized that Nikaido had kept walking after him and now he looked over his shoulder in slight confusion when Nikaido gave him a piercing look.</p><p>“What now?”</p><p>“Let me stay.”</p><p>“WHAT?” Taisuke had yelled the question louder than he wanted to, but luckily no one was around who could easily hear them and Nikaido tried hard to hide his laughter.</p><p>“I just asked you to let me stay, nothing more. Is your hut such a mess or why won’t you let anyone stay?”</p><p>“I didn’t say I wouldn't let anyone stay,” Taisuke hissed back at the other one in a quieter voice this time.</p><p>“Great,” Nikaido replied and walked up to the door, Taisuke immediately blocking the entrance.</p><p>“That was no invitation. You have your own hut and Kentaro is not even there right now, so you won’t wake him up.”</p><p>“Yet I have to make sure that you wake up on time tomorrow morning for the meeting. You have a habit of being late, remember? And now Taiga is busy so he won’t be able to throw you out of bed,” Nikaido teased.</p><p>“You can still come by tomorrow morning if I oversleep,” Taisuke replied, while he became smaller and smaller, trapped between Nikaido and the door.</p><p>“Then take it as a challenge,” Nikaido replied. “You are afraid of hurting others with your abilities, yet I can absorb them and I showed you that I got better in handling them too, so I am the perfect person to try and corner you a bit when you feel like your abilities could cause trouble.”</p><p>“I don’t need anyone to corner me for that,” Taisuke bit back, but then Nikaido put one hand to the doorframe, making Taisuke press his back even more into the door.</p><p>“Then why are you trying so hard to run away?”</p><p>Taisuke had prepared a good reply, but then he suddenly fell back as he had accidentally put too much pressure on the door and had opened it while leaning back. With a squeal he fell inside his own hut, making Nikaido burst out laughing.</p><p>“Well, now I am taking this as an invitation,” Nikaido said and casually stepped over Taisuke, entering the hut.</p><p>It was a bit smaller than the one he was using with Kentaro as it was obviously only made for one person in the first place.</p><p>“What the hell?” Taisuke complained, but shut the door instead of trying to make Nikaido leave.</p><p>“Now I am here, get over it. How about you help light a fire, it’s not really warm right now, you know?”</p><p>Taisuke let out a snort, but actually walked up to the stove to help and when the fire was finally lit, he sat down at the small table that had only space for two people instead of four like most of their huts.</p><p>“You don’t want to sleep?” Nikaido asked and Taisuke threw his hands up into the air.</p><p>“I want to, trust me, but you are here, keeping me awake.”</p><p>“I have nothing against going to bed. We patrolled a lot today and we need to wake up early anyway.”</p><p>“Then go home!” Taisuke complained, but Nikaido pointed at Taisuke’s bed.</p><p>“You have a double bed.”</p><p>“AND?” Taisuke asked, now getting up from the chair to walk over to his bed. “I don’t get you. I almost killed you with my dumb power transfer the first time and just because it somehow worked this time, you are unnecessarily putting yourself into danger.”</p><p>There was a brief moment where Nikaido could see the fire forming in Taisuke’s hands, the typical reaction he would show when he was getting emotional.</p><p>Taisuke immediately clenched his fists, cursing himself, but then he froze when Nikaido reached out for his hands and put his own over the other one’s closed fists.</p><p>“I am putting myself into danger, because I want you to trust yourself. Just if you finally learn how to control your own abilities, you will be able to calm down around everyone.”</p><p>“This is ridiculous, why would you-”</p><p>“Let my reasons be my own for now, okay? I am one of the people you get angry at the easiest, so I can help you the most with getting in control too, don’t you think?”</p><p>“And I can kill you the easiest out of everyone because of that,” Taisuke said and pulled his hands back, but this time no fire emerged as he crossed his arms and sat down on his bed.</p><p>“You’re doing great so far,” Nikaido said. “But I won’t push you any further if you really think that you wouldn’t be able to stay calm, but I believe that you could.”</p><p>“I will kick you out of my bed I swear,” Taisuke said, making the other one chuckle.</p><p>“If that is the only thing I have to worry about then that’s a relief.”</p><p>To Nikaido’s surprise Taisuke moved to the back of his bed, maybe a bit too far towards the corner, but it was an obvious invitation and Nikaido sat down on the bed with a proud smile.</p><p>“I still think this is ridiculous,” Taisuke said as he pulled on the covers so that Nikaido would get off them.</p><p>“Well, that is because you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Just think about it as if Wataru was going to stay the night, no problem with that, right?”</p><p>Taisuke would indeed not have a problem with that, except that he wouldn’t allow that either as he had his hut for himself out of exactly those security reasons. He just feared too much that his abilities could suddenly cause uproar for the most ridiculous reasons even though it hadn’t happened to that extent anymore after the night he had been betrayed.</p><p>Yet something about Nikaido’s words had him stare at the other one’s back as Nikaido had moved under the covers, but gave Taisuke the space he needed and turned towards the other side.</p><p>“Let me know if I have to move to the carpet at some point,” Nikaido teased as he looked over his shoulder once more at which Taisuke took one of his pillows to hit Nikaido with it.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Nikaido only laughed at the other one’s pouting reaction and turned back, but somehow Taisuke felt calmer than he thought he would. He was still annoyed, that was for sure, but he was also kind of pouting about the lack of attention he got now after the other one had more or less forced him to let him stay. His own thoughts made him shake his head though and he turned towards the wall. This was definitely an outcome he hadn’t seen coming, yet it brought a smile on his face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean he wasn't home?" Taiga asked when Kentaro had gone to wake up Nikaido, because he feared he'd run late for the meeting after patrolling for so long.</p><p>Taiga went with him as he knew that he had to wake up Taisuke as well for sure.</p><p>"But Mitsu said they weren't at the meeting hall, right?" Taiga asked with a thoughtful expression. "Let's wake up my brother for now so we have at least one going."</p><p>Taiga also wanted to add that he wanted to return to the hall as fast as possible as Juri didn't seem thrilled to be left alone with Hiromitsu and Wataru. The others had to patrol and for once Taiga was grateful that he didn't need to patrol if he didn't want to and right now he definitely didn't want to.</p><p>"Maybe he thought I was home so he didn't want to wake me up? Maybe he used one of the open huts?" Kentaro asked and Taiga only nodded as he approached Taisuke's hut and opened the door without even knocking.</p><p>Kentaro waited outside, but when Taiga had frozen half in the doorframe, he got curious and walked up to him, looking into the room over his shoulder.</p><p>The moment he took a deep breath though, Taiga immediately put his hand over his mouth and shook his head. He pointed towards the door and just stretched his arm out to put a cup on the table on the side so it would start rolling before he carefully closed the door and told Kentaro to start walking before the cup would hit the ground.</p><p>Behind the next hut they stopped, both of them dumbfounded for a moment.</p><p>"You've seen what I've seen, right?" Taiga asked and Kentaro slowly nodded.</p><p>"So, what do we do?" Kentaro asked, but Taiga shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>"Pretend we didn't see it? Because honestly," Taiga started and slowly formed a smile. "I don't really mind?"</p><p>Kentaro seemed more than happy about the other one's reaction as he nodded. For him it was definitely a weird choice, but if his brother was able to actually form a bond after such a rough start then he wouldn't stand in his way.</p><p>"Great, then let's hurry back, they will definitely jump up and run over to the meeting hall immediately," Taiga said and the boys made their way back with some chuckles and head shaking.</p><p>Just a few days ago their brothers still started random fights with each other so this was definitely the calmest outcome for now.</p><p>***</p><p>The cup rolled for a few seconds and then the metal hit the wooden floor.</p><p>Nikaido immediately sat up, confused for a moment from where the sound had come, but then he sighed and lay back down, intuitively turning around and then he froze.</p><p>Taisuke hadn't even woken up through the noise, but overnight he had moved closer and was now lying right in front of the other one.</p><p>Nikaido knew that they would run late, but he wondered when the last time was that Taisuke had actually dared to let someone get this close? Lost in his thoughts he almost missed when Taisuke opened his eyes and he wanted to shift to the back, not realizing that the bed ended sooner than he thought and with a yelp he landed on the ground.</p><p>"What's with the noise so early in the morning?" Taisuke asked in a tired voice when he looked over the bed frame to the ground.</p><p>"First it's not early. We're running late and second this isn't the first noise, but you seem to be a really deep sleeper after all," Nikaido said as he sat up and was now right in front of Taisuke.</p><p>A few seconds passed in silence until Taisuke's eyes grew wide. He had obviously forgotten that Nikaido had been with him in the first place and when he threw the blanket over himself Nikaido chuckled and got up.</p><p>"Let's get ready," Nikaido said neutrally and gave Taisuke the space he needed right now.</p><p>Without delay they got ready and headed to the meeting hall. Of course everyone was already waiting for them and Mitsu scolded them for running late.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Taisuke asked as Taiga was waiting inside the meeting hall while it should have been only Hiromitsu and Wataru together with Juri.</p><p>“Juri asked if he could join,” Wataru said before Taisuke could get angry yet Juri seemed to be the one who feared to have angered the other one.</p><p>“Fine,” Taisuke said and walked to the other side of the meeting table to sit down next to Nikaido.</p><p>“Okay, let’s not make this too much of a scary meeting,” Hiromitsu started. “Juri, we really want to help you, but we need to know more about what happened or your presence in our village might bring trouble to all of us.”</p><p>Juri understood that of course and he slowly nodded, but gave a side glance towards Taiga and when he got a supportive nod, Nikaido leant over to Taisuke.</p><p>“I feel like they have already spoken about this last night,” Nikaido whispered and Taisuke had the same thought. Having Taiga and the other boys stay with Juri had a positive effect on the boy, but that didn’t mean that Taisuke would immediately trust him.</p><p>“There are Phenomenists in the city,” Juri started, an information that wasn’t that new to them. “Those who get discovered inside the city always get taken to the tower research center and until recently no one had ever seen anyone leave it.”</p><p>“Did you ever witness that as well?” Wataru asked Nikaido who needed a moment to realize that the question was for him. Slowly he nodded, feeling as uncomfortable as Juri talking about happenings of the city.</p><p>“The tower is the base of the soldiers and they are in charge of finding Phenomenists in the city. That’s why I knew I had to get Kentaro out as fast as possible after he got discovered,” Nikaido said, but while he seemed to consider adding something he just remained silent, Taisuke giving him a questioning side glance.</p><p>“Back to the topic,” Taisuke said and drew the attention back to Juri.</p><p>“A few weeks ago I saw soldiers chase after a boy. I hid as I was afraid of getting involved, but eventually they got him,” Juri continued.</p><p>“Did you see him use his abilities?” Hiromitsu asked.</p><p>“Kind of. It was raining and I could see that in his panic the water moved with him when he waved his arms around, trying to make them back off. But I feel like he didn’t know much about his own abilities.”</p><p>“A water user,” Nikaido said as his mind drifted off to the day Kentaro accidentally used his abilities, forcing them out of the city.</p><p>“Weeks later though I spotted the same boy walking through the streets,” Juri added, making them all exchange a look.</p><p>“Did he escape?” Wataru asked, but Juri shook his head.</p><p>“He was too calm for that. The soldiers didn’t really pay him any attention, it seemed as if they were even keeping their distance on purpose.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence before Wataru let out a sigh. “I feel like we should have taken Aran a bit more seriously as I fear this will go towards his direction.”</p><p>“It’s not like we never considered his stories to be true,” Hiromitsu interfered as they had never made fun out of Aran or called him a liar, they just didn’t have any reason to attack the city just through what he thought he had seen back then.</p><p>“So he knows something as well, right?” Juri asked.</p><p>“You talked about it?” Hiromitsu asked, but Juri shook his head.</p><p>“I could just somehow sense it in the way he talked about Phenomenists. It’s one thing knowing that they fled the city to be safe from the soldiers, but another to know that they are on their side as we Infirm could easily suffer under them in our own city.”</p><p>Juri had a good point as not all Phenomenists were friendly. Some of them had indeed tried to attack the city, some battles here and there leaving victims on both sides. But that was exactly why they had tried to make Aran forget about the city as much as possible and try and get a steady life here with them.</p><p>“But you saw more, right?” Taiga asked as Juri started shifting a bit more uncomfortably in his chair.</p><p>“The second time I saw the boy I got curious, maybe a bit too curious. I started following him around and just through dumb luck and the soldiers not following him around I managed to sneak after him into one of the research buildings. I don’t even know why I was so stupid to go inside…”</p><p>When Juri clenched his fists, Taiga put his hands over them with a soothing look. “You were not just curious, you were worried and I guess not just for yourself, but for everyone in the city. So while it was indeed dangerous I think you can help a lot of people with your information.”</p><p>“And bring even more danger towards them, like with your village,” Juri said and looked into the round, but no one actually looked scolding.</p><p>“We’re not here to judge you,” Wataru said with a soft smile. “We want to help you as much as we want to help our own people. You don’t have to fear us.”</p><p>Finally Juri nodded and continued. “Inside they had so much going on that I can’t even remember everything. Machines, weapons, gadgets I have never seen in my life. I couldn’t even tell what was dangerous and what was not.”</p><p>“Is there anything in particular you remember?” Hiromitsu asked curiously as he wanted to know what they were up against.</p><p>“The one thing that stood out the most was some kind of cell. But it wasn’t out of metal, it was see-through, yet it was hard as stone as they had trapped a Phenomenist inside of it and he tried to throw fire blasts at it, but he crumbled to the ground after the first few tries.</p><p>They all exchanged a worried look on hearing about that cell as their abilities would usually be able to break even through walls, but this sounded like it wasn’t just a pretty strong material, but also weakening them somehow.</p><p>“The rest I don’t clearly remember. I saw some weapons, normal guns, but I couldn’t tell if they were special or not.”</p><p>“Who were the people around?” Nikaido asked.</p><p>“The boy from before was there. Then there was that one man who observed everything from the side. He looked really pleased with the cell, but also with the way the boy had come back. I feel like he is behind all this research and recruiting Phenomenists.”</p><p>“Recruiting, right…” Taisuke hissed under his breath.</p><p>“Do you think he forced them?” Wataru asked, but Juri could only shrug his shoulders.</p><p>“They looked calm, but not really forced or emotionless, so I couldn’t really tell.”</p><p>“They?” Wataru asked.</p><p>“There was one more Phenomenist in the room. He seemed younger than the researcher, but already too old to have become a Phenomenist just recently.”</p><p>“I wonder if the one in charge is an Infirm?” Hiromitsu said in his thoughts, but once more Juri couldn’t tell.</p><p>“The other one used telekinesis for something random in the facility as if he was just playing around, that’s why I knew he was one, but the researcher didn’t show anything. The last person who entered was also a Phenomenist. He is the one who attacked me when he realized that I was hiding and watching.”</p><p>“Did they talk about anything?” Wataru asked.</p><p>“The Phenomenist who entered told the researcher that some kind of preparations were finally done and they all looked excited about the news. Then he asked what to do with the Phenomenist in the cell and the researcher told them to observe for a bit longer and get rid of him if he wouldn’t change.”</p><p>“Change…?” Nikaido whispered thoughtfully. “Are they giving them some kind of drugs or medicine to make them obedient?”</p><p>“That could be,” Hiromitsu said and nodded. “Something is definitely going one”</p><p>“Did you see anything else? Or have any other information?” Wataru asked.</p><p>“I tried to get out of the room before things could escalate, but then the boy spotted me and without a warning the other Phenomenist shot fire into my direction and I only got away because I stumbled and threw over some boxes in the back of the room. That Phenomenist could also use telekinesis, but luckily the boxes blocked his attempt to stop me.”</p><p>Nikaido looked at Taisuke as the other one seemed to have tensed on the mention of that Phenomenist having both those active abilities, as it wasn’t common. Having a main ability like water, fire or telekinesis together with power transfer was more common and in their village no one possessed two main abilities.</p><p>“I also remember the name of him as the researcher said it when he entered the room,” Juri remembered.</p><p>“And what is his name?” Hiromitsu asked, his look on Taisuke for a second before he looked back at Juri.</p><p>“Tama.”</p><p>Taisuke's reaction had been immediate and he had left the meeting without another word. As calm as the way he left seemed, Nikaido could tell more by now and he gave Hiromitsu and Taiga a nod, hurrying after him.</p><p>Juri looked a bit confused, but Taiga told him to not worry about his brother too much, even though he had also looked kind of pale after hearing Tama’s name.</p><p>Nikaido left the rest to Hiromitsu and dashed after Taisuke who immediately aimed for the forest border after leaving the meeting hall.</p><p>Instead of trying to stop him, Nikaido just followed him on a safe distance until Taisuke finally stopped at a downhill area from where the village couldn't be spotted anymore. He clenched his fists and started screaming as he leant to the front.</p><p>Fire immediately formed around him and when he sank to his knees and let out another scream while hitting the ground, the rocky surface around him cracked and Nikaido made a few steps back as fire emerged from the cracks around him.</p><p>Nikaido didn't need any expansion as he had already caught up to the fact that Tama was the friend who had betrayed Taisuke. Knowing that he was in the city now was definitely a hard blow for Taisuke, yet it was something the other one had definitely already guessed. The few parts Nikaido had heard so far showed that Tama had most likely gone to the city on his free will. Maybe even wanting to end his life as a Phenomenist as he had seemed quite troubled about it. If he was now doing everything out of his own free will or not was questionable, but whatever the city was up to involved him and it would definitely reach their village sooner or later.</p><p>"You fucking asshole," Taisuke roared and hit the ground again, flames emerging once more, but this time Taisuke was running out of energy and he had to stabilize himself. But while he would usually faint after using this much fire, he kept going. Cursing and throwing fire all around him.</p><p>At one point Nikaido was sure that the other one would end up committing suicide if he kept going and while it seemed like suicide from his side as well he dared to make his way over to Taisuke.</p><p>The other one was bending to the front, heavily breathing and unable to get up again. Just when Taisuke let out another roar and lunged out towards the ground, the fire already around his fist, Nikaido had reached him and while he didn't understand where he took the confidence from he closed his hands around Taisuke's fist. He got ready to get burned, but it didn't happen. The fire vanished when he touched the other one's skin and hadn’t caused any damage.</p><p>Taisuke jolted and wanted to pull back, but he had not enough energy left to do so. "Idiot, let go!"</p><p>Instead of letting Taisuke back off, Nikaido moved one arm around Taisuke to pull him against his chest. Taisuke struggled even more on that move, yelling nonstop at the other one to get away from him.</p><p>Taisuke's fire showed up in front of him once more while they were struggling, but Nikaido hurried to trap both of the other one's hands in his own.</p><p>"You're not at fault for what he's doing, so don't punish yourself for it," Nikaido yelled at the other one and forced him to stay put as he was easily overpowering him now. That was also the moment he felt Taisuke's remaining energy running through his own body, but this time something felt slightly different. There was no way Taisuke had accidentally used his power transfer in his rage. So it must have been Nikaido who had taken them from the other one.</p><p>Still confused about what had just happened, Nikaido had to close his arms even more around the other one as Taisuke collapsed to the front, finally too exhausted to keep fighting back. Nikaido carefully put the other one's head on his lap as he sat back, but he needed a moment as well to calm down as he now felt Taisuke's fire inside of him, but he didn't want to release it in this critical situation and after a few deep breaths he actually succeeded in taming the flame inside of him.</p><p>"He'll come for us," Taisuke said in a low voice as he looked up into the sky between the high trees. "He thinks we're demons who don't belong in this world. Now he has what it takes to hunt every single one of us down."</p><p>"But he's still a Phenomenist himself," Nikaido said, but Taisuke shook his head.</p><p>"As weird as it might seem to outsiders, I think his plan will end with his own death."</p><p>That was indeed quite a drastic move. Something Nikaido couldn't understand, on the other hand he had heard of Phenomenists who committed suicide because they couldn't handle their abilities so having someone who didn't just hated his own life, but everyone of his kind to such a degree didn't seem impossible.</p><p>"Nika, I won't be able to face him," Taisuke admitted, his eyes now slightly teary. "He was so confused when he came to the village. Such a shy and nice character. The kids loved him. But the more we trained and I tried to show him that being a Phenomenist wasn't much different from being an Infirm, the more his rage started growing. At some point I couldn't even recognize him anymore."</p><p>"So he left the village behind to go to the city," Nikaido concluded, but there was more to it Taisuke hadn't told him yet.</p><p>"When he realized that we weren't sharing his point of view and wouldn't leave the village, he just took things in his own hands."</p><p>Taisuke tried to sit up and Nikaido helped him. In silence he watched how Taisuke pulled his shirt up his back and with a gasp he looked at the other one's back. His entire back was one big burn mark.</p><p>"He tried to attack the Phenomenists in our village. Myuto and Ryosuke were still not at our village at that time, neither was Aran. Massu was unfortunately out on patrol so he went for Fuma who had been pissed at Tama from the start for his attitude. But Tama had three abilities and was in way more control of them than Fuma."</p><p>Taisuke stopped for a moment and took a shaking breath as he had never talked about that day. A memory that had made him overprotective and skeptical of strangers.</p><p>"Fuma was no match for him and before Mitsu and I could make it to the outer part of the village, Taiga had shown up between them. He had always believed that through kindness he could help people, but Tama was a different case and the moment I saw the fire in Tama's hand I dashed towards them as fast as I could. I made it in time, but just the thought of how easily someone I trusted could have taken away one of the most important people in my life scared me so much that I freaked on the spot. Tama’s attack shouldn’t even have hurt me as fire users are usually immune against burns, yet Tama’s fire left this heavy scar with me. Luckily Mitsu got Fuma and Taiga out of the way before they could get hurt. I was so out of control that I could have easily killed Tama if he had dared to attack, but he vanished. Just like that he left."</p><p>The exhaustion on Taisuke's face wasn't just physical anymore. Those memories were heavy and still not progressed by the other one. They hurt like a knife in the chest and Taisuke took another shaking breath, a few silent tears falling this time.</p><p>Slowly Nikaido pulled the other one's shirt back down and put his arms gently around his upper body.</p><p>"Thank you for finally telling me," Nikaido said in a soothing voice. "I'll swear to you that I won't betray you and I'll be there for you if anyone ever tries to backstab you ever again."</p><p>Taisuke put his hands around the other one's arms as he pulled his back more against Nikaido's chest.</p><p>"I want to believe you," Taisuke said. "I really want to."</p><p>"Then try," Nikaido replied. "For now just try and if I ever give you a reason to lose that trust you can always stop trying."</p><p>***</p><p>"Are you sure?" Juri asked again after Hiromitsu had allowed Taiga to show Juri around the village after the meeting, but Juri was worrying more about Taisuke than Taiga did.</p><p>"He's fine. Nikaido is with him," Taiga said with a smile. Kentaro, who had joined them after the meeting, also nodded.</p><p>"Are they something like best friends?" Juri asked and the boys looked at each other for a moment before they cracked a teasing smile.</p><p>"More like eternal enemies," Kentaro teased.</p><p>"With benefits," Taiga added, making Kentaro laugh even more while Juri raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Massu who had come back from his patrol was following them around the village for now just in case, but he took his distance to not make Juri feel even more uneasy.</p><p>The same as with Kentaro before, Taiga explained where everything was in the village and who was a Phenomenist and who wasn't.</p><p>Kentaro watched them from the back, grinning to himself as Taiga seemed way more excited about showing everything to Juri than he had been back when Kentaro had arrived.</p><p>"Finally allowed around the crowd?" Fuma greeted them as they arrived at the training ground, where Myuto, Aran and Fuma were the only ones training as they had increased the patrolling time.</p><p>"Are we getting to know more too?" Aran asked, trying to not sound too scolding and Taiga immediately nodded.</p><p>"My brother will have a talk with everyone in the meeting hall later, don't worry."</p><p>"Great, until then let's do something more fun?" Myuto asked and Juri tilted his head.</p><p>"Remember that Massu is around," Kentaro warned them.</p><p>“Then let’s give Massu a challenge?” Myuto teased and Aran knew exactly what the other one was up to and while Taiga and Kentaro looked at each other not knowing what was going on, Fuma pushed them and Juri towards the forest.</p><p>“We are allowed around the river, right?” Fuma asked. “Right now Ryosuke and Mitsu are on patrol in the north so nothing for us to worry about.”</p><p>“He will totally scold you for this later,” Taiga said as it dawned on him what they were up to.</p><p>“Us, they will scold us,” Myuto corrected him.</p><p>“What are they talking about?” Juri asked towards Kentaro who could only shrug his shoulders.</p><p>For a while nothing unusual happened. They had walked towards the river, playing around at the riverbank, knowing of course that Massu was watching them.</p><p>“Show him some of your abilities,” Fuma said towards Kentaro after a while.</p><p>“He has seen more than enough of them I think,” Kentaro said as he remembered the chaos at the waterfall. Still a moment Kentaro was more than confused about as once more he had used his abilities in a way he didn’t know he could.</p><p>“We can combine all our abilities,” Myuto said and Fuma of course got immediately excited. Kentaro didn’t have much to say against that and they played around with all their abilities for a while.</p><p>“Impressed?” Taiga asked when Juri kept looking at them in fascination, but also a bit of unease.</p><p>“A bit,” Juri said with a nod.</p><p>“Wait until you see Taisuke exploding, then you will be impressed or dead scared, depending on where you are at that moment,” Aran said, trying to sound a bit teasing, but while he hadn’t been there on the day Taisuke had lost control completely, he had of course heard stories and he never wanted to experience it.</p><p>“What are they up to now,” Taiga asked a bit scolding as he hadn’t missed the nod between Myuto and Fuma before they told Kentaro to try and create a wall of water and the moment Kentaro did so Fuma threw a fire blast into it, making the water splash into the air and that was when Myuto kept the water up there. It was all over the place now, surrounding them and then Fuma threw another fire blast, making the small water drops in the air slowly turn into fog.</p><p>“So that’s it,” Taiga said with a chuckle and while Juri still didn’t understand what was going on, Fuma and Myuto dashed right back to them.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Myuto yelled in excitement as they had formed the fog to get away.</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s safe around here,” Taiga immediately soothed Juri as he looked a bit panicked when the others tried to make them stand up and follow them.</p><p>“We’ll get into so much trouble later,” Kentaro said while shaking his head, but still followed the others with a small smile.</p><p>“Let’s try the lower hillside at the side stream. It’s right around the corner and Massu will definitely look down the main river first,” Myuto said as he took Aran’s wrist and dashed ahead. The smaller one was scolding him for his dumb ideas, yet he looked the most entertained together with him after all. All his worries seemed only half as pressuring when Myuto was around.</p><p>Kentaro walked behind everyone as he wanted to make sure that Massu wasn’t following them or got too angry if they kept running away from him. But then he stopped as he was sure for a moment that Massu had immediately caught up to them. The next second though he realized that the position he thought he had spotted him, couldn't possibly work out as it had been inside the fog over the river. But he was sure that he had seen someone, but the river was fast flowing after all and also too deep for someone to just stand in it.</p><p>“Kentaro, are you coming?” Taiga asked and the other one nodded, hurrying after them. He tried to shake his worries off as all that was going to await them was some scolding later. Concentrating on something else, Kentaro looked at Juri and Taiga. The new boy still seemed to feel uneasy, especially with their sudden hide and seek game, but the way he kept clinging to Taiga so obviously made Kentaro smile. It felt like Taiga had finally found someone who was matching his energy. Of course he was a close friend to Kentaro too by now and the other boys also got along perfectly with Taiga, but with his older brother leading the village and him being the only Infirm it felt like he was always the one who got overprotected and with Juri he had finally someone he could actually support on the same level without getting seen as the weak one.</p><p>“Let’s stay around here for now,” Fuma announced and they jumped down to a small hillside. There weren’t many trees around the area, but it was also hard to spot from the forest. One of the few open grass fields close to the river. Sometimes when the rain was too heavy it would completely fill up with water.</p><p>Myuto started running towards the high grass, but his legs got tangled and he fell over, making Aran and Fuma laugh at him and this time Juri also showed a smile.</p><p>“Are you feeling that bad about us getting into trouble?” Taiga asked after Kentaro hadn’t even realized that he had spaced out and kept looking towards the river while Taiga had walked up to him.</p><p>“No, that’s not it,” Kentaro said and shook his head, trying to form a smile. “Not that I think we will get away with just a bit of scolding. Especially you.”</p><p>Taiga laughed on hearing that as the other one was definitely right. “Then let’s make the best out of it.”</p><p>Kentaro nodded and looked after Taiga who jumped into a puddle of clear water that was still left from a heavy rain day a few days ago and Juri squealed next to him when he got all the water into the face.</p><p>Kentaro chuckled on his reaction and looked at them as Juri tried to kick some water up at the others, Myuto hiding behind Aran who scolded him for not using his abilities to stop the water while Fuma was about to just throw Taiga head first into the next puddle.</p><p>Kentaro turned back to the river one more time and while that move had been to make himself calm down and join the others, he stopped once more. He was sure that his mind was playing tricks on him.</p><p>The first thing he realized was something that couldn’t possibly happen. The river was flowing backwards.</p><p>“What the hell is going on,” Kentaro said as he dared to walk over to the river while the others hadn’t realized what was going on yet. Right next to it he stopped and crouched down. When he put his hand into the water he could feel that something was different. There was something in the water, some energy. The same kind as his! When he looked towards the direction where the water was now flowing to, he realized the next impossible thing. Someone was standing downstream. But not next to the river, on the river!</p><p>Kentaro got up, looking at the other one with wide eyes. The other one didn’t necessarily look dangerous, he even looked kind of playful? He was of tall build, the same as Myuto and with black wavy hair and a teasing smile on his lips. But when Kentaro wanted to take a step back to let the others know about what was going on the boy disappeared. He dropped into the water, but so smooth and fast that it had been no accident.</p><p>The next second a whistle went through the forest and finally the other boys also turned towards Kentaro’s direction. All of them looked ahead to the other side of the river now. Someone was walking up towards them. Hands in his pockets, totally casually as if on a walk and with a challenging smile towards Kentaro. The man was maybe around the same age as Wataru, but he was of strong build with short blonde hair.</p><p>For a moment the man’s eyes wandered off towards the other boys and he formed a lopsided smile and gave a small nod.</p><p>Just for a brief moment Kentaro turned towards the others, all of them as confused as them, except for one of them. Taiga’s look was hard to interpret. It almost seemed like he was annoyed and relieved at the same time, but before Kentaro could ask about it there was a movement right in front of him and the boy who had vanished into the river before grabbed his feet and with a yelp Kentaro was dragged down into the river.</p>

<p> </p><p>"Why are we going back? You can't seriously just leave Kentaro behind," Fuma yelled at Taiga, but the boy had immediately made everyone leave, especially when Myuto and Fuma got ready to attack. Luckily Taiga had enough saying in the village to make his voice heard and they only gave a death glare to the man who slowly moved downstream as if nothing had happened in the first place.</p><p>"He'll be fine," Taiga said as they hurried upstream and then Massu came into sight, a really pissed expression on his face.</p><p>"I'll do the talking, you wait here," Taiga ordered and even though the boys were still looking behind them, still not believing that they had just left Kentaro behind, they obeyed once more and Taiga walked ahead.</p><p>At first Massu crossed his arms to his chest in annoyance, but then his expression changed as he looked downstream, but no one was there anymore.</p><p>Massu made them get back to the village immediately and luckily Hiromitsu and Ryosuke had also just come back from their patrol.</p><p>"You're missing someone," Hiromitsu immediately said as he was sure that Kentaro wasn't with anyone else in the village while the others were gathered.</p><p>"They've gone missing all at once at some point," Massu said with a side glance, making Taiga look to the ground.</p><p>"Then we'll find some punishment for you boys later," Hiromitsu said and the boys groaned.</p><p>"Are we in that much trouble?" Juri asked Aran.</p><p>"Not in the fearing for your life trouble, but Hiromitsu is really mean when it's about punishments."</p><p>"He'll leave the entire harvest of this year to us I can see it," Myuto complained, but that realization made Juri relax as that was something he could definitely deal with.</p><p>"Then let's hear what happened," Hiromitsu said, but lifted his hand when Taiga wanted to explain. "As short as possible."</p><p>Taiga only shrugged his shoulders as if what had happened wasn't a big deal in the first place. "Fine, you want the short version," Taiga said and then his look changed to something more exciting. "Ueda."</p><p>***</p><p>Things had escalated so quickly that Kentaro didn't even have the time to take a deep breath when he got dragged into the water. But while the stream dragged them both with it he didn't panic as he knew that he could trust his abilities. The problem was that his abilities seemed to refuse to attack the boy who was holding him underwater and no matter how awesome his control was, breathing underwater was not one of his skills. But the other boy didn't seem to feel the same way as he had been underwater for quite some time already before he had pulled Kentaro in.</p><p>After struggling for air too much, Kentaro just lunged out for punches and kicks instead and to his surprise the boy let go. Without wasting time Kentaro put all his energy into getting out of the river and he formed a water platform that would lift him out, but the moment he broke through the surface to take a deep breath he had to duck down as a fire blast was thrown right into his direction without a warning. The moment he went back down underwater the boy threw a pressure wave at him. Something Kentaro didn't know was possible even underwater. But now he tried it as well, trying to form a wave inside the water and he was able to block the other one's next attack as both waves collided and formed a maelstrom.</p><p>Before Kentaro could get trapped underwater again he made his way back to the surface, but this time he was prepared and he didn't move when the fire blast came right at him.</p><p>The fire blast hit the water barrier around Kentaro and smoke rose to the sky. The man from before stood at the riverbank while the boy also jumped out of the water and landed gracefully next to him.</p><p>"Oh, that's a fascinating way of using the water,” the boy chirped in excitement while the man nodded, but put his hands back into his pockets as if he hadn’t attacked in the first place. While the water was now moving downstream again, Kentaro had learned how to not get dragged down with it.</p><p>"What the hell do you want from me?” Kentaro hissed at them as he dared to get out of the river on their side as he was sure the boy could easily walk over the river towards him anyway.</p><p>“Ueda-sensei, you made him angry,” the boy teased the older one, but bowed slightly when he got a side glance on his carefree behavior.</p><p>“Are you new in the village?” Ueda asked and just the fact that the other one knew about the village made Kentaro doubt that he was in the worst trouble, but he was still skeptical and refused to reply.</p><p>“Reo, let’s go,” Ueda said and just turned around without another word and the tall boy gave Kentaro a bright smile before he walked after the older one.</p><p>“Wait!” Kentaro yelled from the back, but they just kept walking. While Kentaro should definitely just be happy about them leaving him alone, he got angry at the way Ueda was playing around with him and without even lifting his hand for a direct attack, his anger formed through just clenching his fists and a thin sharp whip from the water moved towards them.</p><p>What happened next had Kentaro stare in astonishment as Reo seemed to be in control of something Kentaro had only been able to use once without even realizing how he had done it.</p><p>Reo had only turned his head, not even lifting his hand and as if appearing out of nowhere, without using the water of the river, an almost invisible wall stopped Kentaro’s attack. So thin that the water floating in the air was almost invisible to the eye. Water that had been picked up from the soil and the air. A technique the others hadn’t seen with other water users until now, but now there was finally someone who could use it.</p><p>But Kentaro’s sudden attack wasn’t going to end with Reo’s small defense move and without a warning Ueda had thrown a fire blast at the exact same time, making Kentaro stumble back as he had to focus on actually getting the water to move this time.</p><p>“Too slow,” Ueda said and appeared right through his fire blast when it vanished into smoke on contact with the water right in front of Kentaro. There was no distance left to fight and Ueda had already put one foot to the front, sweeping Kentaro’s legs easily and the boy landed on the ground. Before he could even think about any other move he flinched when Ueda stopped his fist right in front of his face with fire dancing around it.</p><p>“So much potential, yet no control at all,” Ueda scolded the boy. “You’re thinking way too much for a water user.”</p><p>Once more Ueda backed off and walked away as if nothing had happened, but this time Kentaro didn’t get angry. There was something about Ueda’s aggressive way of fighting that made Kentaro realize how helpless he would actually still be in a serious fight. Seeing Reo using the water easily made it even clearer how bad he was with his own abilities.</p><p>“Wait,” Kentaro let out again, but this time the other two actually stopped as his tone had been different. In a hurry Kentaro got up and dared to approach them without any attempt to attack them.</p><p>Ueda gave him a scanning look as he stopped right in front of them. He hesitated for a moment as he didn’t even know who they were and what they wanted so close to the village, but something told him that this encounter would benefit him if he let his pride step aside for a bit. He slowly looked up towards Reo, but then he realized that he needed to address Ueda. The boy had made it clear, Ueda was the teacher. Even though their abilities were different, Reo wasn’t going to decide anything without Ueda’s approval.</p><p>“I don’t know who you are and what you want here, but as you are fellow Phenomenists I am certain that we are on the same side,” Kentaro started, Ueda giving him an almost mocking smile. A reaction that made Kentaro clench his fists once more, but he succeeded in keeping his abilities out of it this time.</p><p>“So?” Ueda asked when the other one paused once more as he realized how stupid he must sound. After all he had been just attacked by those two and yet he tried to benefit from the situation, they would definitely laugh at him, but he still wanted to ask.</p><p>“Can you teach me how to control my abilities the same way he does?” Kentaro finally asked straightforward and Reo gave Ueda an excited look from the side, but stayed silent as expected.</p><p>“No,” Ueda replied so suddenly that Kentaro stared back at him dumbfounded until Ueda turned away and kept walking upstream. To his surprise Reo didn’t follow and gave him a sign with a head movement to follow Ueda so Kentaro ran after the other one and made sure to block his way.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I feel like you’re going to be a waste of time.”</p><p>“What?” Kentaro asked almost scandalized about that way too direct reply and the way Ueda scanned him from head to toe and let out a sigh made his anger rise again.</p><p>“Look how easily you get angry. As a water user that will stand in your way,” Ueda explained.</p><p>When Ueda tried to just keep going, Kentaro blocked his way once more, but this time Ueda stepped so close to him that Kentaro leant a bit to the back.</p><p>“But you are a fast learner,” Ueda praised him for the first time. “Moving with the flow instead of trying to break a wall with a wave.”</p><p>Kentaro understood the other one’s words as his anger had immediately made him attack around him at first and now he was able to keep it under control. But now he needed to prove to the other one that he could control it at all times and that was something he wouldn’t be able to learn in just a few minutes.</p><p>“Why do you want me to train you?” Ueda asked and Kentaro made a step back on those words. “Don’t come me with any I want to become stronger shit, because then I won’t change my mind.”</p><p>Those words had Reo chuckle in the back, but he kept observing from the side, obviously cheering for Kentaro.</p><p>“I want to know where my place is,” Kentaro replied while he kept looking to the ground. He wasn’t even sure why he had said it and if that was indeed his main goal, but the words had just come out. “I am tired of running and looking over my back, trying to figure out where I belong and who I can trust. I don’t even know myself anymore since I’ve become a Phenomenist.”</p><p>Ueda let out a hum on the other one’s words and then looked over his shoulder. “What do you think? You want a new training mate?”</p><p>“YES,” Reo yelled in excitement and jumped up several times.</p><p>“It’s difficult to find other water users, especially those who seem to be able to control their abilities this well,” Ueda said as he looked back at Kentaro. “But let me warn you, if you say that you want to train under me then you can’t take that back.”</p><p>Kentaro gave the other one a determined look and finally nodded on which Reo jumped at him with a tight hug, making their sudden fight from before seem as if it hadn’t happened in the first place.</p><p>“Then let’s see how much chaos the others have brought up on the village over the past years,” Ueda said as he casually kept walking, Kentaro unable to follow as Reo shook him on the shoulders in excitement.</p><p>“Wait, you know the people from the village?” Kentaro asked, but when Reo finally released him, the boy shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t. But he does.”</p><p>Without any further explanation Reo ran after his teacher and yelled at Kentaro to follow him.</p><p>***</p><p>Instead of walking directly back towards the village, Taisuke and Nikaido had kept walking through the forest. As always Taisuke had fallen silent after he felt like he had shared way too much about his past, but each time he was with Nikaido he just let his guard drop easier than usual.</p><p>“What do you think about Juri’s story?” Taisuke finally asked after they had walked away from the river for quite a while.</p><p>“It doesn’t sound like an impossible story,” Nikaido said, but the way he phrased it made Taisuke give him a knowing look. “But I feel like he got to know a lot of details about things no one should have had access to that easily.”</p><p>“And he got out alive,” Taisuke added, making Nikaido nod.</p><p>“Do you think I am overreacting?” Taisuke asked.</p><p>“I think you have any right to feel skeptical and I bet Mitsu and the others are also not that easily going to believe him. The question now is if what happened was out of his hands. A plan from Tama’s side to make someone deliver a message without him even realizing it or if there is more to the entire situation?”</p><p>“After Tama had left no one came to our village for months. I really hoped everything would just stay that quiet, but with more Phenomenists still getting discovered and getting their abilities, it was just a question of time for more people finding this place.”</p><p>“But until now everyone fit in perfectly, right?” Nikaido asked as he didn’t feel like any members of the village disliked each other no matter if Phenomenist or Infirm.</p><p>“Aran was the first one to arrive and all his talking about the city being up to something made me retreat from everyone even more,” Taisuke explained. “Luckily Myuto joined soon after and he somehow found a connection to the boy in his own annoying way to keep his topics away from everyone.”</p><p>“Not that Aran was telling lies,” Nikaido said as they now knew better as long as Juri wasn’t telling the same exact lies.</p><p>“Juri had seen enough to make it sound realistic at least. Aran just had all his conspiracy theories without any proof,” Taisuke said, but now he felt a bit sorry for him as he hadn’t been that off track with them.</p><p>“Then Ryosuke joined I think?” Nikaido changed back to the topic.</p><p>“Yes, he joined a few months after Myuto. The others were already all in the village so for good a year it had fallen silent until you arrived.”</p><p>“Did you give all of them the harsh greeting we got?” Nikaido asked with a teasing smile, making Taisuke roll his eyes.</p><p>“Your timing was bad, that was all.”</p><p>“Oh so everyone else really got a nicer welcome?” Nikaido asked once more, now shoving Taisuke a bit to the side, making the older one chuckle.</p><p>“Hey, at least you knew what was going to await you if you stayed,” Taisuke teased back and hit the other one against the shoulder.</p><p>“So you don’t mind us staying anymore?” Nikaido asked a bit more seriously this time and Taisuke stopped for a moment, looking at the other one.</p><p>“I want you to stay,” Taisuke let out with a nod. “Actually-”</p><p>“Actually what?” Nikaido asked when Taisuke stopped and shook his head as if he was about to say something he felt embarrassed about.</p><p>“Nevermind. It’s nothing.”</p><p>Nikaido pouted on the way Taisuke dropped the topic and he poked him several times to make the other one say it, but Taisuke shook the other one off and ran ahead yelling at him to stop.</p><p>Right at a clearing with a rocky surface close to where one of their biggest mountain ranges started, Taisuke wanted to run back to the river, but Nikaido had caught up to him, yet he received such a harsh pull on his upper arm that he wanted to scold Nikaido when he was almost thrown off his feet.</p><p>Yet when he turned his head, the other one gave him a sign to remain silent and pointed ahead before he pulled Taisuke behind a few trees.</p><p>“Someone is over there,” Nikaido whispered, but Taisuke couldn’t spot anyone. “I saw someone casually walking down towards the river, I am sure of it. He didn’t look like a soldier, but he was too far away to say for sure.”</p><p>“But we’re up in the north,” Taisuke whispered back. “Except for soldiers, no one would attack us from here.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Taisuke let out a weird noise between a pout and a hum, making Nikaido tilt his head at him.</p><p>“What is it?” Nikaido asked, but then got pulled into the direction of the river.</p><p>“Just try to stay as hidden as possible. Don’t let him see you.”</p><p>“Are you out of your mind?” Nikaido asked, but something about Taisuke’s behavior made him tag along for now. They should somehow be able to handle a single soldier if it was indeed one.</p><p>A few moments later they could hear voices, still far away, but they didn’t sound like fighting noises.</p><p>“Why do I think that they are not supposed to be down here?” Nikaido asked scolding as he spotted Kentaro first, standing at the other side of the river, while Taiga and the others were still a bit at the back, but something didn’t feel right.</p><p>“What are they looking at?” Nikaido asked as he realized that Kentaro was staring down at the river, but then lifted his head towards the forest while the others also approached and looked in the same direction on the sound of a whistle.</p><p>“There he is,” Taisuke said as calm as Nikaido hadn’t expected him to be as Taiga was with the others. Usually that was enough to make Taisuke freak at everyone who tried to approach.</p><p>Nikaido looked at the man who seemed to be the one he had spotted before. Blonde hair and casual clothes, no soldier. But what was he doing here?</p><p>The situation escalated when Kentaro suddenly let out a gasp as he got dragged down into the river.</p><p>“Don’t,” Taisuke said and grabbed Nikaido’s arm when the other one wanted to dash to his little brother’s rescue. Nikaido was angry enough to lose his patience in a second and he was about to punch Taisuke right into the face for a second time as the other one was always the overprotective older brother so he couldn’t understand why he would stop him. Yet Taisuke was faster and used his power transfer to make Nikaido stumble and at the same time he pulled him down into a sitting position.</p><p>“Don’t you dare steal my abilities now,” Taisuke hissed at the other one. “Listen, okay?”</p><p>“Talk fast then,” Nikaido barked back, trying to spot what was going on at the river.</p><p>“I hope this coming from me will make you believe my words,” Taisuke started. “This person is one of the few I trust with my life. Am I clear?”</p><p>At first Nikaido hadn’t listened as he was too restless, but then he turned to Taisuke with wide eyes. After everything he had just told him about Tama and how hard it was for him to trust Juri or even let Nikaido and Kentaro stay in the first place, he had just told him that this stranger was a trustworthy person?</p><p>“You know them?” Nikaido asked, finally calming down a bit.</p><p>“I know Ueda,” Taisuke said with an excited look. “The other boy I don’t know, but he seems to be a water user like your brother.”</p><p>“But what are they doing here?” Nikaido asked and looked back up just to find Taiga’s group retreating from the river, while Ueda was almost out of sight towards the other direction.</p><p>“He will definitely tell us that later, but want to watch for now?”</p><p>“Watch what?” Nikaido asked as he was still speechless about Taiga and the others casually leaving, but when even Taisuke said that he trusted that man, then it seemed to be the same for Taiga.</p><p>“Ueda’s more than questionable training methods,” Taisuke said and Nikaido wanted to slap him for saying it in such excitement.</p><p>***</p><p>“Oh, look at who is back first,” Myuto said when he spotted Nikaido and Taisuke.</p><p>“Do not tell them anything I warn you,” Massu said the moment Taiga jumped up from one of the benches close to the meeting hall.</p><p>“Right, because it is so damn unsuspicious that we are all gathered around here,” Taiga teased.</p><p>Hiromitsu had made the boys stay with Wataru and Ryosuke while he and Massu had taken charge of making his round through the village so that people wouldn’t freak out about more new arrivals. Not that this one was a new one.</p><p>But when Hiromitsu had told Miyata and his kids had immediately ran back into the house with his mum laughing at them, Aran raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“So who is that Ueda again?” Aran asked skeptically, before Taisuke and Nikaido were close enough to hear them.</p><p>“He’s one of the three founders, did you even listen?” Wataru said from the side, still pissed at the boys for running off earlier.</p><p>“That is not much of an explanation,” Fuma agreed, but didn’t bother getting up from the bench on which he was lying flat on his back.</p><p>“The details can wait for later, just one warning,” Wataru said and got everyone’s attention. “Don’t get in his way. You will regret it.”</p><p>“Sounds scary enough to stay away,” Ryosuke said, but seemed excited to meet him. “Shouldn’t we call Massu back as well before he arrives?”</p><p>“Not yet. It’s better if he joins later,” Wataru said.</p><p>“Why is that?” Myuto asked curiously as he sat on the grass with outstretched legs.</p><p>“They have a few things to settle,” Wataru said, but then fell silent when Nikaido and Taisuke walked up towards them.</p><p>Juri remained next to Aran, while Taiga walked up to them.</p><p>“Everything alright?” Taiga asked as he of course knew that Taisuke had been in a miserable state earlier when he had left the meeting in a hurry and Juri looked sorry as well, while it wasn’t his fault of course.</p><p>“All good, don’t worry,” Taisuke said and ruffled through the younger one’s hair. “How about everything here? Having another meeting?”</p><p>“Babysitting the runners,” Wataru let out, making the boys bow a bit, except for Fuma who chuckled.</p><p>“It was fun though,” Fuma said as Nikaido walked up to him.</p><p>“Leaving my brother behind seemed to have been fun as well I guess?”</p><p>On those words Fuma tried to sit up and turn at the same time, ending with him falling from the bench right in front of the older one.</p><p>“Taiga made us,” Fuma immediately stuttered and pointed at the other boy.</p><p>When Nikaido started laughing, Fuma blinked in confusion and leant over to Myuto who had tried to crawl away a bit from the bench.</p><p>“Did he lose it now?”</p><p>“Idiots, they know,” Taiga said with a smile and gave Taisuke an excited look.</p><p>“We indeed do. We saw what happened,” Taisuke said and turned towards the forest. “Which means we will soon get company.”</p><p>And sooner than they thought Ueda and the two boys came into sight at the forest border after Taisuke and Nikaido had left after observing for a while longer than Taiga and the others did.</p><p>“Was he too harsh on him?” Taiga whispered towards Taisuke, but the older one shook his head.</p><p>“I would say he was too nice,” Taisuke said with a chuckle. “But I doubt he will continue being that nice, especially with the potential Kentaro showed him.”</p><p>“Now I have to watch out to not become the overprotective older brother,” Nikaido said as he sighed. It had been hard enough to watch from the sideline before and he knew it would be even harder to keep watching their training from now on.</p><p>“What a welcome. I guess the boys couldn’t wait to tell you,” Ueda teased as he joined the group at the meeting hall and now all the boys got up to their feet, Juri still remaining a bit in the background as he was still overwhelmed with being around all the new people in the village and having someone like Ueda showing up at this timing, had him even more intimidated.</p><p>But the next moment Taiga walked up to him and hooked his elbow with his and pulled him a bit to the back when Hiromitsu came back to greet Ueda and for a moment the older ones had a serious talk.</p><p>“Don’t worry about them too much. Ueda is not a bad person and while he will shout a lot at training, you will not have much to do with him. Just stick with me and the boys.</p><p>Juri slowly nodded as that was definitely the best thing to do for now.</p><p>“Had a nice swim?” Nikaido asked when Kentaro walked up to him.</p><p>“Wait, you saw us?” Kentaro asked, now seeming kind of embarrassed.</p><p>“Taisuke, always bad at sneaking around, like always,” Ueda greeted the other one and hit him so hard on the shoulder that Taisuke let out a hiss. “And I see that you’ve gotten a lot new company.”</p><p>Ueda’s look fell on the boys first, Fuma, Aran, Myuto, Ryosuke and Juri all new faces to him. He gave them all a scanning look before he pointed at Fuma. “You suck at controlling your abilities.”</p><p>While Fuma let out a snort on hearing that, the other boys started laughing.</p><p>“He isn’t wrong, you know?” Myuto laughed, but then fell silent when Ueda pointed at him next.</p><p>“You need more than just a bit of work on your physical strength, because otherwise even a chaos loaded guy like him can totally beat you, no matter how good your telekinesis is.”</p><p>“What? How?” Myuto stuttered as he hadn’t in any way shown him what abilities he possessed.</p><p>Ueda just kept going and stopped at Aran, the boy wanting to step back as he wasn’t a Phenomenist, but Ueda still pointed at him. “You’ve the cool head a lot of these boys could actually need.”</p><p>Fuma immediately let out a laugh on hearing that as that wasn’t the way he would describe Aran, but Myuto actually nodded with a proud smile towards the smaller one as he knew that Aran could be more concentrated than all of them at training and possessed an extremely sharp tactical thinking.</p><p>“You,” Ueda went on as he pointed at Ryosuke, the boy waiting patiently for a reaction. But then Ueda tilted his head as if he wasn’t sure for the first time. “Quite some power control, interesting.”</p><p>That was all he said and Ryosuke shrugged his shoulders as he seemed satisfied with that reply.</p><p>Ueda looked at Taiga who he already knew of course and then his eyes met Juri’s insecure look as the boy stepped a bit behind Taiga.</p><p>“Interesting,” Ueda let out without any other explanation and turned back towards Taisuke. Then his look fell on Nikaido.</p><p>“You’re his older brother,” Ueda said and looked at Kentaro.</p><p>“Right,” Nikaido replied calmly.</p><p>“So you agree with his decision to train under me?”</p><p>“Not sure about that,” Nikaido said and gave his little brother a side glance. “But he decided that for himself, so now he has to keep his word.”</p><p>“Wise words,” Ueda said with a lopsided smile. “Then let’s not disturb everyone’s work. Mitsu, can we have a talk inside?”</p><p>Hiromitsu nodded and told the boys to go back to their daily routine. Some of them had to get ready for patrolling, others had duties on the fields or upcoming training.</p><p>Only Wataru and Hiromitsu stayed with Ueda.</p><p>“What am I supposed to do?” Reo asked while he had been standing in the back quietly until now.</p><p>“Do what you do best, make some friends,” Ueda teased and left the boy to the others and Reo immediately looked excited about that and grabbed Kentaro’s arm.</p><p>“Introduce me!” Reo yelled and dragged Kentaro towards the others.</p><p>“It’s going to be quite noisy for a while,” Nikaido said with a sigh.</p><p>“You’re always welcome at my hut if yours is getting too noisy.”</p><p>On Taiuske’s words the younger one turned to him, but Taisuke had immediately turned away and walked down towards the fields instead. Way faster than he needed to, but Nikaido only smiled after him.</p>
