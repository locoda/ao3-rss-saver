The war which had started through the humans' never-ending greed and search for ultimate power had now turned into a war against their own.<br/>Phenomenists, the carriers of special abilities were hunted by those who feared their abilities and with the lack of knowledge and control, their goal soon changed from research to extinction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hey everyone^^/</p><p>I am finally back with a new work or more with a re-edited work. Some of you might have read parts of this several years ago. I wasn't satisfied with my writing and the story at that time so I deleted it and now it is ready to be completely posted as a re-edit! You might find similarities to my previous series (Battle of Evolution) as this work is the original idea for it</p><p>I didn't post any exact age for characters, but you will notice while reading that some of them are supposed to be still young adults/teenagers and have a way bigger age gap to other characters than in real life, I leave the ages to your imagination :)</p><p>Hope you enjoy reading and as always pls excuse grammar mistakes and plot holes. Enjoy~</p></blockquote>

</p><p>“I am sorry. I didn’t want to…” Kentaro let out between his sobs, but there was no time for apologies and Nikaido grabbed his little brother by the wrist and pulled him away before the people who had seen him could actually call the guards.</p><p>Years they had lived in the eastern city, as peaceful as it was possible in this post war time, but then Kentaro suddenly became one of them. One of those people which weren’t allowed in any city, but they couldn’t easily leave either. The country was destroyed, just a few major cities still somehow capable of keeping the order. Huge fences, which had at first been a defense over years of wars with other countries, were now surrounding them to keep the so called Phenomenists away from the cities. Helping a Phenomenist was forbidden and punished with death, but how could he leave his own brother behind?</p><p>For a few weeks they had managed, but Kentaro’s abilities were becoming too obvious, his emotions too hard to control and the heavy rain had made things even worse. Water was what he could control, one of the four existing abilities a Phenomenist could have and it wasn’t even clear yet if he also possessed others as well.</p><p>A routine control had escalated when soldiers had found Kentaro suspicious without even doing anything and they had threatened to bring him to the tower, the center of the city. Kentaro wanted to stop them, but without using his abilities he would have been no match and because he couldn’t control his abilities yet and his brother wasn’t around to help him, he was easily exposed when he tried to attack one of the soldiers, but it was a wave of water coming from one of the paddles of the ground hitting the person instead of a punch.</p><p>Nikaido had luckily reached them soon enough to prevent the worst from happening and he used the chaos to flee with Kentaro, but now they were in big trouble. The whole city was equipped with cameras, the next armed guard definitely not far away and while they wouldn’t see Nikaido as their enemy just like this, it would be different the moment all the soldiers around them got to know about his little brother being a Phenomenist.</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Kentaro sobbed as he got dragged along on which Nikaido’s grip on his wrist tightened.</p><p>“Stop apologizing. It’s not like you did something bad, they are the assholes,” Nikaido hissed and tried to somehow come up with an escape plan. The sounds of trucks passing by at the main road made him stop and pull Kentaro behind him. They were on their way out of the city to get supplies.</p><p>“That’s our chance,” Nikaido whispered and turned to his brother. “Whatever happens I want you to run in case they get me.”</p><p>“What? I will never leave you behind!”</p><p>“If they get you, they will kill you!”</p><p>“They will also kill you for helping me,” Kentaro said, shaking his head nonstop. When his tears started falling again the rain that had fallen the entire day already seemed to become even heavier.</p><p>Nikaido hurried to take his brother’s face into his hands and wipe away the tears, trying to sooth him. “Calm down, okay? It’s not like I want us to get separated, you know that! I don’t care if you have become a Phenomenist or not. But now we can’t stay anymore. We knew this day could come.”</p><p>Kentaro nodded immediately, because they were the last members of their family, the only ones who had survived the war. Kentaro had still been too young to even remember their parents, so Nikaido was his only family and he knew that his brother would never turn his back on him.</p><p>The sound of the gate opening made Nikaido turn back to the corner. “We have no time, let’s go. We can’t think about failing now!”</p><p>Kentaro tried to get a grip and concentrate as well as they dashed out of their hiding place, sneaking on the back of one of the empty supply trucks under the cover of the heavy rain.</p><p>“Get down,” Nikaido whispered and they hid behind the empty boxes while the trucks were driving out of the city.</p><p>On the faint sound of the gate closing again Nikaido finally relaxed and sat against the side of the truck.</p><p>“I guess we can relax for a bit now and as soon as we’re far enough, let's get off.”</p><p>When there was no reply Nikaido looked over to his brother who was lying on his back, but when he took a closer look, he realized that Kentaro had once more fainted. Using their abilities usually made Phenomenists feel exhausted and there were even rumors about them being at risk of heavier damage when they used their abilities too much so Nikaido wanted to make sure to become strong as well even without any abilities so that Kentaro didn’t have any reason to use them to a dangerous degree.</p><p>***</p><p>A nuclear war had turned the world upside down several years ago. New weapons, new chemicals, new miscalculations. Whole countries had been destroyed, population erased and then the humans themselves had started changing. A mutation as a lot of people called it at first, but it wasn’t that easy. Men were changing, women weren’t, the reason for that was the y chromosome which was attacked by a virus which circled over the whole planet after hundreds of different chemical and nuclear weapons had infested land and water.</p><p>The war which had started through the humans' never-ending greed and search for ultimate power had now turned into a war against their own. Those who had shown the mutations were taken to research centers at first, but soon the situation escalated as a lot of them couldn’t control their abilities at first.</p><p>The plan on research had been changed to a plan of extinction and at first it seemed like the mutation carrier, called Phenomenists by the researchers, were about to get extinct, but then suddenly new people became Phenomenists after months even years after the war and they realized that the mutation could still take place years later. Mainly children or young adults would suddenly turn or more like awaken their abilities, mostly after being triggered by a dangerous situation. Major cities started to force their citizens into regular DNA tests with which they could uncover the Phenomenists.</p><p>A lot of them had gone into hiding, afraid of getting found and killed, others had enough and attacked the people trying to kill them.</p><p>In the end humanity had been forced into two groups, the humans without mutations, called Infirm, hiding in their huge cities, surrounded by high fences and armed guards and the Phenomenists, hiding outside the danger zones, trying to form a new life on their own.</p><p>While everything had calmed down at first as the cities weren’t directly attacked by any Phenomenists, there was a new uproar inside their own fences now. Even years after separation between both groups, there were still people suddenly changing into Phenomenists. The cities’ guards would immediately execute those who showed any kind of mutation. With the fear of getting killed in their own city there were also those who decided to leave and live alongside the Phenomenists, but it was only a matter of time until one of both groups would start another uproar, but with the number of Phenomenists rising, another civil war could have a destructive outcome.</p><p>***</p><p>“Don’t walk that fast, we are not getting followed,” Nikaido said as Kentaro kept moving straight ahead through the forest even though they had no clue where they had ended up. At some point Nikaido had decided that it was better to get off the truck, but as expected there was nothing around.</p><p>“I just, I don’t know, it feels like this is a good direction.”</p><p>“A good direction for what?” Nikaido asked confused, on which Kentaro stopped and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“No clue actually, just a gut feeling?”</p><p>A pretty strong gut feeling that was for sure, because it was rare to see Kentaro that determined, especially after what had happened just hours before.</p><p>This behavior was definitely one Nikaido preferred though, so he just followed his little brother through the woods until he could hear a sound.</p><p>“A river?”</p><p>“Take a look at this,” Kentaro shouted, already out of Nikaido’s sight and the older one hurried towards him. A waterfall and fast flowing river were what awaited him at a small cliff where Kentaro was standing.</p><p>“Wow, that’s amazing,” Nikaido let out.</p><p>“Let’s take a rest here for now?” Kentaro asked and Nikaido nodded immediately. They had had no time to bring anything with them, so a place where they had fresh water which was not in any way chemically loaded like the city water, was definitely something they needed.</p><p>“We can go down here,” Kentaro said as he found a place where they could easily get down to the riverside.</p><p>Nikaido looked after his little brother with a thoughtful expression, but Kentaro was already running towards the water. This wasn’t just a gut feeling, that was for sure. Being able to sense the water from such a distance was definitely connected to his abilities and Nikaido could just hope that everything connected to them would stay this positive.</p><p>“Let’s try and make a fire, it's getting dark,” Nikaido said as he picked a bit of wood up on the way. At least it wasn’t raining out here in the woods, but it was definitely going to be quite cold at night.</p><p>“Would be awesome if we could somehow get some fish to eat,” Kentaro said as he stared at the river, seeing some trouts swimming by.</p><p>“Don’t you dare and step in there, the current is way too strong it will drag you along,” Nikaido warned him as he sat down on a bigger stone at the riverbank and tried to start a fire with what they had gathered. They hadn’t been able to gather any of their belongings on their way out of the city, so they had no provisions or anything else that could help them out here.</p><p>Kentaro kept staring at the river for the time being as if the river itself could give him a fish or two instead of him going in and trying to get it.</p><p>“At least something that worked out,” Nikaido said relieved as a few sparks finally made the dry wood catch fire. A squeal from his little brother made him look up right away, ready to scold him in case he had actually dared to go into the river. What he saw though was making him blink in confusion.</p><p>“Don’t ask me, I have no clue! It jumped into my arms I swear!” Kentaro defended himself as he held a huge trout, still trying to get out of his grip.</p><p>“So what, the river gave you the fish?” Nikaido teased him, but then he realized that it wasn’t as weird as it sounded at first. Kentaro’s abilities were connected to water after all. The city forbad it to learn about Phenomenists and their abilities so they didn’t know much, but what they had heard was that the abilities were becoming stronger or weaker depending on the emotional condition of the person and Kentaro was desperate for food, so maybe he had subconsciously moved the water to get the fish.</p><p>“Well now that you have it already let’s eat it,” Nikaido said, shrugging his shoulders, trying to play the confusion about all the weird happenings down, because he could already see that Kentaro was also overwhelmed with his own abilites.</p><p>As expected, it turned dark pretty soon and unfortunately, they had nothing but the fire to keep themselves warm and Nikaido sat down next to Kentaro.</p><p>“You need to sleep a bit, come lie down,” Nikaido said and clapped on his own thighs on which Kentaro shook his head.</p><p>“I am not so tired. You should sleep first.”</p><p>“I am the older brother, no complaints!”</p><p>Luckily that was a tactic that always worked and a bit reluctantly Kentaro finally tried to find a somehow comfortable position and put his head on his brother’s legs.</p><p>“Where do we go from here? Do you think they will try and find us?”</p><p>Kentaro had turned on the side, but Nikaido could read the worry in his voice and he put his hand on the boy’s hair. “They won’t try to come after us, don’t worry. They left the Phenomenists outside of the cities alone for now and just attacked those who dared to come close to the city. So as long as we don’t try to go back it’s going to be fine.”</p><p>If it eventually would be fine, he couldn’t tell of course, but as the older brother he wanted to make sure that Kentaro didn’t have to worry that much. “We might find some abandoned places to get supplies.”</p><p>As there was no reply at all, Nikaido leaned a bit to the front, smiling as he realized that Kentaro had already fallen asleep. “Not tired, right…” he whispered with a chuckle.</p><p>***</p><p>When the morning arrived Nikaido realized that he had fallen asleep at some point after all and what made him wake up even faster was the fact that Kentaro was not lying next to him. When he sat up and took a look around, he found the boy next to the river.</p><p>“What are you doing this early in the morning?” Nikaido asked as he walked up to his brother.</p><p>“I tried to get us another fish, but it won’t work.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it too much. You don’t even know how you did that or if it really was just a coincidence so let’s keep moving.”</p><p>Nikaido was totally understanding his little brother’s bad mood after not being able to control the abilities which he had been given without even wanting them, but maybe time would bring him answers or they were lucky and would meet other Phenomenists who could actually help him.</p><p>“So where shall we go?”</p><p>“Why do you ask me that?” Kentaro asked in confusion.</p><p>“Because your gut feeling brought us here, so maybe it can bring us to another good spot after this?”</p><p>It had been meant to be just a bit of teasing, but unfortunately Kentaro’s mood turned even worse. “I can’t even tell how my abilities work so it might be better to not trust me with this.”</p><p>Nikaido patted him on the shoulder before he chose a direction randomly to head off to. “Don’t worry there will be a day when you can make good use out of them.”</p><p>If Kentaro even wanted that was still unclear, but what else than trying to support him could Nikaido do? If he could he would take the powers away from him, but that was something he of course wasn’t capable of.</p><p>A second night had them left in the middle of the forest without food or water, but they kept walking through a thick forest the next day while they had to slow down as their surroundings got more and more steep, leading them into the mountains.</p><p>“If we go too high, I fear it will become even colder in the evenings,” Kentaro let out worried and Nikaido nodded.</p><p>“Let’s see if we can find somewhere alongside the mountain where it’s easy to walk.”</p><p>After a few more minutes in the thick forest, they suddenly reached an area where it got easier to walk and they scanned their surroundings.</p><p>“It almost looks like a path,” Kentaro said as two open areas were visible in front of them.</p><p>“Now the question is just which way do we go?” Nikaido asked while he had walked up to the area that lead up the mountain, but then he realized that Kentaro wasn’t even listening to him. He had already made a few steps onto the path ahead, looking concentrated into the forest.</p><p>“Kentaro?” Nikaido asked, but didn’t get a reply on which he stepped closer and waved his hand in front of the boy’s face. “Hey, everything okay?”</p><p>Kentaro flinched on the move as if he had totally forgotten that he wasn’t alone. “Sorry, I just, I don’t know, forget it…”</p><p>“You think we should go that way, right?” Nikaido analyzed his behavior and he knew he was right when Kentaro bit his lip.</p><p>“I know I said earlier we shouldn’t rely on this weird gut feeling ,but I really think we should go this way,” Kentaro explained, to which Nikaido gave him a smile.</p><p>“Then it’s decided, let’s go!”</p><p>It didn’t matter if they trusted Kentaro’s feeling or not, they just had two directions to choose from anyways.</p><p>The path got even clearer after a while, but the forest continued as before with the difference that they weren’t getting even more up into the mountains, but followed on the side of it.</p><p>“Do you hear that?” Nikaido asked and they both stopped, listening to the sound they could hear.</p><p>“I have a bad feeling about this,” Kentaro said, but kept walking, because what was awaiting them wasn’t dangerous, as long as they didn’t have to pass it, but luck didn’t seem on their side as they found a huge waterfall in front of them after a bit more of walking.</p><p>The waterfall was coming from the rocks right over the path and made it impossible to keep going as the water hit the path with full force and would make them fall and looking down the waterfall continued quite a long way.</p><p>“So are we turning around?” Nikaido asked a bit disappointed about the sudden dead end.</p><p>Kentaro walked a bit closer to the waterfall though, but there was no way around it. “Don’t you think this is strange?”</p><p>“Why?” Nikaido asked and stepped next to him.</p><p>“The path continued completely clearly until here and suddenly it stops like this? I doubt a lot of people would randomly walk up here and then turn around.”</p><p>“Maybe people live nearby and get their water from here?” Nikaido said, trying to find an explanation.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be easier to get the water down where the waterfall ends then instead of walking up here?”</p><p>“Also true,” Nikaido said defeated. “Anyways, let’s head back. It’s getting dark soon so we should find somewhere to rest close by so we have water for the night.”</p><p>Already looking around if he could spot a good place to try and make another fire, he didn’t realize that Kentaro wasn’t following him until he turned around. Looking back to the waterfall he realized that his brother had disappeared. “Kentaro?”</p><p>Not wanting to panic right away he tried to spot him in the forest, maybe he had tried to find a way around, but there was no sign of him on which Nikaido dashed back to the waterfall, panic rising fast now. Had he fallen? But he would have shouted out for him if he had lost his balance or slipped.</p><p>“Kentaro, where are you?” Nikaido shouted this time, but again no answer. When he was ready to actually turn and dash down back the path to see if Kentaro had actually really fallen, a movement on his side made him jolt and jump to the sight.</p><p>“What the actual fuck?” He said in pure disbelief about a hand being stretched out to him from inside the waterfall. The next moment Kentaro stepped half out of it, looking at his brother as confused as the other way around.</p><p>“What are you doing? What- How…?”</p><p>Kentaro was standing under the full force of the waterfall, but the water didn’t even touch him. Like an invisible wall it seemed to flow around him. “I have no clue why, but I suddenly had the feeling I could go through it and I tried. So take my hand and come with me, because I have the feeling if I think about this too much it might not work anymore.”</p><p>There was so much speaking against trying this, because trying meant they could fail. Who said that Nikaido would be even able to follow Kentaro without getting crushed? He was an Infirm after all.</p><p>“Trust me,” Kentaro said and stretched out his hand. Seeing his little brother this confident about his still unexplored abilities made Nikaido finally move and he took his hand and dared his first step under the crushing water and it worked. The shield seemed to protect them both and so Nikaido made sure to walk as close to Kentaro as possible.</p><p>It was making Nikaido feel proud of his little brother to see how he tried so hard to make the best use of this abilities, but with the water crushing down right above them he couldn’t concentrate on anything else than the question when they would be through and luckily his question got answered seconds later and they finally arrived back on the path.</p><p>“I knew it,” Kentaro said as he looked ahead at the clear path. “This waterfall is something like a barricade for protection.</p><p>“You mean whoever uses this path wants Infirms to stay outside.” It wasn’t even sounding that weird, because Infirms had hunted Phenomenists down for years so they were definitely not fond of them.</p><p>“Let’s see where it leads to,” Kentaro said and kept walking. They kept walking for quite some time, the path not continuing this clearly after a while, with the forest showing rocky surfaces on one side and thick forest to the other side, but Kentaro kept going as if he knew exactly where he aimed for. Just after quite some time of walking when Nikaido doubted that they were reaching any certain place at all after losing the direct path, Kentaro suddenly stopped.</p><p>“What is it?” Nikaido asked and followed the boy’s look through the forest. Then he saw the movement. There was someone hiding behind the trees. “Kentaro, wait!”</p><p>But Kentaro dared to make a few steps forward and when he came into a dangerous distance for both sides, they suddenly saw who had been hiding. Two kids dashed out of their hiding place, running off into the opposite direction. A girl and a boy, definitely still younger than ten.</p><p>Kentaro and Nikaido exchanged a worried look, but then decided to carefully follow them. They hadn’t intended to scare them, but they didn't know that there were people around.</p><p>“Look there is a glade!” Kentaro said as he saw the last sunlight before the dawn breaking through the trees. The place in front of them wasn’t just a small place though. They could see over a huge place without trees and in the middle was a village. All sides were thick forest, but between the village and them was a wide-open area with nothing but grass on it.</p><p>“Shall we try and talk to the people here?” Kentaro asked, a bit worried as he saw the two kids running back towards the few first huts on their way and on that way the boy suddenly stopped at a wooden pole and he rang the bell on it before he also vanished between the huts. There were just small buildings out of wood, except for one bigger building in the middle of the village which had obviously been made out of the stones they got from the steep walls in the mountains. But with the evening hours approaching no one was out in the open fields around them.</p><p>When they finally dared to move out on the grass to walk down to the village they saw more movement down between the buildings.</p><p>The first person coming into their sight walked past the last huts with big steps and Nikaido automatically walked in front of Kentaro, not liking the way they got approached.</p><p>“Be careful there is a small stream in front of you,” Kentaro warned him and pulled on his sleeve before he could actually stumble over it. It wasn’t wide nor deep, but it seemed to surround the whole village.</p><p>“Thank you,” Nikaido said before he wanted to make a small jump over it, but then shouting down in the village made them both look up.</p><p>They were too far away to hear them clearly, but there was a second person running after the man who was approaching them. Before they could decide what to do though a movement of the man made them both freeze.</p><p>Without any kind of warning fire was forming in front of him and even worse it was moving towards them. The fire blast was huge and way too fast to even think about running from it.</p><p>“Get down!” Nikaido shouted at Kentaro, but when he wanted to drag him down, Kentaro jumped in front of him. Nikaido feared for him to get burned alive, but Kentaro didn’t seem afraid at all. When the fire blast was right in front of them, he lifted his arms and with that he moved the water of the stream into a wall turning the fire into smoke.</p><p>Nikaido was out of words through that sudden move, because it seemed like Kentaro was always able to control his abilities at exactly the right moments.</p><p>“Stop it! You don’t have to attack them!”</p><p>Now the voices were clearer, but that also meant they were close by. Before Nikaido could decide what to do he saw Kentaro stumbling to the back. At the same moment he saw another blast of fire coming through the smoke, but this time the person from before had the fire still right in front of him, jumping over the stream ready to attack. Nikaido sank to his knees, catching Kentaro as the boy fell unconsciously into his arms before he turned towards the person attacking them. To his surprise the man who was around the same age as him, stopped his attack and stepped right in front of them, the fire still visible in front of his hand.</p><p>“Who are you?” The man asked in a dangerous tone. He had brown wavy hair, already a bit too long for Nikaido’s liking, but that wasn’t important at the moment. In a physical fight he was sure he could beat the slim figure in front of him, but against a Phenomenist he had no chance.</p><p>Before Nikaido could reply the person in front of him yelped as he got hit on the back of his head, losing his fire and rubbing his head with a curse. “What the heck was that for?” He asked as he turned to a boy coming out of the finally resolving smoke.</p><p>“That is my question! Taisuke, I told you not to attack them. Can’t you for once not be this suspicious about people?”</p><p>It surprised Nikaido to see how the older one pouted on the younger one’s reaction, but a groan from Kentaro made him focus back on his little brother.</p><p>“He must be exhausted after using his abilities in such a hurry. Come, I will bring you to our doctor,” the boy said, to which the older one gave him a disbelieving look.</p><p>“Taiga, are you out of your mind? We don’t even know them. I won’t let them get into the village like this.”</p><p>The younger one rolled his eyes immediately and pointed back at the village. “Didn’t you hear what Hana and Ken said? They came from the waterfall.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make them good people!”</p><p>“For god’s sake Taisuke, look at them,” Taiga yelled this time, Nikaido tightening his grip around Kentaro a bit more as both their attention was back on them. “They aren’t even wet, so they both made it through with the boy’s ability. You know how much trust is needed to make an Infirm be able to follow through that. And you just saw yourself how he deflected your attack with his abilities.”</p><p>“Just because they trust each other, doesn’t mean they are good people.”</p><p>“And you are?” Nikaido said, not being able to stay silent anymore.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Taisuke shot back annoyed.</p><p>“You attacked us out of the blue. We didn’t do anything!”</p><p>“You are here, that is already enough!” Taisuke shot back at which Taiga finally had enough and hit the other one against the shoulder.</p><p>“Could you finally cut it out!”</p><p>“Okay that’s enough both of you,” a third person was suddenly heard. Through all their fighting they hadn’t even realized that someone else had walked up to them. A look down to the village also showed that a lot of people were now curiously looking at them.</p><p>“Mitsu, would you please make him stop?” Taiga asked of the short man walking up to them with a calm expression.</p><p>“Would you stop behaving like the older brother?” Taisuke shot back, resulting in Taiga getting ready to jump at him, but while they had moved towards each other, they suddenly found themselves a few meters apart from each other. Nikaido gasped on the sudden movement he couldn’t explain. As if lifted by an invisible force they had ended up being thrown out of balance, but then placed back on their feet without harm.</p><p>“Good that I am the oldest brother and you two have to listen to me,” Hiromitsu said with a faint smile on which Taisuke rolled his eyes and Taiga pouted.</p><p>“Sorry for the rough greeting,” Hiromitsu finally addressed Nikaido this time. “I am sure you both had a tough journey up here. This place is not easy to find, but I guess the boy’s abilities have helped you to not lose your way.”</p><p>Nikaido felt a bit relieved about the normal conversation and it also didn’t seem like the other one would suddenly attack them. “If you want, we can take you in for a bit? I bet the boy needs a long rest after using his abilities for the waterfall and defending you against my stupid brother.”</p><p>A growl from Taisuke was heard on that comment, but he didn’t try to interfere this time.</p><p>“If it’s really okay then we would like to stay for a while, but just if we don’t have to fear any more sudden attacks,” Nikaido said looking at Taisuke who gave him a death glare in return.</p><p>“Don’t worry about him. He can be really suspicious about people, but he won’t do you any harm, you have my word.”</p><p>Still not completely trusting the situation, Nikaido lifted his brother up in his arms and nodded. “Then I would like to accept your offer and give my brother a good rest.”</p><p>“Oh great, more siblings in the village,” Taiga let out in excitement.</p><p>“If you want, I can make it easier for you,” Hiromitsu said as he lifted his arm and Nikaido felt how Kentaro got lighter in his arms, but he protectively kept a tight grip on him and shook his head.</p><p>“Thank you, but I will carry him myself.”</p><p>“As you wish,” Hiromitsu said before he turned and walked down to the village, followed by Taisuke who immediately started a discussion with him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he is really not as bad as he seems at first,” Taiga said as he stepped next to Nikaido. “By the way what’s your name?”</p><p>“I am Nikaido and this is my little brother Kentaro.”</p><p>“Welcome to our village then Nikaido,” Taiga said with a smile as they started walking down towards the village. “As you already heard through all the scolding, I am Taiga, I am the youngest of us three siblings,” Taiga explained as he pointed at the two men walking in front of them. “Taisuke is the middle brother and Hiromitsu the oldest one. Hiromitsu is also the leader of this village at least at the moment. But this might be too much explanation at once, so let’s get you somewhere to rest for now.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded gratefully, because he would definitely get a headache if he explained too much right away. When they arrived between the first huts Nikaido saw people whispering, pointing at them and some even trying to hide from them. There were families, children, young and old people, like a normal village they seemed to live here in the mountains, but Nikaido was already sure that they didn’t trust outsiders. While women couldn't become Phenomenists and seemed to live peacefully with everyone in the village it was definitely a different matter for strangers who were Infirms.</p><p>“Don’t take it personally, this village has quite a rough background with outsiders,” Taiga confirmed Nikaido’s worries. “Come over here, this is our doctor's house, he will have a quick look at Kentaro.”</p><p>Hiromitsu was waiting in front of the hut, but Taisuke had kept walking, now moving away from them. He turned around to Nikaido with another annoyed look before he entered the stone building in the middle of the village, disappearing out of his view.</p><p>“This is Miyata, our doctor,” Taiga introduced the man standing in the open door.</p><p>“Oh I see, we have someone who is still quite overwhelmed by his own abilities,” Miyata greeted them with a look at Kentaro’s condition. “Come in.”<br/>
Nikaido stepped inside the wooden hut, surprised to find quite some advanced equipment inside. It looked almost the same as the hospitals in the city, just a bit more chaotic as a few things were of course missing and others were improvised.</p><p>“We built the village ourselves, but we got what we needed from bigger towns down the mountain as they were all destroyed and abandoned anyways,” Hiromitsu explained.</p><p>“Put him here,” Miyata said as he pointed to a simple mattress on a wooden frame, a bit higher than a normal bed. Nikaido carefully put him down and stepped back as Miyata stepped closer.</p><p>Steps from another room made Nikaido turn and he spotted the two kids from before peeking inside the room.</p><p>“Kids, what did I tell you?” Miyata said scolding on which they vanished with a giggle. “Sorry, they are way too hyper to stay out of my treatment room even though I always tell them they are not allowed in here.”</p><p>Nikaido didn’t mind though after all it was thanks to them that they had found the village. “Are they your children?”</p><p>“Yes my daughter Hana, she is seven and my son Ken, he is five.”</p><p>Nikaido was sure that he would do a typical routine check up on Kentaro, but all he did was put his hand on the boy’s forehead and then silence followed.</p><p>A bit confused about the situation, Nikaido looked at Hiromitsu who gave him an understanding look. “Miyata can use power transfer to see with his own abilities if something isn’t okay with your brother.”</p><p>“Confusing, right?” Taiga said with a chuckle, because Nikaido’s expression told them that he was not getting at all what was going on. “Don’t worry we can explain everything in more detail if you want?”</p><p>“To be honest I would prefer the explanations later, for now I am happy if you can make sure he is fine, however that looks like.”</p><p>“You seem to be able to judge people very well,” Hiromitsu said on which Nikaido looked up at him. “It’s not easy to leave the treatment of your brother in a stranger's hands.”</p><p>“It’s the first time someone wants to help him after finding out he is a Phenomenist. Usually everyone tries to kill him.”</p><p>“Are you from one of the cities?” Taiga said curiously, to which Nikaido nodded.</p><p>“We lived in the eastern city since the end of the war, but a while ago Kentaro’s abilities suddenly surfaced and we couldn’t stay when he failed in hiding them.”</p><p>“You made a wise decision to run and did a good job in staying alive until now,” Hiromitsu praised him.</p><p>“It’s not like I did much, Kentaro was the one who could somehow sense you and find the way,” Nikaido said on which Hiromitsu shook his head.</p><p>“He needs you more than you might think,” the man said with a smile before Miyata finally walked up to them.</p><p>“He is completely fine, just pretty exhausted. A night of sleep will help him a lot.”</p><p>“Perfect, then let’s find you an empty hut,” Hiromitsu announced and looked at Taiga who got the message which Nikaido of course had no clue about and the boy excused himself, leaving the hut.</p><p>“When he wakes up make sure that he stays calm,” Miyata added on which Nikaido raised an eyebrow at him. “Do you know if he has any other abilities?”</p><p>Nikaido shook his head on that question. “I just saw him using water until now and he said he doesn’t know if he has any other abilities.”</p><p>“Then let’s be careful for now. When a Phenomenist is stressed, they might do things they regret later if they can’t control their abilities. If he can just use water then it won’t be a problem, because as long as you don’t put a bucket of water in front of his bed there won’t be anything he can use, but if he has other abilities, it could also be dangerous for you to be around when he wakes up.”</p><p>“I am staying with him no matter what.”</p><p>Hiromitsu had obviously seen that reply coming and nodded. “Well then let’s go.”</p><p>Nikaido thanked Miyata for his quick check up and lifted Kentaro up again, walking towards the door with Hiromitsu. When they stepped outside, Taiga was waiting for them, but he wasn’t alone. A man with dark red hair stood next to him and gave them a calm smile.</p><p>“Let me introduce you,” Hiromitsu said as he walked up to them. “This is Massu, one of our Phenomenists.”</p><p>“Nice to see a new face in a while,” Massu said with a bright smile. “Especially a calm water user that is always nicer than the hot headed Phenomenists,” Massu added on which Taiga hit him with his elbow.</p><p>“You are a fire user yourself idiot.”</p><p>“But I am not blowing up half the village,” Massu said with a wink on which Taiga laughed.</p><p>“Yeah, we leave that to Taisuke,” Taiga replied teasingly.</p><p>It wasn’t clear if they were joking or not, but Nikaido just started to dislike Taisuke even more after hearing that.</p><p>“So Massu will have an eye on you for the time being,” Hiromitsu said, to which Nikaido gave him a suspicious look. “I know, I am sorry about that, but you have to understand that we just need to be sure that we can trust you. I know that applies the other way around too, so don’t worry he won’t stay too close. He will just guard around the hut we will give you, making sure you stay safe and our people stay safe.”</p><p>As much as it seemed like a way too big security matter Nikaido couldn’t deny that they had all right to be suspicious about them and this was a way nicer treatment than they would get in the city.</p><p>After agreeing to everything, they got to one of the huts the furthest away from the center, also something Nikaido could understand. The hut was as all the others a simple one out of wood and the inside was just one big room. There was a fire place which made Nikaido feel relieved right away as the sun had already set and it was pretty cold here in the mountains. There was just one bed in the hut, but it was spacious enough for both of them and a chair was standing next to the fireplace as well as a table with two chairs they could use too.</p><p>“I know it’s not much, but please try and rest as well as you can,” Hiromitsu said before he and Taiga left.</p><p>“If anything is up, please make sure to let me know, I won’t bite you know?” Massu said with a smile and Nikaido thanked him before he went inside and put Kentaro carefully on the bed.</p><p>It seemed like Taiga had prepared the hut for them earlier as the fire was already lit and there was also some food and water put on the table.</p><p>“Let’s hope that my gut feeling is as good as yours,” Nikaido whispered as he sat down next to Kentaro and caressed his hair.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Kentaro woke up with a feeling of having slept a few days in a row. A bit disorientated he opened his eyes, facing a wooden wall. With a groan he tried to remember what had happened and then the image of the fire blast getting thrown towards them flashed through his mind and with a gasp he sat up. Even though he hadn’t done anything else but that, a shattering sound from inside the room made him flinch. Looking over to the table he saw a cup on the ground, water all over the floor.</p><p>Still too confused about what had happened after he had passed out, he looked next to him and felt immediate relief to find Nikaido next to him. His brother must have been too exhausted to even realize the noise as he didn’t seem to be disturbed in his sleep. The fact that he was sleeping this calmly made Kentaro hope that whatever had happened was a good outcome and wouldn’t bring them any more trouble.</p><p>Carefully he got up from the bed, not wanting to wake the other one up. The fireplace was still warm, but the fire seemed to have gone out a while ago. Now that it was daytime and the sunlight was already searching its way into the hut, he decided to leave it like this.</p><p>When he dared to look out of one of the windows, he could see the village they had arrived at the day before. People were already outside, some of them carrying grain so there were definitely fields around. Then he saw the two kids from the day before running around close to their hut, a woman yelling their names to make them follow her.</p><p>Curiously Kentaro went over to the door, before he turned to Nikaido once more. His brother needed the rest, but somehow Kentaro felt like he could leave him alone without fearing for any kind of trouble. His stomach feeling had brought them just positive results until now, so he hoped it would continue like that. Carefully Kentaro sneaked out the hut, closing the door as silent as possible.</p><p>“And where are we heading?”</p><p>On the sound of an unfamiliar voice Kentaro swirled around, unfortunately realizing too late that there had been stairs in front of him and with a squeal he fell to the front, already preparing for a hard landing on the ground. But the person in front of the hut had caught him on the arm at the last second, but released him the moment Kentaro found his balance.</p><p>“A small klutz, aren’t we?” Massu asked with a smile. “Did you have a good rest?”</p><p>On the question Kentaro nodded, but kept looking at the unknown man.</p><p>“Oh sorry, I guess Nikaido is still asleep and didn’t tell you anything yet?”</p><p>Once more Kentaro nodded and Massu stepped a bit back. “I’m Massu. For a while I will look out for you two if you want to call it that way.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you,” Kentaro said as politely as he could.</p><p>“I heard you were quite impressive standing up against Taisuke yesterday.”</p><p>He didn’t know the name, but he knew that it must have been the man who had attacked them and immediately his expression turned a bit darker.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he won’t attack you again,” Massu said, immediately trying to cheer him up.</p><p>“Don’t make promises my brother can’t keep,” Taiga was heard as he approached them. “You know Taisuke’s mood changes every few minutes.”</p><p>With a teasing smile he walked up to them, giving Kentaro a scanning look on which the boy looked a bit embarrassed to the ground. “I am Taiga, the little brother of the idiot who attacked you yesterday. Don’t worry he got a lot of scolding from our oldest brother already.”</p><p>“By the way, what are you doing here?” Massu finally asked on which Taiga pointed at Kentaro.</p><p>“I thought I could show him around a bit? You want to wake up your brother as well?”</p><p>“I actually would like to give him as much of a rest as he can get,” Kentaro said and Taiga nodded.</p><p>“Totally understandable, then let’s go?”</p><p>“Taiga, I don’t think this is a good idea.”</p><p>“No, you think that Taisuke won’t think of this as a good idea, but luckily he is not here, right?” Taiga teased.</p><p>A bit hesitant Kentaro walked after Taiga who had turned away from him without even looking if he was following him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Taiga is the best company you can have to make sure to not get into trouble,” Massu explained. “I will be here in case your brother wakes up.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Kentaro replied and hurried after Taiga.</p><p>“So where do you want to start?” Taiga asked as they walked around the village.</p><p>“Maybe by knowing where what is?” Kentaro asked and Taiga nodded.</p><p>“Well, that is easily explained luckily,” the boy explained as they walked up to the big stone building in the middle of the village. It looked pretty strong judging by the heavy stone walls and even the door seemed to be made out of iron instead of wood.</p><p>“This is the meeting hall. We use it for gatherings and also just to eat together sometimes. It’s also our shelter in case we get attacked. You see the bells all around?”</p><p>Kentaro nodded as he had seen Ken using them when they had arrived. One was right next to the meeting hall while others were scattered around the village even a bit outside of the center.</p><p>“We use them to warn the others in case there is an emergency. Everyone who is not part of our fighters has to come to the city hall immediately when someone rings the bell.”</p><p>“So outsiders like us cause a lot of uproar in your village, sorry about that,” Kentaro said.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that. We’re just trying to be ready in case someone from the city shows up and I don’t mean civilians. We have fighters to stand against them, but we still need to be careful.”</p><p>“When you say fighters, you mean the Phenomenists in your village?” Kentaro asked and before Taiga could reply there was an impact heard from the other side of the village on which Kentaro gave Taiga a worried look, but the latter just smiled.</p><p>“Perfect timing to explain this a bit easier,” Taiga said and waved at him. “Follow me.”</p><p>They passed a few more huts on their way, Kentaro trying to ignore the way he was stared at by most of the people.</p><p>“So over there are our fields by the way,” Taiga said as they left the last huts behind them and left the village to the opposite side from where Nikaido and Kentaro had come from the day before. There were rice fields along one side, which also explained the stream flowing down there. They had obviously built it to be able to water their fields.</p><p>“Down here just the fighters are allowed,” Taiga explained as they walked towards a rocky area right before the forest started again. As they kept walking around a small hillside another open space got visible, but it wasn’t at all the same as the village. It looked like a battlefield. Stones, more like huge rocks, were lying around as if they had been ripped out of the ground and tossed around. Cracks in the ground made it almost impossible to run without falling and still there were people in front of them fighting on exactly this destroyed ground.</p><p>“It’s our personal training ground. Here they can destroy what they want without risking to hurt someone, well except other fighters, but that is their own fault,” Taiga said with a chuckle. “We also have the stream from the village flow down here so water users can use their abilities as well, it also functions as a protection surrounding the village. But right now, you’re the only water user in the village.”</p><p>Kentaro saw the stream being just a few meters in front of them and going directly down to the training ground. Absentmindedly he kept staring at the people training. They were so concentrated that they hadn’t even noticed their presence yet. When a fire blast was shot through the air, he spotted Taisuke and his look immediately darkened.</p><p>“Don’t worry I know he overdid it at your first meeting, but as soon as he gets to know you better, he won’t be that aggressive anymore.”</p><p>“Better for him or I won’t just dodge next time,” Kentaro hissed on which Taiga gave him a stunt expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk like this about your brother. I wouldn’t want anyone to talk like this about mine either,” Kentaro apologized, making Taiga laugh to his surprise.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Taisuke gets scolded by Mitsu and me often enough he could use scolding from other people as well.”</p><p>Kentaro focused back on the people on the training ground, trying to figure out what abilities they had. He spotted a few younger boys as well between them, but while he could see how some of them lifted stones around them and even stopped people’s movements others weren’t using any abilities and kept attacking with their bare fists or weapons.</p><p>“Wataru and Aran are Infirms,” Taiga explained before Kentaro could even ask. “They are our best fighters without abilities. I train with them sometimes as well, but Mitsu is too much of an overprotective brother and he won’t let me participate in the training with the Phenomenists.”</p><p>“So you are an Infirm as well?” Kentaro asked a bit surprised even though the boy hadn’t shown him any sign of being a Phenomenist.</p><p>“I am. The only one of us three, but well I am still young so who knows maybe one day I will also have some ability?” It wasn’t obvious if he wanted to become like his brothers or if he preferred it to stay as he was, but Kentaro wouldn’t judge him for either. “Anyway, the reason why I am usually not training with them is actually Taisuke. He is even worse than Mitsu and super bad at control so as soon as something goes wrong at the training he usually freaks and because that brings the others in danger I am staying away from his training.”</p><p>“Sounds like a lot of trouble,” Kentaro said this time with a light smile on which Taiga chuckled.</p><p>“Trust me this village is full of trouble makers.”</p><p>“Who are the others?” Kentaro asked, pointing down at the fighters on which Taiga pointed at a dark brown haired boy who was throwing fire towards Wataru. Even though Wataru had no powers to defend himself he dodged the fire blasts quite well and got easily into the reach of the boy.</p><p>“That is Fuma. He is super explosive with his blasts and if they hit it will be the last attack you will get hit by, but-”</p><p>Before Taiga could explain more, Fuma stumbled to the back after getting kicked in the stomach by Wataru. The kick didn’t seem too bad and usually he could just form another blast now to get out of his reach, but then he fell on one knee, obviously exhausted.</p><p>“He has no control over his abilities, so while he can use an impressive amount of strength before fainting, he will easily overdo it,” Taiga explained. “The other two boys down there are Myuto and Ryosuke, both of them use telekinesis and Ryosuke can also use power transfer, Fuma as well by the way.”</p><p>“Okay I really think someone needs to explain all the ability stuff to me later, because I feel like I don’t even know what I can do or what others can do,” Kentaro explained a bit embarrassed on which Taiga patted his shoulder.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Without even knowing what had happened both boys turned towards the training ground and a fire blast was suddenly coming towards them. Taiga yelped and stumbled to the back while Kentaro stepped intuitively to the front and raised his hands. The fire blast was already past the stream, but that didn’t stop Kentaro and he found a way to make the water form a wave to catch up to the fire, burying it under it right before it could actually hit them. The result was that both of them ended up being swallowed by the wave as well and after the first moment of surprise Taiga started laughing. “Nice safe!”</p><p>“Are you okay?” Myuto asked as he ran towards them. “Sorry I didn’t notice you were watching and redirected Taisuke’s blast.”</p><p>“It’s okay, sorry we shouldn’t have come by without letting you know,” Taiga said, but before Kentaro could also say something Taisuke was up next to them as well.</p><p>“What the hell were you thinking?” Taisuke yelled at them the moment he walked up to them.</p><p>“Sorry I was showing Kentaro around and-”</p><p>“Where is Massu?” Taisuke interrupted him.</p><p>“Back at the house, Nikaido was still sleeping so-”</p><p>Without waiting for any more explanations Taisuke suddenly grabbed Kentaro by the arm and wanted to drag him away from the training ground. “This is no place for you and I don’t want you to walk around without guards.”</p><p>Kentaro didn’t even know what to reply and he wasn’t planning on causing an uproar so he just let himself get dragged along, but suddenly Taiga jumped in between them, slashing his brother’s hand away and standing in front of Kentaro.</p><p>“Why don’t you just go back to training and leave him alone?” Taiga hissed at his brother. “As you can see, we are totally fine without you. I was showing him around, no need to get angry at him.”</p><p>“Fine then I get angry at you,” Taisuke hissed back. “I forbid you to be around him or his brother without anyone else.”</p><p>Taiga couldn’t hide an ironic chuckle on that. “Yeah right, because Kentaro is so damn dangerous. It was your fire blast that almost hit me right now, but Kentaro’s water which protected me, just so you know.”</p><p>“Guys could we just calm down a bit?” Myuto asked carefully on which he got hit by two death glares at once. “Well I was just suggesting…”</p><p>Without testing his luck too much Myuto retreated a bit and the other fighters also looked up to them, but looked more annoyed instead of wanting to interfere. It seemed like this sibling fight wasn’t something new for them.</p><p>“Anyways, you get back now!” Taisuke said and shoved Taiga out of the way to pull Kentaro away from the training ground. This time though he seemed so annoyed already that he actually hurt him with his tight grip and Kentaro let out a hiss, automatically trying to pull his wrist out of the other one’s grip.</p><p>“Stop struggling and keep moving,” Taisuke shouted, tightening his grip, but suddenly something changed and Kentaro felt a weird pain shooting up his arm to his chest and with a gasp he put his free hand up to his chest.</p><p>“Hands off my brother!”</p><p>The shouting came from the entrance of the training ground where Nikaido stormed down to them, followed by Massu. Taisuke rolled his eyes in annoyance not even realizing Kentaro’s condition as he let go of him and turned to Nikaido.</p><p>“What do you-”</p><p>He couldn’t end his sentence as Nikaido hit him straight in the face the moment he reached him on which Massu finally dashed towards them as well, already in between them before Taisuke could even think about freaking out, but the fire was already visible around his fists.</p><p>“Okay, time out, both of you!” Massu scolded them both.</p><p>“Hey, Kentaro, are you okay?” Taiga asked worriedly as the boy kept breathing heavily and leant to the front, his hand still clenched into his shirt over his chest.</p><p>“What did you do to him?” Nikaido shouted at Taisuke as he walked up to Kentaro and took a closer look at him. Kentaro reached out for him immediately, pulling himself into a hug as if this could somehow stop the weird pain.</p><p>“I’m sorry. Taiga was just showing me around,” Kentaro replied, out of breath as if he had been training with the others.</p><p>“We can discuss that later, what did happen that you are in pain?”</p><p>“I don’t know, everything was fine and then suddenly the pain shot through my arm to my chest.”</p><p>“Wait, let me see,” Massu said and Nikaido made space for him so he could have a closer look at him before he turned towards Taisuke instead. The latter wasn’t pleased by Massu’s scanning look and even less happy about the annoyed tongue clicking he let out seconds later.</p><p>“What?” Taisuke growled.</p><p>“Do you feel by any way totally refreshed as if you haven’t even trained right now?”</p><p>“What, why would I-” Taisuke started, but then he gasped, realizing that he was right and then he looked over to Kentaro. It was the first time they saw an apologizing look on his face.</p><p>“As I thought,” Massu said before he looked down at the other fighters. “Ryosuke, can you come up here for a moment?”</p><p>The boy in question came running immediately. A boy just a bit older than Kentaro and Taiga, gray eyes and light brown hair. A silver earring on his left ear was making him look like a person hard to approach, but his honest smile made that first impression change.</p><p>“So, as it seems, Taisuke has stolen some power from Kentaro,” Massu explained.</p><p>“Not on purpose though,” Taisuke added on which he got a glare from his little brother.</p><p>“Anyway, would you mind restoring it?” Massu continued.</p><p>“Sure, no problem,” the boy said, but when he stepped closer, Kentaro pulled himself back against Nikaido’s chest and his older brother looked a bit nervous at everyone around.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Ryosuke is the best when it comes to power transfer, he will make the pain stop,” Massu soothed them and Kentaro looked over his shoulder at Ryosuke who waited patiently for the boy to come to him. A bit hesitantly Kentaro finally stepped away from his brother and stretched his arm out to Ryosuke.</p><p>“The pain will be gone in no time, don’t worry,” Ryosuke promised and closed both of his hands around Kentaro’s hand and then without anything actually happening the pain was gone.</p><p>“Here you go,” Ryosuke said with a smile and stepped back as Nikaido took a closer look at his brother who didn’t seem to be in pain at all from one second to the other.</p><p>“Wow, that is a convenient ability,” Kentaro said.</p><p>“And a dangerous one when not used wisely,” Taiga added with a side glance to his brother on which Massu clapped his hands.</p><p>“Okay great so everything is finally back to normal. Taisuke, you go back to training, Taiga you come with us. No discussions!”</p><p>Luckily everyone seemed to respect Massu enough to really not discuss this any further and Nikaido didn’t even feel the need to apologize as he looked up at Taisuke, seeing how he would definitely carry a bruise on his cheekbone from his punch.</p><p>“He didn’t do it on purpose, let’s just leave,” Kentaro said as he realized his brother’s rising tension and luckily Nikaido turned without any mocking comment.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>This time Kentaro felt even worse than the other times he had collapsed and a heavy headache made him groan and keep his eyes closed.</p><p>“Finally awake?”</p><p>On the sound of his brother’s voice Kentaro finally opened his eyes, finding himself in their hut and it was bright daylight outside so he had at least slept since the afternoon the day before.</p><p>“Please tell me that you didn’t get angry at Taisuke?”</p><p>Nikaido couldn’t hide a chuckle on that question and shook his head. “This is the first thing you worry about?”</p><p>“Well, I provoked him on purpose so it wouldn’t be fair to get angry at him.”</p><p>“Yeah, I heard everything from Hiromitsu, but please promise me to not be so reckless with your abilities from now on. I know you want to prove that you can keep up with them, but remember that your own ability could cause you harm as well.”</p><p>Kentaro felt embarrassed for causing trouble again while all he wanted was proving that he was in control of his ability, which reminded him that he wasn’t, because he couldn’t even remember how he had ended up with that shield of water around him. With an analyzing look he touched his own skin, but nothing seemed to have changed.</p><p>“I heard you used a technique Hiromitsu hasn’t seen until now,” Nikaido said with a proud undertone.</p><p>“I guess I did. I am not sure how though. It just felt right to do, well, nothing? And let the water do the rest? That sounds stupid, right?”</p><p>Nikaido shook his head when he got up and walked over to the fireplace to put in more wood as it was a pretty cold day now that the winter time was rushing towards their mountain.</p><p>“For an Infirm I guess it sounds weird indeed, but I know that you wouldn’t risk your life for some stupid training so I guess your ability might guide you more than you guide it?”</p><p>That was indeed a good explanation, because it was always like the water was telling him what he could do and not the other way around.</p><p>“For now, rest a bit more and let’s get dinner in the meeting hall later if you feel well enough? Wataru came by earlier telling me that they had a meeting with a small dinner together in the evening.”</p><p>That was some distraction he could definitely need and getting food sounded amazing to his empty stomach as well.</p><p>***</p><p>The meeting hall seemed like a building of the city instead of this village. Before the war they were all modern like this, but with limited sources it was understandable that they couldn’t actually build a whole village with heavy metal doors and strong stone walls.</p><p>The hall itself was just one big room with wooden tables and chairs spread over the place. In the front was a podium which was usually used when they were having meetings, but for now Nikaido and Kentaro hadn’t been part of any which was understandable after all they were still strangers to most of them.</p><p>Miyata greeted them on the way in and asked Kentaro how he was feeling. His impatient kids cut the conversation short as he was dragged away by them so they could finally eat.</p><p>“This reminds me of the camp side we used to go to,” Nikaido said with a faint smile.</p><p>“I remember bits and pieces of that time,” Kentaro replied. He had been too young to remember much from the peaceful times before the war and his memories of places and faces was only faint.</p><p>“Oh you came, great,” Hiromitsu greeted them.</p><p>“Thank you for inviting us,” Nikaido replied and followed Hiromitsu through the room as he walked towards a table where Wataru and Massu were sitting, but stopped before sitting down.</p><p>Kentaro wasn’t even surprised when Taiga showed up next to him and hooked his elbow into his. “Want to sit with us?”</p><p>Nikaido lifted an eyebrow at the sudden invitation which was obviously just meant for his little brother, but he realized soon that Hiromitsu nodded gratefully at Taiga.</p><p>“Nikaido, why don’t you join us and let the younger ones have some playtime?” Hiromitsu offered.</p><p>“We’re not that young,” Taiga complained, but dragged Kentaro after him anyway. “Here, sit down.”</p><p>Kentaro did as he was told as he was shoved on a bench next to Fuma and Taiga sat down on his other side. Opposite him Myuto and Aran were sitting, but they were eating in silence for now. Looking over his shoulder Kentaro spotted his brother having a talk with the village leader and the other older ones instead of having dinner first. He couldn’t hear them over the talking of all the people in the room, but he didn’t miss the short glances over to their table from time to time.</p><p>“Don’t bother, they always talk about the complicated things,” Fuma explained before he shoved a way too big bread in his mouth resulting in him coughing a few times before he was able to swallow it.</p><p>“I just wonder why my brother was called over for it?”</p><p>“To be honest I think it has something to do with the patrols,” Taiga explained, on which Taiga tilted his head in confusion. “Do you realize that some people are missing? Or were missing over some part of the day?”</p><p>Now that he took a look around he indeed realized that he couldn’t spot Ryosuke or Taisuke, as well as some of their other fighters he had met before.</p><p>“We usually send out people to patrol around our borders. Not every entrance to the village is blocked by something like the waterfall you came through,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“So not only Phenomenists are going on patrol?”</p><p>“There has to be at least one in the group, yes. We usually form groups of two or three members. For tonight Ryosuke and Taisuke are out with other fighters. There are quite a few points we have to check, but we cannot let every Phenomenist leave the village for such a long time, so we have to take the risk and leave some points open.”</p><p>“Sounds logical,” Kentaro said nodding.</p><p>“I am going tomorrow morning, maybe you can ask if you can join?” Fuma said. “I am with Massu so there is another spot open if you want to join?”</p><p>A disapproving hum came from the other side of the table and all eyes were on Aran. The boy didn’t even seem to feel caught and kept looking at Kentaro with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“Any complaints?” Fuma asked dangerously.</p><p>“Oh no of course not. Let a Phenomenist we don’t know anything about patrol our borders. Don’t be surprised though if he vanishes after seeing them all so that he can report back to the city.”</p><p>“And now he comes with his <a href="https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">conspiracy</a> theory again,” Fuma said and couldn’t from forming a mocking smile.</p><p>“Stop making fun of him,” Taiga interfered warningly. “Aran, we know you had a lot of trouble with Phenomenists before, but we didn’t judge you either when you came to us.”</p><p>Aran didn’t seem in any way getting calmer through that statement and he crossed his arms to his chest with a pouting expression.</p><p>“I don’t want to make things even worse, but can I ask something?” Kentaro dared to ask.</p><p>“Sure, what is it?” Taiga asked as open as always.</p><p>“Why would I as a Phenomenist report to any city?”</p><p>It was a valid question, because Phenomenists weren’t allowed in any city, but Aran had just made it sound like he was of the bad kind and with the people actually hunting them down.</p><p>“Why would I leave the city?” Aran asked back.</p><p>A moment of silence followed his question as Kentaro wasn’t sure if that was a rhetorical question or not.</p><p>“Aran thinks there are Phenomenists in the city teaming up with Infirms to get rid of those who don’t want to corporate,” Myuto finally spilled.</p><p>“I don’t think that I know it. I’ve seen them and exactly that is why I had to get away.”</p><p>“Teaming up with the enemy,” Kentaro let out in a low voice on which Aran seemed ready to explode, but Kentaro wasn’t actually making fun of him. “Doesn’t sound impossible.”</p><p>“Oh god, not you too,” Fuma said, rolling his eyes. “It’s enough when we have one idiot coming up with all those stories.”</p><p>It happened before anyone could react. Kentaro gasped, but Fuma didn’t even move.</p><p>The water which had stopped midair came out of Aran’s cup. Angry about getting made fun of all the time he had emptied it towards Fuma, but it hadn’t been Fuma using his ability as he could only use fire and power transfer.</p><p>“Oh no, did Myuto ruin all the fun for you?” Fuma teased, resulting in Aran slamming the cup back on the table, making some people turn towards them.</p><p>“One day you will all pay for not believing me,” Aran hissed before he stormed out of the meeting hall.</p><p>“Well, so much for a calm dinner,” Myuto said as he used the cup to catch the midair hanging water. When he got up no one stopped him or asked where he was going, but all Kentaro could do was staring forth and back between Fuma and Taiga in confusion.</p><p>“Okay, so do I get to know what is going on?”</p><p>“Never seen a quarrel before?” Fuma asked while he kept eating as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Okay I might not know any of you that well, but this was completely awkward. You do believe him, don’t you?”</p><p>“Fast in catching up as always,” Taiga said with a smile. “Yes, we do, but it’s not like he has any names or locations. There are too many things he is just overly suspicious about. He said he has seen someone who got caught as a Phenomenist suddenly showing up with the soldiers one day. But he could never confirm that it was indeed the same person or if he was using any abilities.”</p><p>“And there is nothing we can do about it. He ran from the city, feeling trapped, but it’s not like we would easily go there to investigate,” Fuma added.</p><p>So there was indeed more to the story than just some friends teasing him about something which was actually quite logical.</p><p>“But he has Myuto to take care of him, so no worries,” Fuma added and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“But didn’t you say those two were troublemakers?”</p><p>“They are, but not towards each other,” Taiga said with a teasing smile, making Kentaro refrain from more questions.</p><p>***</p><p>Nikaido looked a bit worried over to the younger boys after Aran had stormed out the building followed by Myuto.</p><p>“Don’t mind them, that happens a lot,” Wataru soothed him.</p><p>“Back to the topic, what do you think?” Hiromitsu asked. The moment Hiromitsu had asked him if it was okay for him to send Kentaro out on a patrol his appetite had vanished.</p><p>“I don’t know. His ability is not that reliable yet, is it?”</p><p>“Well, it is pretty strong when he needs to protect himself or someone else, so as long as we don’t team him up with someone, he wouldn’t want to protect he should be completely fine,” Hiromitsu explained.</p><p>“And we would make sure to send at least two people with him at first and give him short patrols at daytime,” Massu added.</p><p>“Can’t I go with him?” Nikaido asked, but Wataru shook his head.</p><p>“We have a rule about family members not being allowed to go together, it’s just, you know, always a bit difficult with the judgment when you go with someone you care about too much.”</p><p>“We also watch out not to send out people together who have a too strong bond or can’t judge the situation right anymore if they are with a close friend,” Hiromitsu added.</p><p>“But someone like Taisuke seems to get emotional no matter who he is with? Aren’t you his best friend?” Nikaido asked after he had seen Taisuke with Wataru on a patrol before.</p><p>“Well, Taisuke is a special case, but most of the older ones were trained by the founders, so usually we’re all pretty good in judging the situation no matter who is with us.”</p><p>“The founders?” Nikaido asked.</p><p>“The village founders,” Massu explained. “They left the village in Hiromitsu’s care and traveled northwards about two years ago.”</p><p>“But there is nothing left northwards.”</p><p>“There are other Phenomenists,” Wataru said. “They try to find as many of them as possible. They created small communities to leave them with other leaders in the near future.”</p><p>Nikaido slowly nodded, but everyone was still looking at him and he finally let out a sigh. “Fine, he can patrol as soon as you think he is ready.”</p><p>Hiromitsu didn’t even ask what made him agree. Kentaro was fighting with Fuma over the last bread, while Taiga was laughing at them and cheering for Kentaro. It was definitely a bittersweet memory for Nikaido to see his little brother that lively.</p><p>“Great, I will make sure he stays safe,” Hiromitsu said.</p><p>“I have one condition though,” Nikaido said, making all three look at him. “You said he shouldn’t go with someone he didn’t want to protect.”</p><p>Hiromitsu understood immediately and nodded. “No worries I will make sure he is with the best people.”</p><p>“There is actually a second request we have,” Wataru suddenly said. Why didn’t he like the way they exchanged nervous looks on exactly that request? It was already the second time he felt like this and he feared that it would end the same way as before.</p><p>***</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Taisuke growled as they all met the next morning in the meeting hall to announce the new teams and he wasn’t the only one not happy about his team.</p><p>“Don’t think I am happy about this,” Nikaido replied with crossed arms to his chest.</p><p>“Then say you won’t go! Why are you and your brother part of the teams in the first place?” When Taisuke kept throwing his arms around as if he wanted to actually rip down the whole building, Hiromitsu stepped in between them. After all, Taisuke was known for a bad ability control so he could actually damage something or someone.</p><p>“This is a decision that has nothing to do with you, remember you were the one who said you don’t want any responsibility for the village, that is why you are not part of the council.”</p><p>Hiromitsu, Massu and Wataru were usually taking on the part of the council, while Taisuke had immediately said when they had formed it that he didn’t want to be part of it.</p><p>Taisuke pouted on all the scolding and crossed his arms to his chest making it hard for Taiga and Kentaro who were standing a bit in the back to not laugh at their older brothers as they looked exactly the same now. Both pissed and both behaving like children.</p><p>“And you are also okay with going out on patrol?” Taiga whispered towards Kentaro while Hiromitsu continued his scolding. Kentaro nodded, but couldn’t hide a nervous expression.</p><p>“If there is anything I can do for the village I want to try, even though I feel like I will be more of a burden at first.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, you have at least an ability, people usually complain when they have me on the team,” Taiga laughed off his weakness of fighting. “Not that I go often on patrols in the first place.”</p><p>“Okay everyone, listen up,” Hiromitsu finally said and everyone who was gathered stepped closer to the board in front where all their names and regions of the patrols were written down.</p><p>“We have two new members on our patrol teams, Nikaido and Kentaro,” Hiromitsu announced, but except for Taisuke no one seemed really annoyed by that announcement.</p><p>“So, to make it easier for them I will go through the basic explanation once more,” Hiromitsu said and gave Taisuke a warning look the moment he rolled his eyes. “We have three directions for patrols. Not more than three teams are allowed to go out at the same time so that we have enough people left at the village to protect it. The route itself can be chosen by the team. We have checkpoints like the waterfall which always need to be passed, but other than that the area around the district can be patrolled without a particular route, which is also to make sure that in the case someone spots someone on patrol they won’t be able to sneak around us because we are patrolling the same path every day.”</p><p>It made a lot of sense to Kentaro and he really wanted to know how the area around the village looked like. Until now he just knew the thick forest to the south.</p><p>“The most dangerous region to go is southwards, because the Eastern city is closest there. In the north there are no other cities left, so the north route is a spacious area, but usually the calmest. To the west the mountains aren’t as high and sometimes patrols from the city try to make their way northwards from there, so on that route you also have to watch out.”</p><p>Nikaido listened closely to everything, because no matter with whom he’d be out on patrol he would need to make sure he and the other people would stay safe.</p><p>“The team for the south will be Myuto, Massu and Fuma.”</p><p>“I get the chaos troop today,” Massu said with a sigh on which Fuma patted his back. “It’s okay I will make sure Myuto won’t be too annoying.”</p><p>Massu hit him on the back of his head on which Fuma pouted. “I am talking about you, idiot!”</p><p>Myuto couldn’t hide a chuckle, but Kentaro also didn’t necessarily want those two in his team for his first patrol.</p><p>“The north is going to Ryosuke, Kentaro and myself,” Hiromitsu announced. As it was already written on the board, they weren’t surprised, but earlier Taiga had explained that it was rare for Hiromitsu to leave the village in Wataru’s care, but because it was Kentaro’s first patrol he was obviously trying to make sure he’d be safe. After all, Ryosuke was one of their best Phenomenists and yet he joined as well.</p><p>“For the west route Nikaido and Taisuke will go.”</p><p>“Can’t you put someone else in the team? Even Aran would be fine,” Taisuke complained and Kentaro was sure that the ‘even Aran’ part would have made the boy freak, but luckily he wasn’t present. It was clear though that Myuto also didn’t like the way Taisuke talked about him and other Infirm most of the time, even though he was such good friends with Wataru.</p><p>“It’s enough if you get on the nerves of one person, trust me,” Wataru was the one to interfere. “Remember that the priority of any patrol is to come back safely. You don’t have to take any risks. All you need to do if you see soldiers from the city is to report back. If a fight is unpreventable make sure to protect each other.”</p><p>“As if he could even protect himself,” Taisuke growled, making Nikaido roll his eyes, but bit back a mocking comment about Taisuke’s bad ability control.</p><p>“Then off you go, be back before the sun reaches the peak of the mountain,” Hiromitsu warned them before they all got their bags with some proviant for the day.</p><p>“Be careful,” Nikaido said to his little brother and patted his shoulder. Kentaro gave him a faint smile and nodded.</p><p>“You too, and don’t rip each other apart,” Kentaro teased. Nikaido cracked a smile before he walked after Taisuke who was of course ready to leave without him if he didn’t hurry.</p><p>***</p><p>“Could you stop making this a competition?” Nikaido growled. Taisuke stopped so abruptly that Nikaido almost bumped into him.</p><p>“A competition? Against who, you?” Taisuke asked with a smirk. “You are an Infirm and not even good at fighting, there is no way you could ever compete against me.”</p><p>Nikaido rolled his eyes on that statement, but what else did he expect? “Whatever, just stop hurrying that much. I don’t think we need to dash through the forest like this, do we?”</p><p>They obviously didn’t have to, but Taisuke wanted to get over with their patrol as fast as possible. Without giving a reply Taisuke kept moving, but this time he finally started walking slower which made it easier for Nikaido to keep up with him. After all he didn’t know the surroundings and needed to watch out where to step to not stumble.</p><p>After a few more minutes in silence, they had reached a steep hillside with a pretty fast flowing river, meters under them.</p><p>“This is where we usually turn around,” Taisuke said, sounding pretty happy about half of the patrol being over. “There is no way to the other side, so all we do is check a bit up and down the river if anyone tried to somehow get over, but to be honest it’s almost impossible.”</p><p>“Well almost is still a good reason to check,” Nikaido said and he didn’t miss Taisuke’s annoyed look before he started moving alongside the river.</p><p>“Does each patrol route have something like this river or the waterfall we came though?” Nikaido asked as the silence started annoying him. It wasn’t like he liked small talk, especially with Taisuke, but there was also no reason to keep this moody atmosphere between them.</p><p>“It’s not like our village is inaccessible from all directions, that’s why we have patrols. You would have known that if you listened to Hiromitsu in the morning,” Taisuke started an almost normal conversation for once in a while with just a bit of cynic behavior. “We have our turn around spots, but especially from the south it’s always possible that some troops from the city could make it through the mountains without us noticing that’s why the south patrol is the most important one, towards the east side the cliff of the waterfall unfolds to a depth that it is impossible to access the village from the east, that is why don’t patrol much over there.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded on hearing that, because it made sense. Nikaido and Kentaro had made it through a part usually not taken by Infirm, so they wouldn’t check it as much as easier accessible paths.</p><p>“Did anyone from the city ever make it to your village? I mean those who didn’t seek shelter.”</p><p>The way Taisuke’s look darkened showed that he had understood the question the right way.</p><p>“There were, a long time ago,” Taisuke said, then he fell silent.</p><p>Nikaido knew this was already more information than Taisuke would usually give price towards an outsider. There was no meaning in trying to make him talk about it if he didn’t trust him. A few more minutes they walked in silence next to the river until Taisuke stopped.</p><p>“I guess we can head back towards the village from here.”</p><p>Nikaido nodded, already turning around, but when he realized that Taisuke wasn’t following him he waited. The older one was facing the river, his hands slightly clenched to fists.</p><p>“I want to make this clear,” he suddenly started, but didn’t turn around. “I don’t hate you or your brother. I have no personal grudge against any of you. But I trusted someone before and in the end I got betrayed, that leaves a lot of scars.”</p><p>There was nothing Nikaido could reply. It had been the most honest thing Taisuke had told him so far. It made him feel somehow relieved to see that he can actually show a weak side as well.</p><p>***</p><p>“Don’t be so concentrated all the time,” Ryosuke said and patted Kentaro’s shoulder on which he slightly flinched. “Look, you are way too tense for a patrol.”</p><p>“But aren’t we supposed to watch out for attacks and people sneaking around?”</p><p>Ryosuke couldn’t hide his laughter when Hiromitsu turned towards them, but then just kept moving with a smile.</p><p>“First, we have the northern route so not much to worry about, second even if someone is around, Hiromitsu would notice that before you could even decide if it’s a friend or foe.”</p><p>Ryosuke sounded pretty convinced by his own words, but no matter how awesome all their abilities were he still feared that if they didn’t watch out it could be a fatal mistake sooner or later.</p><p>“Okay, here let me distract you,” Ryosuke said and took his arm without a warning.</p><p>“Hey,” Kentaro said and ripped his arm out of his grip. “Why would you steal my abilities on a patrol?”</p><p>“Oh, you realized that fast,” Ryosuke said impressed. “I didn’t even have the time to get much of them.”</p><p>Kentaro kept pouting for a few more steps until they reached a part where they had to climb up a small stone area. Hiromitsu was waiting on top of it already and when Kentaro made it to the top without problems he finally raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, seems like someone learned a bit more about Power transfer?” Hiromitsu asked as Kentaro looked confused at his own hands.</p><p>“Why am I not feeling exhausted? The last time Taisuke accidently took my abilities I felt like collapsing.”</p><p>“That’s because Taisuke’s power transfer sucks and mine doesn’t,” Ryosuke said, Hiromitsu hitting him on the back of the head.</p><p>“You just learn quicker than him and now keep a look around, would you?”</p><p>Ryosuke hurried to the front of their group while Hiromitsu stayed with Kentaro this time.</p><p>“Taisuke can’t control his abilities well, so when he uses his power transfer it’s usually connected to his emotions which drags along the energy of the person together with the ability.</p><p>“But wait, does that mean you can drag actual life energy out of a human? Is that working with Infirm as well?”</p><p>It didn’t seem like Hiromitsu had heard this question for the first time, but he also didn’t seem to like answering it.</p><p>“You know when we train, we try not to hurt each other, but especially because we have Infirm training with us, accidents happen and sometimes they actually help us to learn more about our abilities.”</p><p>“So, you can actually draw energy from an Infirm, not just abilities from Phenomenists?” Kentaro asked directly this time and Hiromitsu had no other choice, but to nod.</p><p>“Yes, it is possible. It was Taisuke who did it by accident, but only Phenomenists with good power transfer control can actually divide if they want to draw energy or an ability.”</p><p>“So maybe it’s difficult for fire users, because they are hot headed?” Kentaro asked with a small smile on which Hiromitsu chuckled.</p><p>“That could be actually true,” Hiromitsu said.</p><p>Kentaro suddenly stopped as he got distracted and he tried to put a finger on what he was sensing. Why was he sensing something in the first place? Maybe it was a side effect through Ryosuke taking some of his abilities? Even when he stopped walking, Hiromitsu didn’t even seem to realize that something was wrong or was there even something wrong? Something made him turn his attention towards the western side of the patrol area.</p><p>“Kentaro, all good?” Ryosuke asked from the front on which Hiromitsu also finally stopped and turned.</p><p>There was no time to reply, because the ground was suddenly shaking and they all gasped as they saw half a mountainside collapse towards the west.</p><p>“What the hell?” Ryosuke asked in shock while Hiromitsu was already walking back towards Kentaro, but the boy wasn’t waiting for him. This was definitely no coincidence as the collapsed mountainside was on Nikaido and Taisuke’s patrol path.</p>
