<p>Anything more and Taiga was going to swoon. He hadn’t even been briefed yet but he already knew this new job, this new <i>home</i> were both absolutely perfect.</p><p>Expected working hours? Reasonable. Free time? Loads of it. The premises? Not quite as vampire-y as he had imagined it would be, but still luxurious and furnished with a fashionable eye. Employer? Hot as fuck.</p><p>Pulling his huge suitcase, he followed upstairs after Jesse, the tallest of the three vampires. He couldn’t believe his luck; that Jesse had actually chosen <i>him</i> from the three applicants, when the guy called Hokuto looked so clever, and the guy named Juri was such a smooth talker.</p><p>Taiga wasn’t quite sure which of his virtues Jesse had appreciated so much. It sure as hell wasn’t his housekeeping skills, and he hoped it wasn’t the delicate physical features inherited from his parents. Sure, it was nice to have a tolerable face, but he’d rather be liked for reasons he had actually worked for.</p><p>He should ask Jesse about it. Maybe.</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>“Which room is your coffin in?” Taiga asked; a feeble attempt of small talk. Jesse glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>“My coffin,” he repeated, an amused twinkle in his eyes. “Why would I sleep in a coffin, when I was never buried? Here,” he said and opened the first door on the left. He didn’t enter the room however, so Taiga only took a peek in from the doorstep too. By the wall there was a wide and comfortable-looking, yet disappointingly ordinary bed. At least the sheets looked like they might be wine red silk. Little solaces.</p><p>“Your room is here,” Jesse said and moved on to the next door. They stepped into a room that was notably plain in style, but it was bright and felt spacious despite being slightly smaller than Jesse's room. There was a bed with shining white sheets, a desk, an empty bookshelf, and something that Taiga suspected was a walk-in closet since he didn’t see a wardrobe in the room. And of course, there was the door that connected his room to Jesse’s.</p><p>“Please don’t mind the simplicity of the room. We didn’t want to make any decisions about the room decors on your behalves. Just tell me what you need to make yourself comfortable in here, and I will arrange it. Furniture, textiles, anything.”</p><p>Taiga nodded, walking to the window and running his fingers along the wide windowsill. The view to the city was already beautiful in the warm afternoon light, and he supposed it would be absolutely exquisite at night.</p><p>“I guess I could do with blackout curtains,” he said thoughtfully and threw a small smile at Jesse. “I understand it’s my room but you should feel comfortable in here, too.”</p><p>Jesse raised a brow. “Do I look uncomfortable now?”</p><p>He simply stood there, leaning against the door frame with his arms loosely crossed on his chest, face twisted with badly suppressed laughter. Taiga frowned, feeling oddly disappointed again. Now that he thought about it, Jesse's room hadn't been dark, either. Sure, there had been heavy curtains hanging by the windows, but they had been pulled to the sides.</p><p>When he didn’t answer, Jesse chuckled and stepped in front of him, a little too close for it to be casual, gently brushing the back of Taiga’s hand with his fingertips.</p><p>“Thank you for being so considerate,” he said softly.</p><p>Taiga inhaled sharply and felt his skin raise on goose bumps, but before he could react in any way, Jesse was back at the door and grinned again.</p><p>“Maybe don’t believe everything you read in a manga or see in a movie. I’ll leave you to settle down in peace. See you at the dining room in half an hour for the briefing,” he said and was gone.</p><p>Mildly annoyed for getting laughed at, Taiga slumped down to sit at the foot end of his bed. Yet, it took several minutes for his heartbeat to calm down.</p>
