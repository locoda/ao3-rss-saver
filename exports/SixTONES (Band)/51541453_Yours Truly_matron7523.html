<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Matsumura dropped by the show today," someone mentions, and Taiga's ears perk up at the name.</p><p>"Hokuto?" he inquires, turning to his co-stars, who are gathered for their final greetings.</p><p>"He's still around," the conductor explains. "I guided him to wait in your dressing room, Kyomoto. I thought that perhaps you'd like to say quickly hello to your friend and thank him for coming today."
</p><p>When put like that, it manages to sound awkward.</p><p>Somehow, usually, all references to his and Hokuto's interactions manage to sound more or less awkward. Luckily, Jesse isn't present because he'd suggest Taiga finally exchange contact information with Hokuto. Maybe advise them not to always be silent but to talk about something. Although Jesse usually does that kind of commenting only when cameras are rolling nowadays, it's still a forever mystery why everyone, including their fans, finds Taiga and Hokuto's clumsy interaction so entertaining and gets some weird delight from witnessing it.</p><p>"Taiga, want to join us for dinner tonight?" Watabe asks.</p><p>"Sorry, I have... other plans reserved already," Taiga replies vaguely and excuses himself.</p><p>Thankfully, his co-stars aren't the nosy kind. They just give a shrug and wish him a good evening. It's more like standard advice in the industry not to pry and dig too much into each other's business.</p><p>*****</p><p>"You always show up out of the blue. I'm starting to think you've been a ninja in your previous life," Taiga remarks as he enters through the curtain to his dressing room and spots Hokuto there.</p><p>"Ooh, it's Guy - what brings you to Japan from France? Almost thought it was Kyomoto, but the face doesn't quite match."</p><p>Taiga lets out a dismissive sound, still dressed in his costume and makeup. He tried to get some tan for this role, but it didn't quite work out, and now he's stuck with a foundation that's a shade too dark.</p><p>Naturally, Hokuto notices every detail with his observant eye. It's like he watches everyone so closely that he never misses a thing, always managing to pinpoint just the right topics to bring up. What makes it even more interesting is that he does all this without saying much, sometimes looking like he's lost in thought and just spacing out. It's always surprising when he finally shares the things he's quietly noticed.</p><p>"And you know," Hokuto continues, "Unlike you, I'm at least revealing myself in the end. I'm not watching your musicals in disguise."</p><p>Hokuto watches him with amusement, referring to his ongoing banter about Taiga secretly watching his dramas. Taiga sometimes regrets some of his life choices, but he especially regrets the whole conversation that led to this revelation, as Hokuto continues to bring it up tirelessly again and again.</p><p>"How was today's show then?" Taiga asks.</p><p>A small smile curves on one side of Hokuto's mouth.</p><p>"Oh, it was impressive, fantastic, wonderful," he responds. "The person in the lead role, wow. He just absolutely nailed the singing, and there was this aura of suffering around him all the time—powerful stuff. But hey, maybe a bit of a note for next time, perhaps he should ease up on the part where he keeps hitting himself? I mean, honestly, I was genuinely concerned about what if he ended up hurting himself for real. The commitment is commendable, but there's still a fine line."</p><p>"Look who's talking," Taiga shakes his head, remembering all the stuff Hokuto has done for his roles. "If you're not overdoing your roles and putting yourself in potential danger, you're at least making sure to skip meals for work."</p><p>Hokuto ignores him but keeps going with his rambling. "No, but seriously, the person who played the lead role, oh man, he was really really good. Seriously impressive. I'm thinking, you know, I wish I could meet him someday, maybe grab a coffee or something. Happen to know him, Guy?"</p><p>"I should kick you out for showing up just to make fun of me. Is this your routine even when you attend other members' stage plays?" Taiga sighs as he removes his jacket and places it on the hanger on the coat rack.</p><p>Hokuto's expression turns a bit more serious. "I was complimenting you, not mocking. I'm serious when I tell you did an excellent job today, Kyomoto."</p><p>Taiga can't suppress a small smile because such a compliment coming from Hokuto does feel nice. However, he's not the best at reacting to compliments from anyone, so instead of saying anything to that, he simply turns towards the mirror.</p><p>As Taiga starts to remove his makeup, Hokuto casually strolls around the room, surveying the array of costumes, props, and Taiga's personal things scattered around. They stay silent for some time.</p><p>"Nice dressing room you've got here, by the way," Hokuto comments after a while, running a finger over a nearby table and then scanning the room with his gaze. "But how do you always manage to spread your things around like this?"</p><p>"I find it useful when things are scattered. They're all in my sight, and that's helping me not to get them lost," Taiga says.</p><p>Hokuto hums. "Well, your method might be a bit unconventional, but if it works for you, who am I to judge? We've followed this scattered arrangement of yours over the years. It's become a bit of a trademark of yours and seems to work well enough."</p><p>Taiga chuckles. "Right. But hey, at least I have my own dressing room here. I can spread my belongings around the room as much as I want. Until my members come to tease me about it."</p><p>He places his costume watch on the table. "Why did you come here, by the way?" he then asks directly. Because the visit was so sudden, and he wasn't mentally prepared.</p><p>"Your dressing room? I came here to check what the behind-the-scenes look like. You know, also for inspiration."</p><p>"Inspiration for what? A surprise cameo in my next musical?"</p><p>"You never know. I might be preparing for Hokutopus' dramatic entrance." Hokuto chuckles, clearly enjoying Taiga's discomfort as Taiga grimaces at that.</p><p>As Hokuto goes to sit down on the couch, Taiga can't help but notice the mischievous twinkle staying in his eyes. He really seems to be in a playful mood today.</p><p>"No, but tell me. What's the real reason for your sudden appearance?" Taiga presses.</p><p>Hokuto shrugs. "Well, as far as I know, in this group called SixTONES, the members tend to come to watch each other's individual jobs and show some support."</p><p>"I mean, usually, we inform each other beforehand in the group chat."</p><p>"Would it really make such a difference?" Hokuto asks. It's Taiga's turn to shrug.</p><p>"Anyway," Hokuto continues. "I just thought it would be fun to surprise you. And apparently, I managed to do that. Maybe no need to always leave a trace behind oneself or announce all things to the whole world."</p><p>"Fair enough," Taiga concedes.</p><p>Hokuto pulls out a musical program booklet from his bag, and Taiga raises his eyebrow at that. "You got that?"</p><p>"I bought it. Told you I'm a fan of the lead actor. He sings so well. I'm the lucky one to have him in the same group with me."</p><p>"I'm not that good, really," Taiga says. If he's not good at taking compliments, he never stops being self-concerned about his singing either because he truly thinks there's still a long way to go for him. And honestly, the combination of both together, getting compliments <i>about</i> his singing, is something that he seriously can't handle.</p><p>"You should finally learn to take some compliments from your members. Admit it, Kyomoto, you enjoy the spotlight," Hokuto says.</p><p>"I enjoy the spotlight on stage, not in my dressing room. Now, if you don't mind, I want to shower without an audience."</p><p>Hokuto nods and stands up. "Alright. Enjoy your shower time. I'll go and say hi to the rest of the crew meanwhile."</p><p>*****</p><p>As Taiga steps out of the shower, he's unsurprised to find Hokuto back in his dressing room, a musical program booklet in his hands again, absorbed in reading its contents. With messy hair, no trace of makeup, and a simple gray sweatshirt, Hokuto looks remarkably young, stirring a flutter of butterflies in Taiga's stomach all of a sudden. While the version of Hokuto in performance outfits with bare arms is undoubtedly attractive, this more unguarded side of Hokuto is downright endearing.</p><p>Taiga quickly changes into a comfy T-shirt and sweatpants. He feels immediately more like himself. He's always been more into personal comfort rather than the latest fashion trends. While he's been thinking and talking about getting more fashionable clothes, it has mainly been only talk with no action so far. And after all, Hokuto would be the last person on earth to care the slightest about what Taiga wears.</p><p>A comfortable silence surrounds them as Taiga stands by the mirror with his back to Hokuto, applying some toner to his face.</p><p>Taiga steals glances at Hokuto through the reflection. He's still reading the program, probably Taiga's interview in it, leaning against his knee as he flips through the pages.</p><p>Other people who don't understand that kind of comfortable silence tend to say it's awkward and unpleasant. But for Taiga, such moments with Hokuto are almost the best thing when he thinks about their relationship; it's very nice to notice there's no need for constant chatting or engaging in activities that leave him merely drained these days. Taiga likes that he doesn't have to force conversations or pretend to be someone he's not when he's with Hokuto.</p><p>And it's not just for him. Taiga has seen Hokuto manage this with others, too. Hokuto is really good at making quiet moments where everyone feels comfortable without needing to say too much.</p><p>When Taiga starts to dry his hair, he feels a soft graze of fingers against his hip.</p><p>"Why did you even bother showering now if you're going to need another one later again? Or putting clothes on if we'll take them off in an hour?"</p><p>He feels the soft laugh against his ear before arms wrap around his waist, and Taiga feels a firm front press against his back. Hokuto's only like this when nobody's watching.</p><p>"You want me to go around naked and embarrass myself, the whole staff, and our whole group?" Taiga asks. He turns the hairdryer off, puts it on the table, and leans back a little bit, finding solace in Hokuto's warm embrace. He raises his hand and strokes Hokuto's cheek tenderly with it.</p><p>"Mmmmh, I guess I'm just being lazy."</p><p>Hokuto buries his face into the curve of Taiga's shoulder, inhaling slowly, a gesture that brings a gentle warmth over Taiga.</p><p>It also triggers a memory, one from a few years back that also happened in a dressing room.</p><p>They had been in that weird situation for a while before that, a kind of limbo where neither of them really knew how to act around the other. During this strange time, their communication became a bit tense. Conversations that used to flow easily started feeling more or less forced. It was like they were both unsure about what to say, and the worst thing was that there was the constant feeling of <i>needing</i> to say something and fill the uncomfortable silence with any kind of conversation. The carefree vibe from their teenage years had seemed to fade completely, replaced by a weird discomfort. Something had changed between them. They avoided eye contact with each other, Hokuto stopped calling Taiga by a cute nickname, and Taiga didn't invite Hokuto to join him for shopping any longer. It took a while until Taiga realized what was the reason behind all this behavior.</p><p>Which leads to the memory part.</p><p>After the performance in the dressing room, Taiga's hand found the small of Hokuto's back, their eyes locking in silent agreement. The next moment, he pressed Hokuto against the wall, sharing such a long, good kiss. This particular kiss, so remarkably good and delicious, effortlessly outshone every single one he had experienced with anyone else before. Hokuto's fingers tenderly traced through Taiga's hair as if erasing all the discomfort and unspoken tension that had existed between them. Ever since, their silent moments may have remained silent, but there has been nothing unpleasant in them any longer.</p><p>"What if someone walks in?" Taiga asks, coming back to reality as Hokuto keeps his face nestled against his clothed shoulder.</p><p>"Then, maybe we better get going before that happens?"</p><p>They part from their hug, and Hokuto has <i>that</i> smile on his face, the one he's reserved for Taiga when nobody else is watching.</p><p>"Alright, let's head out then," Taiga agrees, returning the smile.
There's no need for a discussion; both of them are more than familiar with this routine.</p><p>*****</p><p>"I'm the luckiest fan ever," Hokuto says as Taiga pushes him to sit on the bed. Then he climbs to straddle Hokuto and starts grinding against him. He doesn't join the joke, so he simply seizes Hokuto's neck and draws him into a hungry kiss.</p><p>Hokuto eagerly parts his lips, biting down on Taiga's bottom lip before tracing the same spot with his tongue. Taiga makes no move to stop him as Hokuto's hands boldly explore his body, then moving behind him and gripping his buttocks firmly. As the kiss breaks, Hokuto starts kissing Taiga's neck, trailing his lips from the base of his ear to the small hollow where his collarbones meet.</p><p>Thankful for Hokuto's initiative, Taiga simply enjoys the moment, letting go of control. He moans, and then Hokuto guides him to raise his arms, pulling the shirt over his head. Taiga returns the favor for Hokuto, helping him shed his shirt and then throwing it on the floor.</p><p>They share another kiss, and Hokuto's fingers hook into the seam of Taiga's pants, slowly lowering them a few inches. He starts to gently caress Taiga's lower back, tracing the curve where his ass begins. Meanwhile, Taiga rubs Hokuto's chest with his hands, running his fingers over the hardened nipples.</p><p>Taiga urges Hokuto to lie on his back, joining him. They slowly undress each other, the pace intentionally languid as they work to maintain the connection of their mouths while their hands explore every inch of exposed skin.</p><p>When they start rubbing their erections together, Taiga thinks he could probably come like that, but he wants Hokuto to fuck him.</p><p>Taiga signals for a change, transitioning onto his side with Hokuto behind him. The audible pop of a cap follows, indicating Hokuto's preparation for lubricating his fingers before he partially hovers over Taiga. Hokuto grabs Taiga's leg, drawing it toward his chest before gently pressing a lubed finger inside him.</p><p>Taiga's yearning for more must be unmistakable in the way he grunts and moves, wiggling and grinding his side against the mattress—clear signals for Hokuto to hurry up.
Despite this, Hokuto takes his time, gradually advancing to two fingers and scissoring him open.</p><p>"Hokuto, I'm ready."</p><p>Removing his fingers, Hokuto leans in to kiss Taiga while deftly reaching for the condom. As Taiga settles onto his back, he watches with anticipation as Hokuto rolls the condom on, positions himself, and guides his cock toward Taiga's entrance.
The initial push is deliberate and unhurried, providing a satisfying sensation of gradually being filled by Hokuto. The pleasure intensifies as Hokuto establishes a steady rhythm of thrusts.</p><p>Hokuto leans forward, exerting pressure against the back of Taiga's thighs while Taiga's knees tuck above his shoulders. The feeling of stretch remains pleasant, a subtle burn adding a satisfying sensation to his already fatigued muscles.
Instinctively, Taiga reaches out, his hands gripping Hokuto's skin with just enough pressure to evoke a gratifying groan. Hokuto's muscles tense as he supports himself, gradually intensifying the rhythm with each thrust.</p><p>Hokuto adeptly grabs Taiga's arms, securing them above his head as he leans over him. At that moment, Taiga feels Hokuto enveloping him completely in all senses - the strong hold of his hands, the pressure of his hips, the irregular rhythm of his breath, the intense way he watches Taiga under his eyebrows, and the luscious roughness in his voice as he moans. Each thrust elicits a pleasurable pull in Taiga's gut, bringing him closer and closer.</p><p>The mattress emits a small squeak with each thrust. The heat intensifies in his lower stomach until, without warning, Taiga sees white and feels his own release pooling between himself and Hokuto.
Overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment, Taiga instinctively hits his head against the mattress and closes his eyes, savoring the lingering feeling of his climax. Hokuto pulls his cock out.</p><p>Opening his eyes, Taiga observes Hokuto removing the condom and then beginning to jerk himself. With half-lidded eyes and slight sweat on his forehead, Hokuto above him creates a captivating sight that Taiga wants to stare at despite his slightly blurred vision. Eventually, Hokuto releases his cum onto Taiga's stomach.</p><p>Hokuto's warm breath caresses Taiga's neck as he settles beside him. He reaches out with one hand for a couple of napkins from the nightstand and wipes Taiga's stomach clean with them.</p><p>"I'm seriously the luckiest fan in the world," Hokuto then murmurs against Taiga's neck, causing a subtle tickle.</p><p>"Way to kill the post-orgasm afterglow," Taiga hums.</p><p>"Thank you, anyway," Hokuto adds, ignoring him. "It felt good. You felt good."</p><p>Upon hearing Hokuto's words, Taiga feels a warm yet bittersweet sensation in his chest. The kiss they shared in the dressing room years ago seemed to resolve many things all at once, yet Taiga hadn't quite thought through what the next step would be. Since the beginning, he's been unsure if this is just a casual thing between group members or something more profound. He doesn't know either what he himself exactly wants. What he does know is that he doesn't want to get his hopes up. But then again, there's comfort in the thought that they have all the time in the world to figure things out.</p><p>"Likewise," Taiga says. "You always feel good."</p><p>Hokuto's arms wrap around him in the next moment, and it immediately soothes the feeling in his chest a little bit. Taiga has no intentions of moving for a long time, and luckily, Hokuto seems to have the same idea.</p><p>"Stay for the night this time?" Taiga suggests, turning so that he's now facing Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto looks at Taiga, thinking for a moment. Eventually, he smiles. "I'd like that."</p><p>Maybe that's a new beginning of something.</p><p>"And next time, maybe warn me beforehand if you're coming to see my musical."</p><p>"It would lead to the same result anyway."</p><p>Taiga laughs. Hokuto's right.</p><p>Time is indeed on their side. And Jesse, with his vivid romance fantasies about them, but that's a whole other story.</p>
