        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello~ welcome to another one of my attempt to make genderbend!hokuto. To set your expectations, this fic does not have much substance. I set this in 2022 despite them being 10 year older than the age I made them to be in this AU so there's that. This really is just an idea that kept playing around in my mind so for my own inner peace, I wrote out five different parts for this with full dedication.</p><p>I am hoping this will still be worth your time.</p></blockquote>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Matsumura and Morimoto.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="right">
  <span>Morimoto and Matsumura.</span>
</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Whichever name comes up first, the other always follows right after. How could anyone think of one without the other? The two have practically been inseparable since birth. One does not exist without the other.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi and Shintaro were born to college best friends mothers. Their mothers swore to live right next to each other for the rest of their lives ever since they got assigned the same room in a  college dorm. Both worked hard in their individual careers and were able to buy houses that were right next to each other in a neighborhood near private schools where they inquired a lot and targeted as schools for their future children. The two even went as far as going to blind dates as a duo and only seriously dated men that accepted the living arrangement.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their mothers got married in the same year and miraculously got pregnant in the same month as well. People around them wondered what kind of ritual the best friends did for them to give birth on the same day.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was born an hour earlier than Shintaro. Their mothers even got a private room at the hospital with two beds. Keeping the two babies in the middle of their beds. The two planned for the two kids’ rooms to be right in front of each other, with a terrace connecting them together for the kids to play at each other’s rooms and get home easier.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>To say that Hokumi and Shintaro have been together since their birth was nothing short of the truth. In every Matsumura gathering and celebration, Shintaro was there. In every Morimoto gathering and celebration, Hokumi was there.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As planned, the two attended the same school. They were never a handful. Thankfully, the two got along really well. Hokumi made up for Shintaro's lack of wit while Shintaro made up for Hokumi's lack in strength.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In their earlier years, the two shared the same interest in the toys and activities they do. As they grew older, they slowly discovered things that only one of them was interested in. Hokumi spent most of her free time reading. Shintaro started playing more video games. While Shintaro was still able to get Hokumi to play games and Hokumi got Shintaro to read books, there were times when they were in the same room but doing different things.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their parents never bothered to put a distance between them or have them spend less time with each other. They preferred them being around each other. They did not even care if the two were inside a room with the door closed. They have let them fall asleep in the same bed since they were younger and they never thought about stopping them from doing it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Due to Hokumi's parents both working in the hotel and tourism industry, they were away from home a lot. Instead of leaving her home alone or getting a housemaid to accompany her home, Hokumi instead spent nights over at the Morimotos. It was either that or Shintaro would stay over her room and sleep there.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi and Shintaro used to have their own bubble they lived in. All through their grade school years, they did not bother making friends with the rest of the class. They did socialize with them and communicated, but once the bell rings it's just the two of them that mattered.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Both were still able to qualify for the same senior high school. The only change was that now they opened their world to having other friends. Still, even when they had plans with their separate group of friends, the two came home together. The two still prioritized each other and spent more time together than with their group of friends.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Message me when you're about to wrap things up with your friends," Shintaro said as they stopped in front of the café Hokumi and her friends were spending the afternoon at. "Wait for me here, okay? I don't want you standing alone around internet café areas, alright?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi's friends went ahead inside to find them a table. They have gotten used to Shintaro and Hokumi talking things over first before they get Hokumi's company.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi chuckled. "I know, I know. Are you sure you don't want to eat tiny cakes with us and have tea?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Nah. I told the boys I'll play on their team today. Apparently, they got into a heated fight with a different school so today's game seems serious."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Don't worry. I'll get some tiny cakes to go for you so you can have it as dessert after dinner."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yes, please! That will be awesome." Shintaro glanced over Hokumi's friends and waved goodbye to them. "I should get going. Enjoy your girl time."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Go bro it out or something." Hokumi said before going inside the café. "Sorry that took long."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"We're used to it," Taiga said as she handed Hokumi the menu. "We've already chosen what we want. We'll order once you decide on something."</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro placed his phone right in front of him and played without the headphones on. He would rather miss out on the game's sound effects than not notice Hokumi's message coming. Besides, his team mostly communicated via chats, the headphones were not really that essential to the game.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hey, you should really come to the next swim meet,"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>This was the downfall of not having headphones on at the internet café, Shintaro was susceptible to hearing random conversations from people he doesn't even know. The voice was not familiar to him he assumed it must be someone from a different school.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You have to go. Our school is going compete against Minami High,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>That statement confirms it. But since they were talking about the swim meet, Shintaro listened in as both he and Hokumi were part of Minami High's varsity swimmers.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Their female star swimmer is especially worth seeing. I've watched her compete even in her junior high days. But man, the gods must have blessed her a little too much. All the curves are there and boy if you see her titties. So when you go watch the swim meet, keep your eyes open for Matsumura Hokumi and her cans."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What the fuck did you say?!" Shintaro shouted as he pushed away his chair when he stood up. He scanned the place for the boy with the foul mouth and pulled him out of his seat. "The fuck did you say about the swim meet."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh shit. You're Minami High's Morimoto. Fuck. You heard that?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro got it right after grabbing the first boy he saw that was laughing. "I sure as fuck am Morimoto of Minami High. And I won't let you talk about Hokumi like that!" </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro landed three punches to the boy's face before the other players around them caught wind of what was happening. The boy's nose was already bleeding before someone successfully pulled Shintaro off of him. Several other students was what it took to hold Shintaro down. The boy's friends was able to sneak in a few punches while Shintaro was being pulled away.</span>
</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, sorry. Shin's calling." Hokumi said as she answered her ringing phone.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Please, come to the police station. My mom might kill me if she's the only one who shows up here."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Police station!?" Hokumi abruptly stood up and grabbed her bag. She merely gave her friends an apologetic bow before leaving without an explanation.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Lucky for her, she was able to catch a cab easily.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi's hands were shaking on the way to the police station. Shintaro's strong trait was never his patience but this was the first time that he was detained at a police station.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, dear, thank you for being here." Kaede, Shintaro's mother, said as soon as they saw each other in front of the police station. Kaede arrived just a few seconds behind Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Kaede-san, I'm sure Shin has a good explanation for this."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kaede scoffed. "I'm sure he does."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was asked to stay at the lobby area while Kaede talked over the arrangement with Shintaro to the officers in charge.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>On the way back to their place, Hokumi and Shintaro were both given the silent treatment by Kaede. Shintaro looked out the window the whole ride, avoiding starting a conversation with Hokumi and Hokumi just sat there in silence as well. If anyone was strict with them, it was Kaede. Hiromi, Hokumi's mother, was always very lenient with them. While Hiromi was very meticulous with everything, she was much more relaxed with child discipline as she wanted the two to learn and make mistakes of their own. Taisei, Hokumi's father, and Hiroyuki, Shintaro's father, loved to act as a middle ground for the mothers but almost always stayed out of the way until either Hokumi or Shintaro asked them to get involved. All four of them have learned not to get in the way of either Kaede or Hiromi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hokumi, dear, would you be as kind as to order us our dinner tonight. Get me anything that has vegetables and get this boy anything at all. You can come up to Shin's room for now. I need to talk to him alone."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Excuse me," Hokumi bowed her head and took Shintaro's bags before she made her way to Shintaro's room.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Would you mind explaining to me what the hell happened to you? You got sent to the police station and you have cuts on your face?!" Kaede said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi kept the door of Shintaro's room slightly ajar to hear their conversation. There was silence between the mother and son, Shintaro refused to answer the question. Kaede repeated herself but there was still nothing. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi did as she was told and ordered food enough for four, assuming Shintaro's father would be joining them for dinner.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There was still silence. Shintaro still refused to talk. Which was unusual since he was not usually like this. He alway openly admitted why he got into a fight on the very rare occasions that he did.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their dinner arrived and so did Shintaro's father. But Kaede's question was still unanswered.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Your mother messaged me that you got in a fight," Hiroyuki broke the silence at the dinner table. "Those are badges of honor, my son. If you were in the right that is."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I sure was," Shintaro and his father fist bumped and laughed together.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm glad this incident amuses the two of you." Kaede said. "But we still don't know why he got into a fight?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Honey, come on. Boys will be boys. This one," Hiroyuki points to Shintaro with his chopsticks. "Shin's in high school. Boys get into fights. I promise you, I'll intervene and he'll get punished if it blows up to more than a petty fight."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kaede sighed. "Children, if you're done with dinner you can go back to your rooms and get ready for bed. I have something to discuss with Hiro."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi went to her room through the bridge made between hers and Shintaro's balcony. After washing up, she took her first aid kit to Shintaro's room.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Would you tell me what happened?" Hokumi said as she replaced the bandage of Shintaro's cut.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro looked at her and then down to her body before looking up again. "You should really let go of some of your clothes. Maybe we should go shopping this weekend?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Did you get into a fight because of me?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro nodded. "They were making comments about you and the swim meet. Your body in particular. I knew we'd have to face these kinds of things sooner or later."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Thank you, Shin. But try to refrain from getting your ass kicked or arrested. I don't want you to get in trouble with your parents."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Mi-chan, it's getting late. We should call it a night."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'll go back to my room now. I wouldn't want to accidentally touch your wounds in my sleep."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Scream when someone gets inside the house."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I got it, I got it. Rest well so your wounds heal."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi dialed Taiga's number when she got inside her room. "Taiga, I need a favor."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'll wait for you and Kyomoto-san at the mall? Are you sure? I can just go back here and all three of us can go to the mall to shop." Shintaro said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Well, I'm with Taiga so rest assured, I'm in good hands. Go play at the arcade or something while waiting for us. This will just be quick." Hokumi assured Shintaro before waving him goodbye.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi joined Taiga at their table and a few minutes later two boys joined them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Wow, we got the jackpot today, huh?" One of the boys commented as they took a seat. "Minami High girls are really something to look at."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga pulled out her phone. "Smile for the camera."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The two boys were startled with the sudden picture taking. They were ignored by both Hokumi and Taiga as the two girls typed something on their phones. The boys' notifications started blowing up and when they looked at their phones their eyes widened.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>Girls, beware! These two boys care more about your body than your personality. Keep your distance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The caption on an anonymous page said with the profiles of both boys tagged.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What the hell?!" The two boys said in unison.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Why are you mad?" Hokumi said. "I mean, this way we're even. If you'll comment on my body and make me the subject of your gossip, why can't I do the same to you?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You bitch!"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Lift a finger and my bodyguards over at the tables on our left and right will break your bones." Taiga threatened. The two girls stood up from their seats. "We're done here. Never show your faces to us, let alone step close to Minami High."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Have a good day with your moment in the spotlight." Hokumi said before they walked away.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">
  <span>Textbooks, highlighters, flashcards, pens, and notes were scattered over Hokumi's study area. Her desk was crafted to fit both her and Shintaro when they needed to study. Hokumi really liked how spacious her study area was, especially when she was up in the air with her random world buildings, puzzle building impulses, or any other craft projects she could think of.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Term end exam season was here. Which meant Shintaro had to endure meticulously planned study sessions with Hokumi after classes. No internet cafés for him, no café hopping for Hokumi. It had become a tradition for them to try and score higher than the other one during the exams. The number of highest scores you get equals the numbers of no questions asked favor you could get the other to do.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro was almost always the one that gets the shorter end of the stick. The only sure subject that he could score higher than Hokumi was physical education as it was more physical movement test rather than a knowledge-based test. He comes in close with history and music, so even after years of only having one favor he held on to some tiny bit of hope.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi never asked for too much anyway. It was mostly shopping and carrying her purchases, movies, or getting Shintaro to dress up so they could go somewhere fancy to eat. All things Shintaro would willingly do for her if she just asked.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin," Hokumi turned off the alarm set for their break time to start. "There's no hard rule about the favor, right? It could be anything at all."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Of course! So you better get your kitchen knives ready because I already have food I want you to cook if I get even just one favor." Shintaro said. "Why? Do you have something in mind? Is it very tough?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I do have something in mind but I don't know if it will be tough." Hokumi blushed. "I'll tell you once the exam results are out."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro opened his mouth to tease her until she spills about what's on her mind but he had never seen Hokumi suddenly blush like this. Her cheeks were still a bit pinkish. Shintaro could not get any words out of his mouth as he suddenly felt worried about what could be on Hokumi's mind.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The review sessions were actually more for Shintaro than Hokumi. Afterall, Hokumi was already top of the class. Shintaro was only at the A section because Hokumi refused to move there without him after their first year of high school. It was not that Shintaro's grades were bad, there were just students who ranked higher than he did.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The week of the midterms came. Unlike the previous week that was filled with reviews, their afternoons during the exam week itself were much more relaxed. Hokumi insisted they would do better on tests if their minds were relaxed. The best effort they gave to reviewing was to have a quick read of the flash cards or whatever they could finish in an hour.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The exams tired Shintaro out that he did not have much energy (or thinking capacity) to play games. Both he and Juri skipped the internet café but instead waited for Hokumi and Taiga in the same café where they were having cake. Only, the two boys had to settle in a separate table as girls time meant girls time.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Friday a week after the exams, results got posted. Hokumi scored higher in Japanese Language, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, English, and Fine Arts.  Shintaro scored higher in health and physical education. Their other subjects were not counted as they agreed to not include their elective subjects.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shintaro, I want to use my favors later. Could you come over later after you've washed up?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"After we have dinner with my parents? Sure. Are you lonely because your parents flew to Australia yesterday?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I'm used to it." Hokumi said. "Shin,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hm?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You can say no later, okay? When I tell you what I want you to do. You can say no. I won't force you," Hokumi blushed and bowed her head slightly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Do you mind telling me what you need for me to do?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Later. Just… after you wash up. Come to my room."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro could not focus at all during dinner. He could not keep up with the conversation that was happening. His thoughts were too preoccupied with what Hokumi could possibly need him to do.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was his turn to clean up after dinner tonight. Luckily, he managed to not break any plates despite being absent-minded as he washed them. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro paid closer attention to cleaning himself up while he showered because Hokumi repeated 'washed up' multiple times this afternoon it made him feel self conscious if he smelled bad. Especially since they had gym as their last class of the day. He thought maybe it washing up had something to do with the favor Hokumi wanted from him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was already on her bed when Shintaro finally joined her in her room. She was seated up with her blanket covering her up to her shoulders even with the air conditioning unit set at a higher temperature than her usual.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro sat on the empty side of the bed, stretching his lower body over the blanket. "Are you okay?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi nodded. Shintaro could see that she was nervous but he did not know what question exactly to ask her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin, this is something I can only ask you to do. I wouldn't really ask anyone else to do this. You'll tell me if you're uncomfortable and wouldn't want to do it, right?" Hokumi waited for Shintaro to nod in response before she continued. "I wanted to know more… understand the things I read better. I thought maybe experiencing the things I read could make me understand what I'm reading better."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Not gonna lie, you're making me a little nervous right now. You're not about to ask me to do anything that might hurt or put you in danger, right?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi bit down on her lip. "I wouldn't know. I've never done them before."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro let out a defeated sigh. He knew that once Hokumi has her head set on something there's no way anyone could change her mind. "I swear to tell you if I don't want to do it if you swear to tell me if what I'm doing hurts you."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi nodded. "Now that everything's clear, the first favor I want to ask you is for you to kiss me. Not on my cheek. On my lips. Like those kisses we see in movies and such."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What? Are you sure? It's your first kiss."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It's yours too," Hokumi pointed out. She moved closer to Shintaro, making sure she was still covered by the blanket. "Do you not want to?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Cut me some slack, okay? This is my first time." Shintaro gently cupped Hokumi's face. He leaned in to close the distance between their lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi closed her eyes just as their lips met. She moved her lips, urging Shintaro to do the same. Seeing as it was both their first kiss, it was sloppy. Their teeth hit each other and they accidentally bit the other's lips but they eventually arrived at a rhythm that was good for both of them. Their breaths mixed in with each other, pulling away to catch a breath before crashing their lips together again. Hokumi pushed her tongue past Shintaro's lips and licked over Shintaro's tongue. She slipped her tongue back when Shintaro caught on with what she wanted without having her say it in words.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro pried her lips open with his tongue this time. He licked all over Hokumi's mouth and his thoughts were drowned with how sweet Hokumi tasted. Their tongues played around each other before they pulled apart to catch up with some much needed air. Hokumi's face was red all over and Shintaro could only imagine that he might be as well.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I don't really have any point of reference but I liked it, Shin." Hokumi said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You taste sweet." It was all Shintaro could say.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Uhm, before we moved on to the next one. Could you close your eyes? Move a little bit closer to the middle of the bed," Hokumi moved a bit closer to the wall. "Then spread your legs, okay?" She pulled over to her side the blanket, leaving Shintaro directly seated on the bed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I won't count this one as a favor," Shintaro said before doing as he was told. He closed his eyes and blindly scooted over the middle part of the bed. He spread his legs apart but guessed he did not spread them enough as he felt Hokumi's hands push them further apart as she gets in between them.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You can open your eyes now."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro was greeted by Hokumi's naked back. "What the… aren't you cold?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shook her head. "We… we can stop if you're uncomfortable."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"We'll stop if you are. Knowing you, you're pretty set on really experiencing things you've only read about. I wouldn't want you to ask anyone else to do whatever comes after this, Mi-chan."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Thank you, Shin." Hokumi reached for Shintaro's hands, holding them with both of hers. "This is my second favor," Hokumi said as she guided Shintaro's hands to cup her breasts. "Your hands are so warm, Shin."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro froze for a moment. He had felt Hokumi's breast hit him countless of times but all instances both of them were fully clothed. This was different. His hands were in actual skin to skin contact with Hokumi's breast and they felt good under his touch. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi let go of Shintaro's hands. "Play with them,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Uhhh, okay." Shintaro started massaging Hokumi's breast in a circular motion. Gently squeezing from time to time which earns him a moan from Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"A little harder, Shin." Hokumi said in between her heavy breaths. She let out a longer moan when Shintaro cupped her harder. She fell back, landing on Shintaro's chest. "That feels good, Shin."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro has never seen this look on Hokumi before. She was blushed all over as she took in deep breaths between her moans. It was turning him on, pleasuring him as well. He tried his best to hold back, not do anything Hokumi does not ask for. But he slipped a little and pinched Hokumi's nipples without being asked to do so. Hokumi drew in a sharp gasp when he did.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Sorry. Did it hurt? I won't do it again."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shook her head. "I was just surprised. Your fingers feel nice on my nipples. You can do it again if you want."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro rolled Hokumi's nipples on his fingers before moving to gently massaging her again. Putting a bit more pressure from time to time as Hokumi seemed to like it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi reached for Shintaro's right hand, dragging it downwards. She guided Shintaro's hand between her thighs.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck, Hokumi. You're wet."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I read that it's good to be. It makes it easier. Shin, finger me."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck," Shintaro laid back on the headboard. "I've only ever seen fingering in porn. I barely know how to do it right. Do you really really want me to?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yes," Hokumi shifted a bit to gaze into Shintaro's eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro got too distracted by her eyes and before he knew it, Hokumi pushed his finger inside of her and they let out a moan in unison. Hokumi rested her head on Shintaro's chest as Shintaro continued to fondle her breast and pushed and pulled his fingers inside her vagina. His head was already swimming in pleasure as it is, now his blood was traveling a little further south. It takes Shintaro a bit of time before he changes the movement of his finger inside Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"More, Shin," Hokumi dug her nails in Shintaro's thighs as Shintaro added a finger in. She squirmed and panted all while Shintaro played with her. "One more, Shin. Please."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hokumi -"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Please," Hokumi pleaded.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro was just a boy. A teenage hormonal boy. He had no strength left in him to even argue. Besides, he had lived his life giving Hokumi anything she asked from him, why stop now. Shintaro pushes a third finger in.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"God. You're so warm and wet. Fuck!"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin!" Hokumi gripped tighter on Shintaro's thigh. "I feel so full. Don't stop."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck. How could I? Shit fuck." Shintaro was losing what little logical thinking had left. All thoughts were replaced with nothing but Hokumi and what could make her let out sounds of pleasure. He felt her walls pulsating around his fingers.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin!" Hokumi managed to say before falling limp down on Shintaro.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro felt even warmer and wetter inside her that he could only assume that Hokumi might have climaxed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You should wash up when you catch your breath." Shintaro said. He pulled out his fingers coated with Hokumi's cum and was careful not to touch the blanket with them. "I can just use the guest bath to clean up."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin, what about you?" Hokumi shifted and looked down at Shintaro's crotch. "You're hard."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Don't worry. I've been dealing with this alone for years now. Excuse me." Shintaro speed walked his way to the guest bathroom. He might have put up a good front but he was dying to relieve himself. He felt a little guilty jerking off using his hand that was wet with Hokumi while imagining the events that transpired just a few minutes earlier. But Shintaro could not help it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He had seen the same things done (and more) countless times in porn movies but the reality was so much more better than second hand experience. Hokumi had a point of being able to understand it better when it was an actual experience.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It did not take Shintaro long to come. He washed off his cock and hands before returning to Hokumi's room.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"That anime movie you've been waiting for is up for streaming. Should we watch it tonight or are you tired?" Hokumi asked. The television on the wall already had the movie flashed paused.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I wanna see it now. Are you still up for it?" Shintaro hoped things would not get awkward between them. He sat down next to her on the bed and let out a sigh of relief when she did not move away.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Thanks, Shin. I know I asked for too much. I enjoyed it."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I did too. But, don't feel bad, okay? I'd rather choose you to ask me to do these things unless you get a boyfriend or something. I can't bear the thought of someone taking advantage of your curiosity."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Protective as always, I see." Hokumi chuckled. "Don't worry. As long as we're both not dating anyone, I won't ask anyone else but you."</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">
  <span>A hypocrite.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>That was how Shintaro felt. After the various fist fights he got into because boys were making lewd comments about Hokumi's body, here he was jerking off to the memory of him touching his best friend. His Mi-chan. The girl he grew up with. Shintaro was conflicted if this was considered an invasion of privacy or sexual harrasment or something. It was his experience too after all.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was not that Shintaro has always been oblivious about a girl's body. He was not so innocent himself. Hokumi knew all about his adventures with porn and hentai. They even have things they read together. Shintaro just never thought of violating Hokumi's personal space (and body) that way. But then again, he was the lesser evil if Hokumi really wanted to do those stuff.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro washed off his whole body all over again. As though it would help him rid himself of the dirtyness he felt.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro dressed himself in his usual sweatshirt and sweatpants combination sleepwear before heading on over to Hokumi's room. He had never felt nervous about coming over for movie night, not up until what happened and what continuously happens to them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Stopping at the middle of the bridge that connected their room. Shintaro slipped both his hands on the pockets of his sweatpants, making sure the pants were loose enough in case he fails to control himself and have a hard on during the movie viewing.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin?" Hokumi called out from the balcony door. "Everything okay?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yeah, yeah," Shintaro proceeded to walk towards Hokumi's room. "Just wishing on the stars for luck tomorrow,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi chuckled while she walked to her bed. "The star swimmer does not need any more luck."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi pressed play for the movie to start. They sat side by side on Hokumi's bed. Shintaro held the bowl of popcorn, which meant Hokumi had to reach over to his side if she wanted to snack. Subjecting Shintaro to Hokumi's breast brushing on his arm from time to time.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Which made him remember how they felt under his hands. Shintaro remembered the sounds Hokumi made. How she squirmed in pleasure due to his touches.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin, are you okay?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Okay. I've been thinking about you. I've been thinking about the times I've touched you all over, okay? God!" Shintaro blurted out.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The silence that followed was excruciating. Hokumi just blinked and looked at him. Shintaro just wanted to be either swallowed by the bed or be given a chance to reset the whole night and not say what he had just blurted out.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Uhm, you're nervous about the swim meet tomorrow, aren't you?" Hokumi took the bowl of popcorn and set it to her night stand. "Would you like to suck on my breasts?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yes. Wait! What? Michan? Where are you getting this?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Taiga." Hokumi had a worried expression on her face as she continued to talk. "She told me that whenever Juri has an upcoming game, she helps him relax. Sucking her breast has proven to be comforting for Juri. So, since you're a guy too maybe it will help."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro flushed. He was but a boy, presented with an opportunity that no one would be strong enough to pass off. Hokumi had a genuinely concerned look on her face.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Let's try it," Hokumi unbuttoned her blouse. Revealing her naked chest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You're not wearing a bra?!"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi jumped a little on her seat. "I never do when wearing pajamas so I can fall asleep whenever." She said as though it was something that Shintaro was supposed to know at this point. Hokumi leaned back on the headrest of her bed. "Whenever you're ready,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro was reluctant but Hokumi kept urging him that he just gave in to his teenage boy urges. Shintaro felt Hokumi shiver on the first contact of his lips and her breast.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi's breast felt warm and soft on his lips. Shintaro licked and sucked to his liking, not really knowing what worked for him or for Hokumi but her moans and reactions were encouraging enough. Feeling a little greedy, he reaches to cup the other breast.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro looked up at Hokumi without freeing her breasts from his lips and his hand. He flicked his tongue over her nipple the same time he rolled his thumb on the other and watched Hokumi's flustered expression.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi's half lidded eyes met with his. Between her heavy breathing, she tried to muster a smile before choking up another moan as Shintaro moved his lips again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro sucked Hokumi's breast in one last time before pulling back. He buttoned up Hokumi's pajama top.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Did… did you not like it?" Hokumi held on to Shintaro's shoulders.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh god, I loved it. Honestly," Shintaro admitted honestly in hopes to rid Hokumi of her worry. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It worked as Hokumi's expression softened. Gently, Shintaro tucked Hokumi under her blankets. He  pressed down the switches near the bed, turning off the lights and the television leaving the illumination of the moon outside their only source of light.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"We have an early day tomorrow. You should get some rest." Shintaro slipped under the blanket, keeping the usual distance between them whenever they slept on the same bed. "Michan… can I hold you while we sleep?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shifted closer to Shintaro. "Our star swimmer is really feeling nervous, isn't he?" She yawned. Leaning in closer to Shintaro with her eyes closed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro wrapped his arm over Hokumi, settling his hand at the small of her back. He hummed her a lullaby, keeping a close eye on her as she drifted to sleep. Her warm breathing on his skin gave him some sort of comfort. Hokumi's breathing steadied eventually, making Shintaro be at ease that she was relaxed in her position.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Looking at Hokumi like this, despite her not being too dependent on anyone, not even him, she looked so fragile. Hokumi had always been independent and mature, but that does not stop Shintaro from wanting to protect her from everything that could hurt her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He swore to himself that he would always protect and put her first as he watched her sleep. He pulled her closer, careful not to wake her up. He sealed his promise to himself with a kiss to her forehead.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"CONGRATULATIONS!!!" </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The whole swim team raised their glasses of soda in the air. The other tables in the yakiniku place celebrated with them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro won first place for the boys division and Hokumi won third place for the girls division. The boys' relay team won first place while the girls' places fourth. Their coach decided to treat the whole varsity team to an all you can eat yakiniku place to celebrate everyone's hard work for the day.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As the dinner comes to an end, the swimmers were choosing which popsicle they wanted for dessert.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Matsumura-san, what flavor would you want?" Tina, the swim team captain, asked Hokumi. She leaned the list of flavors a bit to Hokumi's side for her to see it better.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Actually," Shintaro handed Hokumi her jacket. "We have to go. Our parents wanted to eat with us tonight."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi bowed in apology. She followed behind Shintaro, they bid farewell to their coach before walking out of the yakiniku place. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Thank you," Hokumi said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The streets were busy, it was after all a weekend. The sky was still in transition between ending the day and welcoming in the night. The street lamps were already lit up in anticipation of the coming darkness.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro took a turn when they passed by the convenience store. He headed straight to the ice cream section. He has not said a word yet but a warm feeling already crept in Hokumi's body.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Choose which one you want. We can have them when we get home." Shintaro already has his own selection on hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Have I ever told you that you're the best?" Hokumi's excitement could not be contained. Without having to think twice about it, she grabbed her usual flavor, strawberries and cream. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They took a cab home instead of walking the rest of the way home, worried that walking might make their popsicles melt even before they reached their home.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi has always been known for being a graceful, prim and proper girl. Especially when out in public. She was always regarded as someone with a high sense of self-preservation. But a person is not without flaws. Hokumi has a few of her own.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>One of them was never being able to eat popsicles without making a mess.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Once in the comfort of the Matsumura's living room, Hokumi and Shintaro cracked open their popsicles. Hokumi could only ever eat popsicles with Shintaro, the only person she knew that would not judge how sloppy she was with it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pushing out her tongue to lick the entire length of the popsicle was something Hokumi quite enjoyed. Licking off the melting parts first before pushing the popsicle inside her mouth to suck off as much juice as she could out of it while it was still frozen hard.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Beside her, Shintaro was enjoying his own popsicle by biting and chewing on it. Something she could not do as it felt too cold for her teeth.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What's wrong?" Hokumi asked when she noticed that Shintaro was gripping hard on the pillow he had on his lap. Seeing as they were watching a romantic comedy film, there really was no reason for Shintaro to look nervous.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro swallowed hard before he responded. "Nothing. Uhm. Can I use the bathroom for a bit?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Sure. Do you want me to pause the film?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Ah, no. It's alright. I'll just be quick."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was puzzled as to why Shintaro still had the pillow on him as he walked away from her but he looked like he badly wanted to use the bathroom and she just let it go</span>

  <p>
  <span>Taiga chocked on her parfait. “What the hell, Hokumi?” she coughed. She kept her finger up while drinking her water to signal that she was not done yet. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done to Morimoto-kun? I’ve seen you eat a banana, I could only imagine the torment you put him through from watching you eat a popsicle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Confused at what her friend meant, Hokumi could only tilt her head in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga was unsure whether to laugh or cry at the innocence of her friend. “Honey, sweetie, baby. You’re lucky that you have me.” She leaned in and explained to Hokumi why Shintaro reacted the way he did when they were eating their popsicles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri and Shintaro arrived at the café on their agreed upon time. Hokumi was preoccupied with what Taiga had told her earlier but she felt that it was not something she should confront Shintaro in public about.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So she waited until they were both washed up and ready for bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shin, I got us some popsicles."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"In this cold night?" Shintaro reached for the orange one. He sat at his desk chair next to Hokumi's. "Is something the matter?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi kept her eyes on Shintaro while she ate her popsicle. She has spent her whole life with him that she knew what his body language meant, she could read him better than anyone else. It goes the same with Shintaro, no one could read Hokumi's moods better than he does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro swallowed hard and averted Hokumi's gaze. He slowly pushed his chair forward, hiding his lower body below the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi pulled Shintaro out from the table and touched his crotch. For the seconds that she made contact with Shintaro's cock, she felt how hard it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hey!" Shintaro pulled away. Face turning red from embarrassment. "Oh, god. I'm so sorry, Hokumi." He groaned. "Michan, I'm so sorry. I swear, I did not used to be like this. But I'm a hormonal teenage boy now and those things we've done over the past weeks. Oh god, this is sounding worse as I go on talking. I swear I won't ever do anything to you that you don't want me to. Please, don't leave my perverted hormonal ass."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi chuckled. "Breathe, Shin. It's okay. We're fine. We're just growing up, I guess? But we're still and forever will be best friends." She bit down on her lip. "Sorry for suddenly touching you. You were acting weird the other day and Taiga told me you probably got hard watching me suck on the popsicle."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm so sorry, Michan. Believe me. It's not like I think about us like that all the time. Just… well, circumstances." Shintaro nudged his head on the empty packs and sticks of popsicles. "Don't worry. I know how to take care of it myself."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But I want to help you," Hokumi backed Shintaro's chair into the corner. She knelt in front of him with pleading eyes. "I don't know if I can do it right so you'll have to guide me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Michan, what are -" Shintaro took a sharp breath when his cock suddenly got freed from its constraints. He watches as Hokumi examined his length, gently taking it in one of her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shin, you're cock… it's bigger than I thought." Hokumi circled her hand over Shintaro's cock and gently stroked it. "It's so big and hard," Hokumi does not hide her fascination, keeping her eyes on Shintaro's cock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi kept her hand at the base of Shintaro's cock. Without any hesitation, she opened her mouth, engulfing the crown of Shintaro's cock first and little by little pushing the rest of his length as far as she could. The two let out a moan in unison when Shintaro's cock reached the back of Hokumi's throat. Hokumi felt Shintaro's thigh muscle tighten under her hand before he slowly eased up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This being her first time, Hokumi moved her head slowly at first, being too conscious of her teeth grazing Shintaro's cock. But Shintaro's reactions did not seem like he was in pain, if anything, his heavy breathing served as Hokumi's encouragement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi dragged her tongue all over Shintaro's cock, tracing the veins she could find. Shintaro's moans were getting deeper and more choked up the more that Hokumi moved around him. When Hokumi started sucking her cheeks in with every bob of her head, Shintaro gripped her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ho - Hokumi!" Shintaro let out a breathy moan. "Fuck. Sorry. Sorry. I can't hold it in." He weakly tried to push her but Hokumi fought him off with her free hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi worked her mouth and hand together. She held on with just the right amount of tightness on the parts that no longer fit her mouth, moving her hand up and down the same time as she bobbed her head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hokumi, please," Shintaro breathlessly pleaded. "If… you… don't stop… I'll…" Before he could even finish his sentence, Shintaro had lost his control and squirted his cum inside Hokumi's mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi did not stop. She milked out everything that would come out of Shintaro before pulling away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro took in a few deep breaths before he could ground himself back to reality. The reality that his best friend had just sucked him dry. "Fuck!" He hurriedly pulled up his pants and lifted Hokumi off the floor. He carried her in his arms to her bathroom. "Spit it out! Spit it out!" he said as he held back her hair. "Spit it out, Hokumi!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Spit what out?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh god!" Shintaro pulled down the toilet seat and the cover. Guiding Hokumi to sit down on it. "Fuck. I'm sorry. Shit. You swallowed my cum." He squatted in front of her while holding both her hands with his shaking hands. "I was too late."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shin, calm down." Hokumi chuckled in an attempt to lighten up the mood of a very panicked Shintaro. "I wanted to see if I could swallow it. I read that it was not too harmful to do so. But I had to pull back so I could swallow without accidentally biting you. Did you… did you like it? I mean, it was my first time so cut me some slack."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is my cum not enough of an answer?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have a point," Hokumi chuckled. "I liked doing it. I really enjoyed myself. But you might have been too sensitive from coming so I really had to stop."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have to understand, this is also a first for me. I don't know how to control myself just yet."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did it feel really good?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro nodded. "Do you… do you want me to make you feel good too?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If… if you want to do it. I won't mind."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro let go of Hokumi's hands. He kept his eyes on her as he pulled off her pajamas along with her underwear. He neatly folded it and placed it on top of the sink counter before kneeling in front of Hokumi. He parted Hokumi's legs, hooking them over his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi shuddered at the first contact of Shintaro's lips between her thighs. Tensing up from the first intrusion of Shintaro's tongue inside her. She vaguely felt Shintaro's thumb drawing circles on her thighs, an attempt to ease her up probably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro's tongue felt warm and soft around her, Hokumi eventually eased up. She drew in sharp breaths every time Shintaro's tongue grazed over her clit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shin," Hokumi talked in a breathy unsteady voice. "I feel… I fell like… I'll burst." Hokumi let out a choked up moan. Her legs tensed up as she started to feel wetter than she had ever been before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro lapped up his tongue around her before breaking contact. He wiped off his mouth with the back of his hand. "Now, we're even." He put down Hokumi's legs to let her relax better.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That was really nice." Hokumi was trying to catch her breath and weakly mustered up a smile. "I hope the pleasure I felt was just the same with what you felt. Because that was really something else." She took small steps to get to her showerhead and clean herself off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro took Hokumi's pajamas and underwear from the sink, helping her get them on as she still had a bit of trouble standing up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shin," Hokumi said when they got back to her room. "This, uhm, this set-up… is it really okay with you? I am really enjoying myself. But… are you okay with experimenting with each other?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I am willing to do this with you. As long as you promise me that you won't push yourself too hard."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't worry. I won't. I swear to listen to you when you say we should stop too, promise." Hokumi drew a cross over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I swear to listen to you too when you say we should stop." Shintaro followed suit. "It's getting late. You should get some sleep."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>In a school full of trust fund kids, many of whom were allowed by parents to do whatever they wanted, the students sometimes organized unsupervised trips. The oldest among the participants were mostly the senior students. The ones very incested in organizing and making sure the trip was worthwhile were the seniors as well. A sort of last hurrah for them before they face their university entrance season. The rest of the student body just came with for relaxation and the thrill of being in an unsupervised trip as a group.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi and Shintaro went during their first year out of curiosity. They have never gone on a trip with other people before. That trip was where they first spent time with Taiga and Juri, their assigned roommates for the trip. Since then, Hokumi had formed a bond with Taiga but Shintaro and Juri were just casually acknowledging each other and only ever really became friends after Juri started dating Taiga, they had to spend more time together waiting for the girls to finish their girl time that the two had grown comfortable with each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>During gym class, all everyone could talk about was the upcoming trip. It was decided by the seniors that it would happen mid-October this year instead of the usual winter break schedule. The pre-assigned room assignments were announced via the group chat for those who signed up to come. Anyone was free to make any changes or swap rooms so long as they inform the organizing committee for when they do headcounts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Morimoto-kun," Haruna, one of their classmates who barely even talked to Shintaro, approached him. "You're okay with rooming with Matsumura-san, right? My boyfriend got assigned to the same room as you so I was wondering if you'll agree to switch with me since you and Matsumura-san are… you know. Uhm. You two are together, right?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Together?" Shintaro glanced over at Hokumi who was in the middle of a table tennis match. He looked back at Haruna. "I don't know where you got that information from but Hokumi and I are not together."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought… since you two are always together… my bad." Haruna had a disappointed look on her face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But we are used to sharing a hotel room. We share one during family trips anyway."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh," Haruna's eyes lit up. "So is that a yes?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure. You can tell the seniors and I'll tell Hokumi after her match."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yay!" Haruna gave Shintaro a quick hug. "But I think maybe make it clear to other people that you two are family friends. It's not only me that has this image of you two being together."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, if it comes up just like what happened with you, we'll just clear it up."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thanks again, Morimoto-kun!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The teacher blew his whistle, the sound overlapped with the school's bell signaling the end of the school day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What were you talking about with Kawaguchi-san?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro cracked open a bottle of water and handed it to Hokumi. They walked a few steps away from their classmates on their way back to the locker room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"She wanted to switch rooms, assuming that the two of us are together."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi chuckled. "That's ridiculous."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is it though?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hm?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nothing." Shintaro cleared his throat. "Anyway, I said yes so she could room with her boyfriend. I hope you don't mind."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokumi nodded, taking one more sip of water before handing it over to Shintaro.  "I'll be more comfortable with you anyway."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center">
  <span>day of the trip</span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shintaro has only ever really hung out with his mom, Hiromi, Hokumi, and Taiga and from there he formed his perception of what girls liked to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>That was to shop wherever they go.</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as they checked in the hotel, the four of them: Hokumi, Juri, Shintaro, and Taiga, separated from the group that signed up for a Kanazawa trip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To Shintaro's surprise, there's a van waiting for just the four of them. They strategically visited the nearby museums and tourist attractions based on the distance from the hotel. Of course, Hokumi and Taiga always came back to the van with something from the gift shop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At some point, both he and Juri got tired of walking around and stayed in the van with the driver. Juri left the windows and the doors open as he smoked, never once forcing Shintaro to have one too. But due to his boredom, Shintaro himself asked if he could take a drag. Juri was patient enough to show him how it was done. It was not something he hated, but it was something that Shintaro was not sure would stick or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their last stop for the day was of course a shopping mall, right before dinner time. With the two girls spewing a type of color, shoe, bag, and skirt that the two boys have never even heard of before and do not really care about, Juri and Shintaro eventually gave up and separated from the two girls as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to get Matsumura-san anything?” Juri asked. His attention was on examining the differently designed berets in front of him. “Taiga does not really wear accessories that much but she does love wearing hats. Matsumura-san likes to accessorize, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro nodded. “I don’t know what to get her though. Besides, her birthday was June and I still have like a month left before Christmas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boutique they entered had a variety of hats and hair accessories. There were a few bows and hair clips that caught Shintaro’s attention, those whose designs seemed to go well with some of Hokumi’s clothes. He took photos of them and made a note containing the shop’s name so he could tell Hokumi about it later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dear boy, you have a lot to learn.” Juri patted Shintaro’s back. “You don’t have to wait for a special occasion to buy a girl any kind of gift. Trust me, she’ll be happier if it just came out of nowhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She probably already bought plenty. I can just bring her here later anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just get her something. God! It’s not like you can’t afford anything here.” Juri lightly shoved Shintaro to the direction of the hair clip displays. “I’ll even give you your money back if Matsumura-san is not the least bit happy when you give her something later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And if Hokumi is happy about it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll have the satisfaction of being right. Pick something out quick, the girls want us to buy anything for dinner. By anything, that means we should buy at least four options and prepare ourselves to eat the one they won’t choose.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro already had his eyes on a few pieces. He had nothing else to do but browse earlier as Juri was too occupied with choosing something for Taiga anyways. His mother had never really made a fuss about whatever he charged on his credit card. Not even on that one time, he brought a ridiculously large cactus pillow along with a newly released gaming console. Shintaro hoped spending money on a gift for Hokumi would still not land him any trouble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro bought two hairpins. Not wanting to overdo it, he chose the ones that looked simple enough for Hokumi to wear on casual days or even with her uniform. Juri stepped in when the clerk started asking Shintaro about how he wanted it packaged. Shintaro had never really brought gifts aside from Christmas and birthdays, those were the only packaging that he was familiar with. He had no idea what to do with something being given out of the blue. Thankfully, Juri seemed to be very knowledgeable about these things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, Shintaro had no idea how he should hand it to Hokumi. Juri was already right about one thing, they really had to prepare four options for dinner. Maybe, Juri was right about the gift giving too. All throughout the dinner, Shintaro was looking for an opening to hand in his gift. But he could not seem to get an opportunity, Taiga and Hokumi were still talking about clothes. Juri still had his gift for Taiga on his side, that at least gave Shintaro a bit of an assurance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It came to the point that they were back in the hotel room, already done washing up and were getting ready for bed before Shintaro had gathered enough courage to hand his gift to Hokumi.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro sat up on his bed. “I got you something,” he turned to the side, letting his legs fall over the edge of the bed to reach the box out to Hokumi who was still reading a book. “Uhm, it’s not much but I hope you like them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Shin!” Hokumi placed down her book in a hurry at the nightstand. She let her legs fall over the edge of her bed to face Shintaro. A smile was plastered to her face as she opened the paper bag. “They’re beautiful!” She looked at Shinataro while holding both pins in her hands. Her eyes lit up with utter joy. “I love them.” She looked at the hairpins with pure admiration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shintaro could not fight back his smile as he watched her admire her new hairpins. Juri was right about this after all.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokumi gently opened the door to her mother's study. It was a family rule to never knock on the door of the study but instead open the door and call her mother's attention. Door knocks break her mother's concentration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mom? Do you have time to talk?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Here or over dessert?" Hiromi closed her laptop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Here first and dessert after?" Hokumi said, taking a seat in front of her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Damn, I wanted to have dessert. But okay, later. What is it about, baby?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Birth control."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hiromi let out an airy laugh. She stopped to control herself when Hokumi stayed silent. "Honey, shouldn't the order be boyfriends before birth control? What does my seventeen year old who has not even talked about boys before need of birth control?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I read up on it and since I'm underaged, I need a parent to be with me at the obgyn if I want to get some." Hokumi kept eye contact with her mother. "I wanted to ask you if you're okay with it..?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Honey, are you even hooking up with anyone? If you are, I want you to be safe and I want to know if this is something you want and not being forced to do. Before I agree to take you, I need to meet the boy first."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mom," Hokumi sucked in her lips before speaking again. "I haven't exactly had sex yet. But… the boy might be Shin."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why am I not surprised? I'll book you with my OB but that does not mean you can have sex without a condom." Hiromi stood up. She walked to Hokumi's side. She pulled on Hokumi and embraced her. "Thank you for coming to me about this. But, honey, nothing you're not ready for, okay? I doubt that Shin is forcing you, if anything I believe it will be a mutual decision for you both. Let's not tell Kaede though. Shin should handle her."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So… dessert now?" Hokumi chuckled. "Thanks, mom. I'm sorry that out of all things I could try, I chose this. Not very prim and proper of me, huh?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Having sexual urges doesn't make you any less of a person, let alone any less you. I just didn't expect it to be this soon. Don't tell Shin that I know. The boy might get embarrassed."</span>

  <span>"Pretty, right?" Taiga swiped through the photos on her phone. "Juri and I were allowed by our parents to go on a three-day trip with just us. This holiday," Taiga pulled her phone back to her. "Do you have any plans for this holiday?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"My parents and Shin's will be vacationing in Paris. Shin and I decided to stay behind but we haven't really decided what to do for the break."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You see how you integrated Morimoto-kun in your answer when I only asked about </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>plan?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What do you mean? Shin and I always spend vacations together so isn't it normal that I do mention him in my plans?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga put her elbows up on the table, rested her chin on her hands, and kept her gaze on Hokumi. "Do you know why I always have plans with just me and Juri? Why it feels good when Juri touches my body?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Well, scientifically speaking-" </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hokumi," Taiga snapped her fingers. "I'm trying to tell you something here. Let me put it this way," she cleared her throat. "How would you feel if Morimoto-kum does everything, and I mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> he does with you with someone else."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi paused to think.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Do you even really like the food in this café, Shintaro?" Juri asked. "Aren't you getting bored of this?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Are you?" Shintaro chuckled as he threw the question back to Juri. "Kyomoto-san's not gonna like it if she hears that."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Taiga's my girlfriend. I'm literally required to sit through trying out drinks and food in this café while waiting for her to finish her weekly girl time with Matsumura-san. Sometimes, I can go to the internet shop with you, but most of the time we stay here. The question here is why do you subject yourself to this?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Because I have to wait for Mi-chan. That's how it has always been."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I know. I'm asking why. And don't tell me she's your best friend. Think of it this way, what would you feel if someone else was sitting on this table with us, also waiting for Hokumi? Or I'm sitting with someone else and you are at home. Don't tell me you'll still wait for her even if she has a boyfriend."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro had never thought of that until Juri spoke it in words. He glanced over at Hokumi and Taiga's table. Hokumi having a boyfriend was nothing impossible, she was smart and attractive after all. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro just does not know how he felt about it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Morimoto Shintaro-senpai,”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A girl approached him inside his classroom. Judging from the color of her ribbon, Shintaro knew that she was in her third year of junior high school.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yamamoto Maika-san..?” Shintaro read off of her uniform. “Did I get that right?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Maika nodded. “Uhm, can I talk to you in private?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro glanced over Hokumi’s chair. She had not come back from the locker room yet so he guessed she was not done washing up after gym yet. A few minutes of talking to someone would not really hurt anyway.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Sure. About what?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Maika glanced over the room full of people. “Is it okay if we talk somewhere else?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Uhm, alright then.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro followed behind Maika. They went down one flight of stairs from Shintaro’s classroom. Maika looked around to check if they were alone before she spoke.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Morimoto-senpai, I actually,” Maika was holding a letter on her hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro heard footsteps and when he glanced up Hokumi was on the top of the stairs. It was probably his imagination but for a split second it seemed that Hokumi narrowed her eyes. Shintaro stiffened when Hokumi made her way down the stairs.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shin-chan!” Hokumi called with a smile on her face halfway through the stairs. She wrapped her hand around Shintaro’s arm. “Sorry, am I interrupting something?” She looked between Shintaro and Maika.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Ah,” Maika retracted her letter to her back. “I was just going to ask Morimoto-senpai some advice for running track. I heard he was one of the fastes runner in your year.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh,” Hokumi did not sound convinced. “Shin-chan, we need to buy dinner today so if you’re done here I’ll be in the classroom, okay?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Ah, sorry, Yamamoto-san. I forgot I had errands to do. I’ll see you around,” Shintaro half ran after Hokumi. “Mi-chan, wait!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro was not foreign to the scenario earlier, he knew Maika was about to confess to him. He highly doubted that Hokumi did not have that idea. What he could not quite put his finger on was how Hokumi acted, it was unusual. Hokumi has always been reserved and never tried to walk in other’s conversation before, not even his. No matter how urgent it was, Hokumi always waited for her turn to speak.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro waited for a chance to open the conversation up. Hokumi seemed to be in a foul mood up until they left the school. Shintaro could not open the subject on the way home as Hokumi kept talking about what they should get for dinner and planning out almost every hour they have left before bed - between finishing their holiday homework before vacation officially starts on Monday and sparing time for their dinner.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Once home, Hokumi started fixing their work desk, laying out all her textbooks and notebooks by order of which one she thought would take the longest time to complete the given homework to the least time, explaining to Shintaro that they needed to prioritize Mathematics as the current lesson was not exactly Shintaro’s string suit - or rather Mathematics was never his strong suit. Hokumi always meant business when it came to holiday homework, she liked finishing them all off even before the vacation officially starts. As much as Hokumi loved to study, she also loved having to decide what to do on her time without anything holding her back from doing something.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro already forgot about opening the topic of what happened at school earlier. He really felt that Hokumi was not up to discussing it too. More importantly, he was getting tired as they moved from doing their Mathematics homework to doing their Physics homework without any break in between. Hokumi believed that taking a break would break their momentum and reasoned with Mathematics and Physics being related lessons anyway.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The thing that kept him going was the promise of heavy petting at the end of it all. Somehow, that was how their Fridays ended lately. A round of heavy petting before bed. It was relaxing for both of them, there were even times when it was not about chasing their orgasm anymore but just having a few moments of pleasure.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With the day particularly heavy for them - having gym as their last period and immediately working on homework right after they came home without any rest - it was not surprising for Shintaro that Hokumi fell asleep. With her falling asleep in Shintaro’s arm, her head resting on his shoulder, Shintaro had no choice but to stay in bed as well. Hokumi was sleeping peacefully and comfortably, Shintaro does not have the heart to move and suddenly wake her up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Having an idle time made Shintaro remember what Juri had told him the other day. The thought of someone else touching Hokumi the way he does, hearing her reaction, and holding her like this made him feel uneasy. Now that he had some time to think about what Juri said, he knew better how he felt. He hated the thought of having someone else fill in his shoes.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>But what was he supposed to do about it?</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Right after they had their breakfast, Hokumi and Shintaro got back to working on their holiday homework with the goal of not having any left for Sunday until the day they go back to school after the break. They lined up the liberal arts subjects because they decided it was too early to do any hard sciences.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hokumi, I’m coming in. Door’s unlocked.” Hiromi opened the door wider. “O, Shintaro’s here. Did I disturb you guys?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The mother and daughter laughed. Hiromi clearly meant something with what she said and Hokumi caught on to her mother’s tone.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Just homework, mom. Do you need me to do anything?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I was going to ask if you want to have lunch. We won’t be seeing each other much for the rest of December since your father and I are going on a cruise with the Morimotos.” Hiromi leaned on the doorframe. She glanced over at Shintaro and could not help but chuckle. “Shintaro, are you taking </span>
  <em>
    <span>good </span>
  </em>
  <span>care of my daughter? We both know her curiosity sometimes gets the better of her. Or maybe you did.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hiromi’s tone sent Shintaro into a coughing fit.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Mom!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Which in turn amused the mother and daughter that could not stop laughing.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Alright, I’ll stop. I’ll just be in my study. Go there when you finish your current task. Shintaro, you should come with us. It’s been a while since we’ve been out together. I’ll call your mom over, okay? I’ll leave you two now.” Hiromi closed the door.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A few seconds of silence had past before Shintaro spoke.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Does your mom know?” Shintaro said, almost as a whisper. “God, should we keep the door open? Or she doesn’t know and you two are just teasing me? Oh god, if she know about it then… god.” Shintaro hid his face behind his hands.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Relax, Shin.” Hokumi carressed his thigh. “It’s my mom. She won’t tell yours if that’s what you’re worried about. We can keep the door closed since she closed it herself and if it helps, she’s known for a while now. She never asked for us to keep the door open or anything.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh god so she does know! How can I face her?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi continued to caress Shintaro’s thigh in hopes it at least comforted him a bit. “Just like how you’ve always faced her. It’s not like I told her your my boyfriend. Relax, Shin.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How can I?” Shintaro finally showed his face. “How can I relax, when you’re mom knows I’ve been touching you inappropriately? How can I relax right now with your hand on my thigh?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shin,” Hokumi stopped the movement of her hand but kept it at Shinataro’s thigh. “My mom was just here and she was just joking around. If she was angry about anything or against anything, we both know how she doesn’t have a filter. She would have thrown you out with just the sight of you in my room. What’s important to her is that no one is forcing anyone to do anything.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t think I can tell my mom just yet. Not all of us have parents that will buy us books that is not yet recommended for our age. You do remember how she flipped out when she found the magazine I borrowed from Juri, right?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“My mom promised not to tell her. She said it’s something that you should discuss with your mom. Just like how I did with her. Don’t worry. Besides, you’re doing those things with me. I always get a free pass from Kaede-san. She likes me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’ll probably talk to my dad first. Boys understand boys better anyway.” talk to my dad about it first. Boys understand boys better anyway."</span>

  <span>Christmas Eve</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Despite having to spend Christmas eve with just the two of them, Shintaro and Hokumi still had a feast prepared. A feast of their favorite food. KFC, cathedral jelly, yakisoba, ramen, sushi, and potato salad. It might not be as traditional as what households usually had but the two just wanted to prepare food they liked. Even if they did not look like they would go together.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>With Hokumi being the one that was hands on with preparing the food, Shintaro was in charge of the cleaning duties. The two did not take their chances, knowing their habits, they knew both of them would be too lazy to clean up if they put it off for later. Right after they ate, they cleaned up the plates.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As part of their Christmas tradition, they had a few anime OVAs in line to play until they fall asleep. Mostly ones that they have already watched before that they planned to analyze from a different angle.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro found Hokumi's room empty when he got back from washing up and changing into his pajamas. The only sources of light in the room was the lone carousel lamp and the television. On the bed was a small box with a note on top of it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>Blindfold yourself and wait until I come back</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Inside the little box was a silk scarf. The one he was looking at when they went out to shop a couple of weeks back. Hokumi had always been one to plan out a surprise. This was probably part of an elaborate plan to surprise Shintaro with her Christmas present.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>At least that was what Shintaro wanted to believe. He indulged Hokumi's request as per usual. Admiring the scarf for a little bit with hopes that she would give it to him after, he tied it around his head with care. He sat still while he waited for Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Somehow, not being able to see his surroundings, Shintaro was more aware of the sounds around him. He could hear the door opening and closing, from what he remembered of the floor layout, it was the door leading to the bathroom. Hokumi's usual Miss Dior scent registered stronger in his sense of smell. He felt as though Hokumi was standing just a few inches away from him, her legs between his own but he was not quite sure as he could not see a thing through the scarf.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shintaro,"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro took a breath before he answered. "Yes?" He felt her hands hovering over his blindfold.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Nothing you're not ready for, okay?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro nodded. Hokumi removed his blindfold.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Holy fuck." </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>A provocatively dressed Hokumi knocked the air out of Shintaro's lungs. Hokumi was dressed in a sheer dress lined up with tiny bows around the hems and held over her shoulder by thin ribbons. Underneath it were lace underwear that barely even really covered anything. He had seen her in her dainty matching underwear and even naked for that matter but this… this was different. Hokumi dressed in sexy lingerie made Shintaro more aware of the curves of Hokumi's toned body.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Can I touch you?" Shintaro asked. Just looking at Hokumi already made him hard, it took a great amount of control not to lay a hand on her yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"As much as you want." Hokumi stepped closer.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro pressed his hands over Hokumi's dress first, roaming around the curves of her body, feeling her heat from her breasts, and working his way down to where the dress ended. He slipped his hands underneath the dress and worked his way up, stopping at Hokumi's waist.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck." Shintaro leaned his head on Hokumi's stomach. "Are you trying to tell me that your gift to me is touching your body? In any way that I want?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It could be for both of us," Hokumi soothingly ran her fingers over Shintaro's hair. "I do like your hands on me." She let out a playful chuckle.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro looked up. Hokumi's fingers were still on his hair. Their eyes locked together. "What if I say I want my dick inside you tonight and not just my fingers?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm ready for that too." Hokumi walked over to her nightstand. Pulling out a box of condoms out of her drawer. She crawled over to the center of the bed, purposefully making a show out of it. "You're going to need to lose some of your clothing too. For this to be fair."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro chuckled. He pulled over his sweatshirt and pulled down his sweatpants before hovering over Hokumi. "You'll have to be understanding tonight. It's my first time so I won't last long as the ones we watched on screen."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi laughed. "Of course I'm not expecting that. To be honest, I am a bit nervous. But I'm trusting you on this."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Maybe, my gift to you, is the gift of pleasure."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi sucked in a heavy breath when Shintaro pinched her nipple. Shintaro had worked front closure bras a couple of times and he had learned to unhook them with one hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I really do appreciate the effort, Hokumi. But these have got to go." Shintaro said as an attempt to try dirty talk and if Hokumi's breathing was any indicator, it seemed that she got surprised for a moment when Shintaro undressed her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Trying to take things up a notch, Shintaro removed Hokumi's lace panty with his mouth. He trailed kisses from her calf, working his way up to her thigh. Shintaro rubbed his hand over Hokumi's labia, making her body shiver a little.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hokumi, you're so wet. Fuck," Shintaro thumbed on her clit.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin," Hokumi said in between her breaths. "Are you enjoying this?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro licked over Hokumi's labia. "You're a feast," he looked up and watched Hokumi react to the first push of his finger. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi winced a little when another finger was added. She could barely get words out, breathlessly alternating between moaning and calling out Shintaro's name. She grabbed a hold on Shintaro's shoulder when he started sucking on her breast.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shin. Do it. Do me." Weakly, Hokumi tried her best to reach for the condom on the nightstand. She watched as Shintaro removed his boxer shorts and put on the condom. "Where'd you learn how to do that?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Believe it or not, my dad taught me using a wooden dick. I don't even know why we own one." Shintaro chuckled. "Uhm, are you comfortable enough? I mean, do you need anything? It's your first time, our first time, and it'll probably hurt you."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm comfortable enough on my bed. Don't be scared about hurting me. Trust me, I'll tell you when it's too much, okay?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro positioned himself, spreading Hokumi's legs as far as they could go. The tip of his dick was already feeling Hokumi's entrance. Shintaro lowered himself a little, Hokumi's breasts touching his chest but him not putting on too much of his weight on her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hold on to me, okay? Scratch me, dig your nails, pull on my hair, or whatever. I'm pushing in, alright?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi nodded. Shintaro kept his gaze on her, watching for signs of uncomfortableness or pain as he moved to push his dick inside her vagina. Hokumi winced when his head got inside. She whimpered every time Shintaro pushed even a little.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck. Should I stop? Should I pull back? Are you hurting too much?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shook her head. There were a couple of tears that escaped her eyes. "Just… distract me. Kiss me. Distract me with kisses."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro leaned down to lock their lips together in an unhurried kiss. He felt her whimper and shiver as he kept pushing in, her grip on his hair tightened. Both of them were gasping for air.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Finally letting out a long breath when Shintaro was fully sheathed inside her.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You're so warm and wet. You need to relax, Hokumi. You're too tight."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Give me a moment. I've never really had a dick inside me before." They both chuckled.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm going to move, okay? Just slowly."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Moving slowly was easier said than done. Shintaro really intended to be gentle, but his movements were sloppy as he had never really done this before. He slipped in and out at a alow pace but sometimes, he craved to be inside her a little too much that he forgets to be careful when pushing back in.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was eventually able to relax, the initial pain of the intrusion seemed to have started to subside. Shintaro was able to pick up his pace as Hokumi's walls started to feel more relaxed than earlier, making it easier for him to move his dick around.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck. I'm sorry, Hokumi." Shintaro slowed his pace again. "If I fuck you a bit harder and faster, I might probably already come."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It's okay. Please, go harder."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was a though Hokumi had pressed a button inside him. Shintaro thrusted into her at a faster pace than what he was previously doing. Words had been replaced by panting and the bed started creaking from how hard Shintaro and Hokumi were bouncing from their movements as they chased their high.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck. I'm sorry." Shintaro said before he emptied himself inside the condom. He pulled out of Hokumi and rolled over to the other side of the bed. "That was amazing. You felt amazing."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"So that's what sex feels like." Hokumi rolled over to her side to face Shintaro. "It hurt for a bit at the start. But it felt really good for me too eventually."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Now we have to go wash up again."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You can wash up here."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro nodded. "But you should go first. I'll change the sheet of your bed so you can sleep comfortably later."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Thank you, Shin." Hokumi planted a kiss on his cheek.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They spent a few minutes catching their breaths before they got started cleaning up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro took a while under the hot shower water, reflecting on what he had been doing for the past months. It was not solely his decision to do so, Hokumi was in on it too but Shintaro felt a little guilty about it. He was the man. He was stronger than her. He should have been more rational. But then again… he was just a boy. Fear and guilt filled his stomach. He trusted that his and Hokumi’s open communication can pull them through any situation but he still could not get rid of the knot in his stomach.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>By the time he got back to Hokumi’s room, she was already asleep. Shintaro turned off the television, leaving the carousel lamp the only source of light inside the room to guide him back to the bed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Mi-chan, are you awake?” Shintaro said in a low voice. He waited for a response but was only met with silence. Not really knowing what to say and not having the courage to say it to Hokumi awake, he let his words flow out. “Maybe I took things a little too far tonight, maybe we both did if I want to believe it was a mutual decision between us. I’m scared, Mi-chan. I’m scared how this would affect us. I don’t ever want you to think that I’m only after your body. I’m still your Shin-chan. I want to still be your Shin-chan.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi turned around to face him, her hand clenched on his shirt as she cried in his chest.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Mi-chan? Are you hurt anywhere? Why are you crying?” Shintaro gently caressed the top of Hokumi’s head, just like he always did when she cries during sad movies. “Oh god, did I hurt you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shook her head. “Shin, I don’t want you to do those things with anyone else. I don’t wanna see you with anyone else.” Hokumi sobbed harder.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey, where is this coming from?” Shintaro sat up on the bed, pulling Hokumi along with her. He noticed that Hokumi was having trouble breathing, crying, and talking at the same time. “I’m here, with you. Not anyone else.” He wiped off the tears from Hokumi’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The other day… when I saw you with Yamamoto-san. I didn’t like it. I don’t want it!” Hokumi’s lips were shaking as she talked, her eyes puffed out from crying hard and tears were still running down her cheeks. “I know this makes me sound really selfish but I don’t like the thought of you not being with me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“If it makes you feel any better, I don’t like the thought of you being with anyone else either.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Silence surround them for a moment. Shintaro put both his hands around Hokumi, leaning down to press a kiss on her forehead.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can I just have you for my gift? Not just for tonigh. Not just for sex.” Shintaro tightened his hold on Hokumi, enough for her to feel his warmth but not too tight to obstruct her breathing. “I can be yours too if you ask nicely.” He tried to lighten up the mood with a chuckle.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What would this change between us?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t know. But I know we’ll figure this out together.”</span>
