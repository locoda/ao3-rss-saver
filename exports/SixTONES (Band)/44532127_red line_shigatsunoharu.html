      <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This buried feeling he’d been dreading, it was like a trap.</p><p>Juri refused to believe that it was all over. Maybe it was just another day of shaky argument, maybe it was just Taiga’s mood overtaking what they had, maybe—there’s a lot of maybes going on inside his head, ringing, rummaging every corner to build up more alibis. </p><p>His fingers wrapped tightly around his glass full of Aperol, thinking this could be his savior for the night. To numb the pain, to escape the heartbreak. All his life, Juri had been giving away his heart, his <em> life </em>for Kyomoto Taiga and Kyomoto Taiga only. Now, the void in his stomach is eating him up, trying to consume his shattered heart, doing nothing to calm down the rush of thousands of emotions fighting up in his brain. Is he supposed to be angry? Upset? Happy? Juri literally forgot how it is to breathe without the very existence of the blonde boy.</p><p>Something was sinking. The blurring line in his eyes told him so. Maybe it was his feeling, maybe it was his effort.</p><p>All the maybes didn’t seem to want to stop any time soon.</p><p> </p><p align="center"> ══════════════════</p><p> </p><p>The lonely hours woke him up—Taiga is no longer sleeping in Juri’s hold. Not today, not tomorrow. In the dark, he could see his shadow dancing in something he couldn’t name. Regret? Fear?</p><p>They used to burn the city with sweet kisses and bear the pain of being against the world together. Taiga remembered how those slender fingers felt on his skin; full of flame, the voice of their once passionate love. </p><p>However, he felt tired. Every time they collided, Taiga counted how many times he had to walk out the door. Trying his best luck, picking up pieces, feeling all alone when he’s supposed to be there too. There was something they weren’t ready for. The burned city had turned to ashes, but for what?</p><p>Into the dark, Taiga realized no one was ever welcomed. He couldn’t fix what Juri didn't want him to repair.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
