      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Have you met someone, who also knows someone you know, and they also know someone you know? That's what Hokuto and Taiga learned, that despite their years of separation, they remained connected with the people that they know. But will these people help them to get back together? Or will they be a hindrance as old feelings resurfaced and new feelings sprouted?</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <blockquote>
  <p>“Men build too many walls and not enough bridges.”<br/>
― <span class="authorOrTitle">Joseph Fort Newton</span></p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>“...concerned with inequality: the changing, and sometimes unchanging, forms of global inequality, how they can be appropriately measured and how they are expressed in the international legal and regulatory architecture; within countries, how various forms of social discrimination and hierarchy affect economic processes and capitalist dynamics; how economic inequalities impact on and are affected by accumulation; the redistributive role of fiscal and monetary and financial policies; how power imbalances affect the world of work….”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“That was really enlightening, Mr. Kyomoto,” she said, and glanced at her phone, before looking back at him with regret. “I'm afraid we ran out of time, I really enjoyed this interview. I hope we could have round 2 of this amazing chat.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Likewise,” Taiga replied, thanking the interviewer profusely as they bid each other goodbye. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He normally doesn't use his lunch hour for work-related stuff, but the interviewer emailed him a list of amazing questions, he just couldn't say no. It was refreshing to do an interview that didn't involve questions involving his popstar ex-boyfriend. It had been two years since they broke up, but New York society would always remember him as that “ikemen” Japanese guy. Heck, most New Yorkers that weren’t weebs, didn't even know that word until The New Yorker used it for their article, and it even went on to become Oxford Dictionary's “Word of the Year”.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga sighed and sipped his tea, while he tried to ignore the two Asian women who kept glancing at his direction. People normally don't ask for his picture, after all, he was no celebrity, and it bothered him why they were giving him curious glances. A message from his secretary made him shift his attention. The investor they'd been courting for their newest business venture finally agreed to a meeting, but he had to go to Japan for it.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Uhm, excuse me.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga looked up and saw that the two women finally got the courage to approach him. Based on their cute familiar accents, they were definitely Japanese.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Yes, how may I help you?” He asked, thinking that they might be tourists with limited English skills and that they needed his help as another Japanese person.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Sorry, we didn't mean to eavesdrop, but we overheard that your name is Kyomoto Taiga?”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga nodded, the woman could certainly speak passable English to be needing his help.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are you Kyomoto Taiga -- the author?” Asked the other woman.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Hmmm,  I wouldn't really call myself an author,” he said meekly. He has co-authored two business books, and even did an English-to-Japanese translation, does that qualify as being an author?</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>The women didn't seem to notice his puzzlement as they both squealed in delight.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“We are huge fans of your work!” They said in unison and several heads turned in their direction. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Really?” He clarified, confused. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I love ‘The Maid in the Attic’,” gushed one of them.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“My favorite is the 'Nights with the Devouring Dame' series,” said the other, her cheeks turning to a deeper shade of pink.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“And we both became fans because of 'Blooming Bud Lessons'!" </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga fought to maintain a straight face. He had no idea what they were talking about, and they clearly mistook him for someone else. Other customers glanced maliciously at him, and it was easy to tell why, the titles they mentioned reeked of R-18.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“We just want to thank you for representing us, even though you're a guy,” she added.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Yeah, there's not much <em> yuri </em> in the market.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga almost choked on his tea. Not only was he mistaken for an R-18 author, but apparently, he also wrote Yuri.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He wanted to deny it so badly. There was no way he would want to be associated with such stories, but seeing the expectant look on the ladies' faces, he didn't want to embarrass them for being wrong. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He sighed and said with gritted teeth, “Thank you for reading my works.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>***</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Do you know what’s my favorite part of being an author? It’s when my haters curse me. There’s something so rewarding when my haters say, ‘You’re a piece of trash, Kyomoto Taiga!’.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro shook his head as Hokuto’s evil laughter filled the room. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are you a masochist? Of all the pen names, why use your ex’s name?”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Masochist? I’m a sadist and I want nothing but to inflict pain on that person,” Hokuto muttered, snapping his chopsticks into two. “So, no! There’s no way I would change my pen name even if you say that it brings me bad luck!” He finished with determination and fed himself with beef short ribs. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He knew there would be bad news when Shintaro told him that he would be treating him to a high-end beef barbeque. After all, Shintaro is a cheapskate, and for him to treat someone meant that a huge favor would be asked.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Then, please wrap up your current work nicely,” Shintaro said, still grilling meat and not eating, “it’s expected for readership to drop once paid chapters are up, but for your current work, it didn’t just drop in half, it dropped in less than a quarter.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“That bad?” Hokuto asked, still a bit baffled. He was never really concerned with sales from doing these web-style comics, in fact, 90% of his earnings were passed to his illustrators. His day job as a hairstylist was enough for him to live comfortably, given his celebrity and affluent clientele. It might be quite narcissistic of him, but he didn’t get how his current work could be this unpopular, not only it was well-researched, his current comic is his most mature and realistic work to date. Shintaro was right, a lot of his works were written simply for fun, take his “The Maid in the Attic” for example, none of his readers even questioned why someone who lives in the attic would be needing her own maid.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are the homophobes out to get me again?” He added. Lots of anti-LGBTQ loved to leave the nastiest comments on his Yuri comics. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro shook his head. “I told you this before, your readers are into your works because they were fun and unserious, with a bit of angst here and there, but the humor is always there. When you decided to have mature characters dealing with mature topics of a relationship, your readers just reduced.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Basically, you’re saying my readers are immature and didn’t want to deal with real-life issues of same-sex relationships,” Hokuto concluded. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I’m not saying that,” Shintaro countered. “But let’s get real, life is tough enough, I’m sure your readers just want to laugh instead of cry at the end of the day.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto nodded. He understood Shintaro's point, for the same reason that he avoided watching or reading anything <em> Yaoi </em>, it made him a bit uncomfortable seeing the sort of life he’d been living. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Very well, my editor,” he said, grinning. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“By the way, another reason I asked you to change your pen name was that someone, who introduced themself as your ex’s secretary, called our Abarero Agency.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto almost choked on the lettuce-wrapped beef ribs, before he descended into a coughing fit. “Shouldn’t you have told me this beforehand? W-what do they want?” He asked when he recovered. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“They were asking who was using the name Kyomoto Taiga.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Did you rat me out?” He asked, his eyes widening. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Of course not, we are not contractually obligated to reveal your real identity unless court-ordered.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto let out a sigh of relief. How did that jerk know about him anyway? “Good.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I know you’ve refused, but you might want to consider changing your pseudonym before they bring this to court.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto scoffed. “Who does he think he is? Is he the only Kyomoto Taiga in the whole of Japan? He might as well sue anyone who shares his name!” He argued with bravado. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Apparently, they checked. There were only 3 Kyomoto Taiga and the <em> kanjis </em> were different.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I don’t give a shit,” he insisted, rolling his eyes, “I’m going to keep his name and have my haters curse him on my behalf,” he added, raising his middle finger.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro sighed. “Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you,” Shintaro said, raising his all-free beer.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Thank you, but I’ll be fine,” he said, clinking his own beer can. As far as he knew, Taiga wasn’t even in Japan, and even if he is, Hokuto didn’t care. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“The son of a bitch broke up with me with just a LINE message, he would never have the courage to face me,” Hokuto finished with bitterness, before drinking his beer straight. </p><p>

  <p>
  <span>“Welcome back to Japan, Kyomoto-sama.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga smiled softly and handed his secretary his overnight luggage. He hadn’t been home for so long and as he took a steep inhale upon getting out of the airport, he was sure he was in Japan. His birth country just smelled differently; it was familiar but also strange. He felt homey, but also foreign. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“By the way, I booked a room at Le Grand, drive me there and not to my father’s,” he ordered, seeing that the car was taking the road that would lead to his parent’s residence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Kyomoto-sama.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There was also no need to inform my father that I’m in Japan. I won’t be long, I just need to meet an investor. I’ll probably be back in New York the day after tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Kyomoto-sama,” he replied, clearing his throat, while a growing unease unfolded in the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My father already knows that I’m here,” he concluded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My apologies, Kyomoto-sama, I didn’t know that your trip here would be confidential. I’ll make sure-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine. I guess it doesn’t really matter,” he interjected, not wanting for his secretary to feel bad that he quickly changed the topic. “Ah…what about the Yuri writer? The one with the same name.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“His or her agency refused to give their author’s real name without a court order. Shall I bring this to court?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga sighed. He didn’t want this matter to get big and waste his time or money. “Nah, I definitely don’t want to waste money on this one, just give me the address of the agency later.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His secretary nodded as the car slowed to a stop. Taiga looked across the road, pleased to see the Shibuya Scramble again, which he thought had no match with Times Square even though he passed by the intersection every day. He looked up at the giant LED screens and on one of them, a shampoo commercial was being played on repeat featuring the “IT” actress of the moment, and his heart almost skipped upon seeing a familiar face on the screen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...has always been the shampoo of our choice,” Hokuto said, </span>
  <em>
    <span>salon expert </span>
  </em>
  <span>caption underneath his name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stoplight turned green and the car moved swiftly. Taiga realized he was holding his breath as they left the famous crossing. There were two people he wished to avoid while he was in Tokyo, the first was his father, and the second was his ex-boyfriend, Hokuto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re here Kyomoto-sama,” his secretary announced. Taiga took a deep breath to calm himself, there was no need to concern himself with the past, after all, he won’t be staying long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What time will be our meeting tomorrow with Kouchi Yugo?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At 1pm, Kyomoto-sama.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“1 pm, huh? Call his team again if we could have it earlier, and if they agree, book an earlier flight back to New York,” he instructed and went down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He just couldn’t wait to get out of Tokyo.   </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want a hairstyle that says, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m not a virgin, but I’m not a himbo either</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto scowled, unsure what he could do to Jesse’s hair to show that statement. “I’ve been out of the dating circuit for a while, so hairstyles have sexual connotations now?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t act all too innocent, it doesn’t work on you” Jesse said. “And yes, there are hairstyles that just scream sex. Like if you see someone with a blond bald fade hairstyle, wouldn’t you automatically think that this man will surely hang you upside-down during sex?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto's brow furrowed deeper. “I’m sure you’re just green-minded, and I don’t want to be hanged either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse grimaced. “Do you know what I think of your hair?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto raised an eyebrow as he looked at his reflection. His hair had dried a bit after dying it brunette, but his locks had always been annoyingly straight so he developed the habit of curling it a bit for some volume. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your hairstyle screams that you haven’t been watered for so long-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto playfully slapped Jesse’s shoulders before he could finish, and turned to his junior stylist. “Color his hair purple.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Purple, why?” Jesse asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So everyone will think you’re an otaku and avoid you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh?! Wait a minute-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn’t hear the rest of Jesse’s complaints when he received 10 continuous LINE messages from Shintaro. He immediately opened it and his eyes widened in alarm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That idiot!” He said out loud. He zoomed in on the picture when his phone rang.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you see it?” Shintaro asked, sounding concerned. “It was posted as a comment below the latest chapter you uploaded last night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe this. How could he even think…of course, how could I forget that he’s a fucking people-pleaser and would rather agree than make someone feel bad?” He added, looking at a picture of two of his fans with the </span>
  <em>
    <span>actual </span>
  </em>
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve deleted it from our end. Unfortunately, it already made rounds in different fan cafes, forums, and even Twitter. We already made a request to those sites to take down the said picture, but it would probably take hours or days for them. Also, easy to see why this picture sparked a wildfire, your ex is really pretty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto clucked his tongue. He has zero interest in hearing that Taiga is pretty, which he is, but that was beside the point. “What should I do?” He asked, he was really clueless. He did anticipate a sort-of scandal that could happen from using Taiga’s name, but he never expected that it would be something like this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have you heard from their end?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. Not yet, but I’m just telling you just in case…” Shintaro said with caution. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto sighed. “Is it too late to change my pen name?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga thought his surroundings were spinning because of jet lag, but he realized that he was just too stricken seeing the news that his secretary had forwarded him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Kyomoto Taiga, as pretty as the women in his Yuri,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>was the headline in one of the leading manga news. </span>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why did I fucking agree to have my picture taken? Argh! What was I thinking? You pathetic people-pleaser!” He rolled back and forth on his bed in frustration, hugely regretting that he was too shy to embarrass his "fans", but he ended up compromising himself. Worst of all, the webcomic agency, Abarero, hasn't released a statement that the Kyomoto Taiga in the picture and their writer were different people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Just kill me, kill me, kill me," he repeated as more articles with his picture emerged. So far, he could still sigh in relief that articles were only contained to anime and manga networks, and no one had so far made his connection to a more famous Kyomoto, his father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"I’ve been working round-the-clock for the articles to be put down," </span>
  </em>
  <span>his secretary texted, but Taiga was still in distress. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let himself wallow in disappointment for a bit, before forcing himself to shower and get dressed. He still had an important meeting to attend, and that should be his priority. He would deal with the agency and his embarrassment later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kouchi Yugo had built himself a reputation for being a climate change champion and a prime investor, and that was the main reason Taiga's company wanted him. They didn’t want investors who were in it for profit only, they wanted someone like Kouchi Yugo who has the environment and the livelihood of people as his main drive in making investments. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How could he go camping in this weather?” Taiga complained as they rode the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shinkansen</span>
  </em>
  <span> to Lake Suwa where Kouchi Yugo was reportedly ice fishing. Kouchi’s team canceled their meeting all of a sudden, but Taiga was determined to keep up with his schedule. Avoiding someone is indeed an immense drive for him to leave Tokyo as early as possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think we would still make it by your 1 pm appointment,” his secretary assured him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should have taken the plane then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can’t, Kyomoto-sama. I read in a magazine interview that Kouchi Yugo avoided riding planes due to its carbon emissions. He would cycle or take the train instead.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cycle?” Taiga repeated with disbelief. “Fine. As long as this meeting happened. By the way, has Abarero responded yet?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His secretary shook his head. “Not even to my half-dozen emails.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga sighed in frustration. “What’s keeping them from releasing a statement? Surely, they knew what their own writer looked like.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It also puzzled me, Kyomoto-sama, they could easily outright deny it. I think they didn’t want to reveal their writer’s face as proof.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga gaped. “So they’d rather sacrifice my image?” He scoffed and added, “Fine. Fine. This is my fault anyway, why the fuck did I agree to a picture? I’ll take a nap, wake me up an hour before we arrive.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s no need to stress yourself on matters you can’t control,” Jesse said, his purple hair was so distracting, it made Hokuto put on his sunglasses. “Let your editor take care of those matters, besides, it isn’t so bad if your readers think that’s how you look like, a writer and a visual, you’re quite a catch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto feigned a smile. Jesse had no idea that Taiga is his ex and he was not ready to tell him the story of his life. He only met Jesse after his break-up with Taiga, and they instantly hit it off as friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are we going to Nagano?” He asked, changing the topic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse beamed as his cheeks turned red. “I’ve met someone and I think he is the one so I want you to meet him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto frowned. He is happy for Jesse, but he found it odd that of all the men Jesse had dated, this would be the first time that he would formally introduce someone to Hokuto. Moreover, they’re traveling to Nagano just to meet this person. “Nice. May I know his name?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Kouchi. Kouchi Yugo.”</span>

  <span>“I never expected that you would show up here,” Kouchi said, handing him a steaming cup of hot chocolate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Taiga said, sipping his chocolate. He knew he was courting Kouchi to invest in their company, he should be the one to adjust to all his whims, but it really irks him to be tested like this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I apologize for this abrupt fishing trip, the black bass are best when fished under these conditions,” Kouchi said with his signature beaming smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga smiled softly. “No worries. I understand that you’re a busy man, and making this sudden trip is no problem. I haven’t been in Nagano for so long.” He took a deep breath and rubbed his hands on the mug. He was definitely not dressed for ice fishing, he was so close to freezing that he subtly moved closer to the portable heater. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think apologies are in order,” Kouchi said after a while, or before Taiga’s eyelashes could develop icicles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga waved his shivering hand. “No, it’s really okay.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not okay,” Kouchi insisted, sighing as he added, “I really have no intention of doing business with your company.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga managed to maintain a straight face when he really wanted to scream. Did he just waste thousands of dollars to court Kouchi? Is this trip all for nothing? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was my team who wanted to form a partnership with you, they think that it’s high time we went global, and your company will be our starting point.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga couldn’t even nod or brag about his company, he was bracing himself for rejection as Kouchi continued, “Until I saw this-” Kouchi handed him his phone and Taiga almost stopped breathing seeing that dreaded picture that caused a thousand misunderstandings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can explain-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to,” Kouchi said, taking back his phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There’s definitely a misunder-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My opinion of you just got better,” Kouchi said, which made Taiga do a spit take. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“P-pardon?” He stuttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Call me weird, but I don’t hold businessmen in such high regard. They are greedy and unscrupulous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, aren’t you considered a businessman?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kouchi nodded. “Yes, but that’s the reason I chose to be more of a climate-conscious businessman. I cycle or use the train as much as I can. Not only do I reduce my carbon footprint, but it also keeps me on my toes. Makes me closer to the public. And I’ll never forget where I came from.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga nodded with awe, impressed, after all, he knew all about Kouchi’s rags-to-riches story.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So knowing you’re also an author makes you more human. You even write Yuri. I thought if you care about these relationships that people so often ignore, if not, won’t take them seriously, then surely, you must be a good person.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga swallowed hard, guilt starting to consume him, his gut feeling told him he should come clean, but the businessman in him told him to use this as an opportunity. In a sense, Kouchi was not at all wrong, businessmen are greedy and unscrupulous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga had no idea how he was able to smile and said, “Shall we talk about business then?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the – you’re dating someone this loaded?” Hokuto whispered. He couldn’t help but be awestruck as they were led to the living room of a two-story log cabin house near Lake Suwa. The room smelled of pine and cedar, and the floor-to-ceiling casement windows provided a majestic view of the frozen lake, while the fire crackled at the marble fireplace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse playfully hit him as he bashfully said, “Stop it! We’re not dating yet, I haven’t asked him out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh?! But you said you want to introduce him to me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I want to know what you think of him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto frowned, feeling that Jesse is withholding something from him until he realized something. The main reason Jesse would introduce someone to him for the first time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ahhh…what do I think of him? You mean, I'll have to be your fellow gay radar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh?!” Jesse said, feigning surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto slowly shook his head. “Can't you just ask him? That's the easiest way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I can, but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesse?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both of them turned and Hokuto froze on the spot. He felt like he’d been transported to the frozen lake outside; his body became cold, his breathing fast, while the ice below him started cracking that he needed to thread carefully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“How could the world be so small?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga glanced briefly at him, his huge eyes betrayed a surprise, but he quickly recovered and smiled toward them in a professional manner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have lots of visitors today,” the man beside Taiga said. Hokuto could only assume that this must be Kouchi Yugo. He looked younger when Jesse said he was only older by two years, and his smile radiated a field of sunflowers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry for this sudden visit, we were in the area,” Jesse lied as though they didn't travel for hours.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened to your hair?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse ran his fingers through his locks. “This is this man’s fault. He said this color would make me look like an otaku and people might avoid me.” Jesse pulled him closer and made his introductions, “Kouchi, this is Matsumura Hokuto and Hokuto, this is Kouchi Yugo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” Kouchi greeted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smiled, and a ludicrous idea popped into his head while he shook Kouchi’s hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi. I think Jess is just too shy to say, but I’m his boyfriend. We’re dating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh?” Jesse gasped. This time, his surprise is genuine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” Kouchi said, frowning at Jesse. “Why do you look so shocked?” He asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse grinned tensely, his nervousness looked so palpable on his face that Hokuto would find this laughable if he wasn’t involved.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well..I – I thought we’re not going public with it,” he reasoned out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand, after all, you’re a celebrity,” Kouchi said before he recalled that he didn’t arrive alone. “Speaking of celebrities, may I introduce a future business partner of mine, Kyomoto Taiga.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh? Your name is Kyomoto Taiga?” Jesse quickly remarked, darting an uncomfortable glance between him and Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you know him?” Kouchi asked, before snapping his fingers. “You must have read his works!” He added, which elicited Hokuto’s confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Kouchi continued, “Kyomoto-san here is also a Yuri author.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh?” Jesse gasped once more, looking more and more in pain from all these introductions. “But Hok– ouch!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” Hokuto quickly said. “I thought I saw a cockroach on your slippers,” he told Jesse before he looked sharply at Taiga. This jerk of an ex-boyfriend of his actually dared to claim his works? How dare he when he only used his name?! </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interesting,” Hokuto said, his voice laced with sarcasm as he extended his hand toward Taiga for a handshake, “I’m a fan of your works, Kyomoto-san,” he added heavily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he had expected, Taiga didn’t refuse. Hokuto tried to match Taiga’s calculating stare while they shook hands; the same hand that he used to hold and kiss felt disconnected from his grasp, as he shook off memories that tried to resurface.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Matsumura-san.”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Snow started to fall as they left Nagano, Taiga could finally relax after a stifling late lunch he had to endure. How could the world be so small? He was earlier convinced that fate was helping him to get Kouchi, but now he thought otherwise, fate wanted to make fun of a greedy businessman like him by meeting Hokuto again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto, who’d not only gotten more handsome, his undeniable sex appeal was off the charts that it could tempt even a saint. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hokuto with his half-white boyfriend, Jesse,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Taiga mused. He used to think of different scenarios if he meets Hokuto again, but he could never have guessed that he would be the one left standing on the same ground. He knew he shouldn’t feel aggrieved, he’d been unfair to Hokuto, he broke up with him in the most unacceptable manner, and selfish as it might seem, he always hoped that if he met Hokuto again, both of them had moved on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have you booked me a flight tonight?” He asked his secretary, he had no intention of spending another day in Tokyo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Kyomoto-sama, I checked all the airlines, but they are fully booked. The earliest flight I could find would be tomorrow at 9 in the morning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga sighed. “Very well. Better than nothing.” He returned his attention to the gloomy skies outside. He should be rejoicing, because Kouchi finally agreed to invest in his company. He would even travel to New York by next week to sign the deal, but all Taiga could do was give fake smiles seeing how Hokuto and Jesse not only looked good together, they seemed really compatible as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“He looks happier…”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Abarero has replied to my email –”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell them it doesn't matter,” he cuts in. “They also don’t need to release an official statement as long as they take down all the articles, and prevent the picture from circulating further.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure, Kyomoto-sama? Their director wanted to meet you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Whatever for? Anyway, I’ll be gone tomorrow, there’s no need to make a fuss,” he said as the pilot announced that they would be landing in Tokyo soon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And there’s no need for their author to change their pseudonym, well, not yet anyway,” he added. He would explain everything to Kouchi later after the ink had dried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What just happened back there?” Jesse asked as soon as they settled into their seats. “How did you become my boyfriend and why did you let him go and pretend to be you as the author?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Relax,” Hokuto said calmly even though he was far from Zen. He’d been a nerve-wreck since meeting Taiga, and he couldn’t enjoy the sumptuous lunch ordered for them when Taiga was seated across from him. Time had been kind to his jerk of an ex-boyfriend. Taiga’s androgynous looks had gotten sharper, yet he still looked delicate and even ethereal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto!” Jesse called, breaking him out of his reverie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…where were we?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What were you thinking earlier?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah…yes,” he mumbled, scratching his eyebrows, “sorry for getting you caught off-guard, but I decided to test Kouchi.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How?” Jesse asked, still looking dubious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know what they say, envy is part of human nature, so I wanted to see if Kouchi would look envious that you have a boyfriend.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse’s eyes widened upon realizing his good intentions. “And what did you see?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto bit his lower lip, before saying politely, “He looked…he doesn’t really care much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse deflated on his seat. “That mean he is straight?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Quite hard to gauge. I mean, he might not be jealous, because he only sees you as a friend, but who knows what might change if you confess? Or maybe he’ll realize his feelings for you go beyond friendship when he gets to know you more?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So I have to make him fall deeper for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But how do I do that when he knows we’re dating? Wouldn’t that make me a man-whore?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought that’s what you want with your hairstyle?” Hokuto quipped and Jesse glared at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We can pretend to be dating for a while, then we break up. Badly. You will break up with me with just a LINE message, then you will block me everywhere, then I will learn you are no longer in Japan and you’ll be dating a popstar after just a month of a break-up, then…" He let out a deep breath, noticing that he was too unnecessarily aggravated, while Jesse is looking more and more scared of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then, you’re going to act all heartbroken and let him comfort you,” he finished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ooooh…” Jesse mumbled, still looking at him with concern. "I guess that method still works?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded even though he was also unsure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, what about Kyomoto Taiga? Why do you think he claimed to be you and why did you let him get away with it? And how did you arrive at that pen name in the first place? Do you know another Kyomoto Taiga?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto sighed. Jesse received a lot of bombs earlier, he might as well get this over with. “No, it’s him. I used his name as my pen name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse frowned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course, he doesn’t know the writer is me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse still looked so confused and asked, “So…does that mean you know him? Do you know each other? It didn’t look like earlier.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smirked. “We just didn’t know each other. We used to date.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eh?!” Jesse gasped all too loudly, prompting Hokuto to cover his mouth when passengers started looking at them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Small world,” Jesse whispered afterward. “So what do you plan to do now?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” he said with a shrug. “Knowing that coward, he is definitely looking for the earliest flight back to the US.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But what if he stays for a while?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He wouldn’t,” he insisted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But what if he stays for a while?” Jesse repeated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you trying to say?” He asked impatiently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You help me with Kouchi, I’ll help you with Kyomoto.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto frowned. “But why would I be needing your help about Taiga?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse grinned mischievously. “As you’ve said, jealousy is part of a human’s nature, and I think I saw bits of that earlier. He was practically shooting laser beams earlier with his eyes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re bluffing,” he said, ignoring how his heart almost skipped in joy with just a thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse scoffed. “Your ears are so red,” he teased as the train started moving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m allergic to sound waves produced by trains.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse guffawed, and Hokuto chose to ignore him as he gazed outside, snow starting to fall. He would treat it as a small victory if Taiga did get jealous of Jesse, not because he wanted to get his ex back, but because he wanted nothing but for Taiga to feel pain every time he saw him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just pain. </span>
