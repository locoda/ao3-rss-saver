    <h1>Six Degrees of Separation</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/goodcasting/pseuds/goodcasting">goodcasting</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Have you met someone, who also knows someone you know, and they also know someone you know? That's what Hokuto and Taiga learned, that despite their years of separation, they remained connected with the people that they know. But will these people help them to get back together? Or will they be a hindrance as old feelings resurfaced and new feelings sprouted?</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <blockquote>
  <p>“Men build too many walls and not enough bridges.”<br/>
― <span class="authorOrTitle">Joseph Fort Newton</span></p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>“...concerned with inequality: the changing, and sometimes unchanging, forms of global inequality, how they can be appropriately measured and how they are expressed in the international legal and regulatory architecture; within countries, how various forms of social discrimination and hierarchy affect economic processes and capitalist dynamics; how economic inequalities impact on and are affected by accumulation; the redistributive role of fiscal and monetary and financial policies; how power imbalances affect the world of work….”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“That was really enlightening, Mr. Kyomoto,” she said, and glanced at her phone, before looking back at him with regret. “I'm afraid we ran out of time, I really enjoyed this interview. I hope we could have round 2 of this amazing chat.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Likewise,” Taiga replied, thanking the interviewer profusely as they bid each other goodbye. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He normally doesn't use his lunch hour for work-related stuff, but the interviewer emailed him a list of amazing questions, he just couldn't say no. It was refreshing to do an interview that didn't involve questions involving his popstar ex-boyfriend. It had been two years since they broke up, but New York society would always remember him as that “ikemen” Japanese guy. Heck, most New Yorkers that weren’t weebs, didn't even know that word until The New Yorker used it for their article, and it even went on to become Oxford Dictionary's “Word of the Year”.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga sighed and sipped his tea, while he tried to ignore the two Asian women who kept glancing at his direction. People normally don't ask for his picture, after all, he was no celebrity, and it bothered him why they were giving him curious glances. A message from his secretary made him shift his attention. The investor they'd been courting for their newest business venture finally agreed to a meeting, but he had to go to Japan for it.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Uhm, excuse me.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga looked up and saw that the two women finally got the courage to approach him. Based on their cute familiar accents, they were definitely Japanese.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Yes, how may I help you?” He asked, thinking that they might be tourists with limited English skills and that they needed his help as another Japanese person.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Sorry, we didn't mean to eavesdrop, but we overheard that your name is Kyomoto Taiga?”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga nodded, the woman could certainly speak passable English to be needing his help.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are you Kyomoto Taiga -- the author?” Asked the other woman.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Hmmm,  I wouldn't really call myself an author,” he said meekly. He has co-authored two business books, and even did an English-to-Japanese translation, does that qualify as being an author?</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>The women didn't seem to notice his puzzlement as they both squealed in delight.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“We are huge fans of your work!” They said in unison and several heads turned in their direction. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Really?” He clarified, confused. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I love ‘The Maid in the Attic’,” gushed one of them.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“My favorite is the 'Nights with the Devouring Dame' series,” said the other, her cheeks turning to a deeper shade of pink.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“And we both became fans because of 'Blooming Bud Lessons'!" </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga fought to maintain a straight face. He had no idea what they were talking about, and they clearly mistook him for someone else. Other customers glanced maliciously at him, and it was easy to tell why, the titles they mentioned reeked of R-18.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“We just want to thank you for representing us, even though you're a guy,” she added.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Yeah, there's not much <em> yuri </em> in the market.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Taiga almost choked on his tea. Not only was he mistaken for an R-18 author, but apparently, he also wrote Yuri.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He wanted to deny it so badly. There was no way he would want to be associated with such stories, but seeing the expectant look on the ladies' faces, he didn't want to embarrass them for being wrong. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He sighed and said with gritted teeth, “Thank you for reading my works.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>***</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Do you know what’s my favorite part of being an author? It’s when my haters curse me. There’s something so rewarding when my haters say, ‘You’re a piece of trash, Kyomoto Taiga!’.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro shook his head as Hokuto’s evil laughter filled the room. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are you a masochist? Of all the pen names, why use your ex’s name?”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Masochist? I’m a sadist and I want nothing but to inflict pain on that person,” Hokuto muttered, snapping his chopsticks into two. “So, no! There’s no way I would change my pen name even if you say that it brings me bad luck!” He finished with determination and fed himself with beef short ribs. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>He knew there would be bad news when Shintaro told him that he would be treating him to a high-end beef barbeque. After all, Shintaro is a cheapskate, and for him to treat someone meant that a huge favor would be asked.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Then, please wrap up your current work nicely,” Shintaro said, still grilling meat and not eating, “it’s expected for readership to drop once paid chapters are up, but for your current work, it didn’t just drop in half, it dropped in less than a quarter.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“That bad?” Hokuto asked, still a bit baffled. He was never really concerned with sales from doing these web-style comics, in fact, 90% of his earnings were passed to his illustrators. His day job as a hairstylist was enough for him to live comfortably, given his celebrity and affluent clientele. It might be quite narcissistic of him, but he didn’t get how his current work could be this unpopular, not only it was well-researched, his current comic is his most mature and realistic work to date. Shintaro was right, a lot of his works were written simply for fun, take his “The Maid in the Attic” for example, none of his readers even questioned why someone who lives in the attic would be needing her own maid.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Are the homophobes out to get me again?” He added. Lots of anti-LGBTQ loved to leave the nastiest comments on his Yuri comics. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro shook his head. “I told you this before, your readers are into your works because they were fun and unserious, with a bit of angst here and there, but the humor is always there. When you decided to have mature characters dealing with mature topics of a relationship, your readers just reduced.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Basically, you’re saying my readers are immature and didn’t want to deal with real-life issues of same-sex relationships,” Hokuto concluded. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I’m not saying that,” Shintaro countered. “But let’s get real, life is tough enough, I’m sure your readers just want to laugh instead of cry at the end of the day.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto nodded. He understood Shintaro's point, for the same reason that he avoided watching or reading anything <em> Yaoi </em>, it made him a bit uncomfortable seeing the sort of life he’d been living. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Very well, my editor,” he said, grinning. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“By the way, another reason I asked you to change your pen name was that someone, who introduced themself as your ex’s secretary, called our Abarero Agency.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto almost choked on the lettuce-wrapped beef ribs, before he descended into a coughing fit. “Shouldn’t you have told me this beforehand? W-what do they want?” He asked when he recovered. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“They were asking who was using the name Kyomoto Taiga.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Did you rat me out?” He asked, his eyes widening. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Of course not, we are not contractually obligated to reveal your real identity unless court-ordered.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto let out a sigh of relief. How did that jerk know about him anyway? “Good.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I know you’ve refused, but you might want to consider changing your pseudonym before they bring this to court.” </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Hokuto scoffed. “Who does he think he is? Is he the only Kyomoto Taiga in the whole of Japan? He might as well sue anyone who shares his name!” He argued with bravado. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Apparently, they checked. There were only 3 Kyomoto Taiga and the <em> kanjis </em> were different.”</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“I don’t give a shit,” he insisted, rolling his eyes, “I’m going to keep his name and have my haters curse him on my behalf,” he added, raising his middle finger.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>Shintaro sighed. “Don’t tell me I didn’t warn you,” Shintaro said, raising his all-free beer.</p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“Thank you, but I’ll be fine,” he said, clinking his own beer can. As far as he knew, Taiga wasn’t even in Japan, and even if he is, Hokuto didn’t care. </p><p>
  <span class="authorOrTitle"> </span>
</p><p>“The son of a bitch broke up with me with just a LINE message, he would never have the courage to face me,” Hokuto finished with bitterness, before drinking his beer straight. </p><p>
