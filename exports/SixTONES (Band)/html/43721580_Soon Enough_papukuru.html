      <p>"... Jesse… Hey..."</p><p>"Cheer up…"</p><p>Jesse kept his body laid over the cafeteria table as Juri shook his shoulders.</p><p>"You can't sulk forever, come on."</p><p>Jesse groaned, rolling his head away from Juri to hide his face in his other arm.</p><p>"I can and I will."</p><p>Taiga sighed as he took a bite from his lunch. "I warned you, didn't I? I knew you shouldn't have gotten so excited. You should have asked him first."</p><p>"What's the point of it being a surprise if I ask him beforehand?" Jesse whined into the table. "It wouldn't be a surprise at all!"</p><p>Taiga just shrugged to himself as he continued his lunch. "You could have at least asked if he was free…" </p><p>"I just didn't think Kochi was going to reject so blatantly," Shintaro chuckled, trying to lighten the mood but only managing to dig the knife deeper into Jesse's side.</p><p>On the 20th, Jesse had proudly handed Kochi an envelope, prompting him with nothing but "open it" and a smile.</p><p>Kochi had told him to make his move.</p><p>So he did.</p><p>He tried.</p><p>He planned a whole Christmas trip for the two of them with enthusiasm.</p><p>He found a resort. He booked their tickets. He planned their meals. He even planned their walk. He planned it down to the second where he hoped they would kiss under the Christmas starlight decorations without a soul in sight to ruin their moment.</p><p>Jesse was so excited, he wouldn't stop talking about it, raving about his glimmering and gleaming image of what would happen on the 25th to the point where even Juri was going to bed first, throwing his pillow across the room to shut his roommate up. </p><p>Everything was supposed to be perfect. </p><p>And it was. </p><p>Until the moment Kochi opened up the envelope, squinting at the dates of the tickets and returning it to Jesse with "I'm sorry."</p><p>It didn't help that the sting of the rejection only worsened when the other 4 pretended they didn't see anything once he returned to their table in the bar with the envelope still in hand.</p><p>Now the envelope just laid uselessly on his dorm room desk.</p><p>"Why don't you just help him at the bar during Christmas? Won't you at least be spending time with him?" Hokuto asked, returning to his seat beside Taiga after putting away his tray.</p><p>Jesse turned his head, resting it on his arm as he finally showed his face, releasing a deep sigh.</p><p>"No… I already promised my mom I'd come home for Christmas… With my dad being American and all that, it's actually kind of a big deal if I don't have any other plans."</p><p>They all gave a sympathetic hum, out of ideas and words to ease Jesse's regret as Juri smoothly changed the subject, leaving Jesse to continue sulking.</p><p>"Well, I'm going back to see my family. You are too, right Shintaro?"</p><p>Shintaro nodded, finishing off the rest of his bowl. "Mhm. We like to spend it together. Thankfully, it's not too far. Did you get your 4 brothers presents already?"</p><p>Juri plopped his chin in his palm, looking over to the person beside him. "Yes and no, we usually just pass each other money and call it good. How about you?"</p><p>"No presents," Shintaro chuckled as he traded his empty bowl for his glass of water. "Just some things for the puppies."</p><p>"Ohh nice. I'm sure they'll be happy." Juri returned his usual lazy smile before looking to the other side of the table.</p><p>"What about you, Kyomo?"</p><p>For some reason, Taiga sounded nervous as he set down his chopsticks.</p><p>"Ahh, uh my parents decided to go to Hawaii for the holidays."</p><p>"Oh! When are you leaving?"</p><p>"They left last week."</p><p>"You're not going?"</p><p>"Uhh… No…"</p><p>Juri raised a brow.</p><p>"You're staying home alone?"</p><p>Jesse didn't like the silence that followed. He knew that Taiga was just trying to be nice, but the drawn out pause just made it more painful.</p><p>Thankfully Hokuto pulled the trigger, mercifully putting Jesse out of his misery.</p><p>"He's staying with my family."</p><p>"My parents wanted to see him again anyways."</p><p>Shintaro gasped and shook Taiga's arm, jostling the other in his seat. </p><p>"You met his family???"</p><p>"Yeah, I did! Cut it out!" Taiga huffed as he tore off Shintaro's grasp. "It's just convenient… If I had gone with my parents, I would have missed weeks of school."</p><p>Taiga quickly reached past Hokuto to shake Jesse's arm. "It just happened to work out this way, okay? Don't feel bad…"</p><p>If Jesse could have melted into the table, he would have.</p><p>He just wanted to spend Christmas with Kochi.</p><p>It didn't feel like that was such a big ask.</p><p>He really did love to see his friends happy. It just sucked when it had been so long and they had moved nowhere.</p><p>Jesse was pretty sure Kochi liked him. </p><p>At least from what Taiga told him and how Kochi spoiled him, it seemed like he did. But even after he tried to take steps forward as he was told, Kochi took steps back. </p><p>He couldn't figure out what it was.</p><p>Maybe it was him but maybe Kochi still lived by his words.</p><p>Kochi just wasn't looking for a relationship right now.</p><h6></h6><p>Jesse let out a deep breath as he stared at the ceiling of his childhood home, laying spread out on his bed that was a touch too small now, but was just as comfortable as it was when he was 10.</p><p>Christmas was almost over.</p><p>Approximately 1 hour and 8 minutes away from being over.</p><p>His stomach was full of his mom's food and his heart was brimming with his family's love.</p><p>It was fun. He enjoyed laughing and playing games with his sister as he cracked jokes with his dad. The Christmas dinner his mom made was delicious as always as she placed more servings onto his plate.</p><p>Jesse really did love spending time with his family. </p><p>But he couldn't help but wish that his original plans would have panned out.</p><p>He knew he couldn't brood over it forever but… he really just hoped this would have been his chance.</p><p>Of course, Hokuto had gone through hell and things with Kochi had been considerably less painful than his experience, but if Hokuto's relationship with Taiga was a slow burn, then things with Kochi were barely a smolder.</p><p>Jesse just wanted to add some gas to the fire. </p><p>But instead, it felt like he added a bucket of water.</p><p>He groaned as he rolled onto his side, reaching out to gather his phone on his side table to open up and reread the exchange of messages in their group chat from earlier.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Shintaro:<br/><em>Merikuri!!!</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Shintaro:<br/><em>Merikuri from Chii-chan too :)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Attached was a photo of Shintaro, grinning ear to ear with a large fluffy dog looped under his arm.</p><p>The dog also looked happy with a still tagged plush toy in its mouth.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em>merikuri~</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Juri sent a sticker of a Santa celebrating, contrasting his bland response.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Hokuto:<br/><em>Merry Christmas!</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse:<br/><em>Merry Christmas guys!! Any presents?? Photos plz if you do</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em>mom got me a watch</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The photo was just of Juri's arm. It was blurry, but you could still see a silver watch on his thin wrist.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse:<br/><em>looks sick!</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse: <br/><em>I think</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em>ww ty</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Shintaro sent a sticker of a character rolling and laughing.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga: <br/><em>Happy Christmas!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga's message was followed by an emoji of a baked chicken.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga:<br/><em>I got a bottle of sake from Hokuto's mom.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>From the photo, the sake seemed to be locally produced with its simplistic but hand designed label.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Shintaro:<br/><em>Okay, but what did Hokuto get you?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>It was obvious that Shintaro was eager to pick on the rather private couple.</p><p>At this point, if they hadn't been Jesse's closest friends, he would have shut off his phone and ignored it until tomorrow, but he had stayed engaged with the chatter.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga:<br/><em>This.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The pajama set in Taiga's lap looked soft.</p><p>At this time of night Taiga was probably wearing it now, sleeping peacefully next to his boyfriend.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em>lame</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Hokuto:<br/><em>Shut up.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Hokuto:<br/><em>Jess, what did you get?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Jesse had sent a photo of his small cluster of gifts his parents and sister gave him.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Juri:<br/><em>dang a brand name wallet??</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse: <br/><em>My dad helped my sister get it for me</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse: <br/><em>She knew I had been eyeing it for a while</em></p>
</blockquote><p>As they talked spiritedly, people coming in and out of the conversation as they discussed what they ate and what they received, along with a short argument about whether Hokuto would actually wear the scarf Taiga gave him, there wasn't one response from Kochi.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Shintaro:<br/><em>?? Nothing from Kochi yet?</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga: <br/><em>The bar can get pretty crowded on Christmas.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga: <br/><em>He serves a lot of people who aren't welcome home anymore.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Taiga: <br/><em>I'm sure he's just busy.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Those messages had been sent around 3 hours ago and there was still no reply.</p><p>Jesse had even sent him a message privately with a sticker saying merry christmas, but only got the note next to his text that said "read".</p><p>There was a pang of guilt in Jesse's chest when Taiga mentioned Kochi's work, feeling that he should have stayed there to help, but it was Kochi himself who insisted that he return home.</p><p>He knew he shouldn't feel bad, but the thought of an overworked Kochi still made him feel regretful.</p><p>Jesse sighed as he dropped his phone and laid on his back, placing his hands together in a prayer towards the ceiling.</p><p>"Dear…… Santa."</p><p>"It's a little late, but all I want this Christmas is to see Kochi Yugo at least once."</p><p>"Please."</p><p>"I promise to give you a beer afterwards."</p><p>"Or something."</p><p>He laughed to himself as he began to joke around, dropping his hands onto his chest and muttering in a half hearted playful tune "Just kidding..."</p><p>Jesse sighed again. </p><p>Just a bit longer…</p><p>He couldn't be far from winning him over, right?</p><p>Even if he wasn't, he was ready to do everything he could to ensure it.</p><p>He knew Kochi liked him, so it wasn't like he was forcing himself on him.</p><p>He just had to wait a bit longer until Kochi was ready.</p><p>Hopefully next Christmas, they could spend it together.</p><p>Jesse closed his eyes, ready to fall asleep. </p><p>Tomorrow would be just another day and another step forward, he hoped.</p><p>Maybe, he could offer to take over the bar for a day so Kochi could rest…</p><p>…</p><p>Jesse's eyes shot open when his phone pinged.</p><p>He didn't even know who it was, but he scrambled for his phone, rolling onto his stomach to lean over it and see what the notification was for. </p><p>Jesse read the message out loud.</p><p>"... Christmas may be over but the deals haven't-..."</p><p>Jesse's arms collapsed from under him, dropping his forehead onto his screen as he buried his face into his sheets.</p><p>If his sister's room wasn't next to him he would have exhaled a loud groan.</p><p>It was just a stupid email advertising their after holiday sale.</p><p>Why was he getting all excited?...</p><p>Kochi was probably already asleep.</p><p>There was no way he would-</p><p>His phone rattled against his skull.</p><p>Blurry eyed, Jesse raised his head to look at the message that glowed on the screen.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Kochi:<br/><em>Merry Christmas</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Kochi:<br/><em>Are you awake?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Yes.</p><p>YES.</p><p>Jesse's hands almost shook as he unlocked his phone to answer.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse:<br/><em>Yes Im awake</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Kochi: <br/><em>Do you have a minute?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A minute. An hour. A day. A lifetime. Jesse had all the time in the world if it was for him.</p><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse: <br/><em>Yeah</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Jesse:<br/><em>Whats up?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>His phone began to ring with a call.</p><p>Jesse didn't know if he had ever pressed a button any faster.</p><p>"Hello?..."</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Kochi's voice sounded soft.</p><p>It wasn't unusual, but it still made Jesse's stomach turn with concern.</p><p>"Hey… Everything alright?"</p><p>"Yeah, everything is fine."</p><p>"I uh… I just wanted to apologize for not being responsive."</p><p>Jesse sat up, adjusting himself to lean against the headboard of his bed as he listened with his phone still pressed against his ear </p><p>"No, it's no problem at all, Taiga said you would be busy… You must be tired."</p><p>Jesse fell in love with Kochi's laugh the first time he heard it and fell in love with it every time after, even when it was gentle and quiet over the phone.</p><p>"It was busy, but I'm alright. It's nothing I haven't done before, but I have to admit, I felt a little spoiled having you around… It's been a while since I've worked a busy night alone."</p><p>The way Jesse's hand tightened around his phone mirrored the squeeze in his heart as Kochi spoke.</p><p>He should have stayed…</p><p>"I'm sorry. I should have helped-"</p><p>"No, it's okay. Your family is more important."</p><p>"But what about yours? </p><p>"It's fine. I'm planning on seeing them next week for new years."</p><p>"... Then let me help this week."</p><p>"Shouldn't you be relaxing?"</p><p>"I want to help."</p><p>I want to see you.</p><p>Was what Jesse really wanted to say but cowardness was so much easier.</p><p>Jesse could see his smile as Kochi laughed. </p><p>"Alright. I look forward to it then."</p><p>The call fell quiet for a moment as Jesse fought himself for what to say, hearing what he thought sounded like a breeze on the other's phone.</p><p>But before Jesse could find the right words, Kochi spoke first.</p><p>"Hey… Can I be a little selfish?..."</p><p>Jesse nodded, crossing his legs as he replied.</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"... I want to see you."</p><p>Jesse's heart could have exploded.</p><p>He almost thought he was dreaming.</p><p>Kochi never said anything like this.</p><p>He nearly asked for him to repeat himself as Kochi talked over him.</p><p>"Are you able to come outside?"</p><p>All Kochi heard in response was a distant thud and clatter followed by a muffled groan.</p><p>"... Jesse?"</p><p>The phone clattered again as Jesse recovered it from the floor, rubbing at his throbbing knee that had collided into the ground after he had tripped and fallen off his bed.</p><p>"Yeah- Just hold on-"</p><p>Jesse found whatever sweatpants he could find, shoving his legs into them over his pajamas before taking whatever coat he had to zip up to his neck and swiftly, but quietly, sped to the front door.</p><p>When he swung open the door, panting and out of breath, he wasn't sure what he would find. </p><p>It all didn't feel quite real as he stood there, white puffs leaving his lips with his phone still pressed against his ear as he watched Kochi look over to him with his phone still at his lips.</p><p>Kochi was really there, waiting in his thick leather winter jacket as he leaned against his motorbike.</p><p>His helmet was hung up on the handlebar as the bike sat parked on the street outside of Jesse's family home.</p><p>When Kochi smiled and spoke, his voice from his lips layering with his voice from Jesse's phone.</p><p>"Hi."</p><p>Jesse walked towards him, eyes wide with amazement as Kochi hung up the call.</p><p>"... How-"</p><p>"I asked Juri for your address. That guy really does have loose lips."</p><p>Jesse just watched the stream of white that came from Kochi's lips as he chuckled and pushed his phone back into the pocket of his jacket.</p><p>His heart was pounding in his ears.</p><p>"Come here."</p><p>Jesse obeyed without question, approaching Kochi as he held out his hands, the tips of his fingers pink from the winter chill.</p><p>"They're cold."</p><p>It didn't even take a second before Jesse wrapped his hands around Kochi's, heating his icey skin in his warm palms.</p><p>They both watched their hands as Jesse shared his warmth, the temperature of their skin slowly coming to match as the cold left Kochi's fingers. They stayed in the comfortable quiet, the streets empty and the neighborhood around them asleep, leaving what felt like the world just for them.</p><p>Kochi spoke softly, not wanting to break the silence as Jesse shifted their hold, heating Kochi's neglected palm and thumbs.</p><p>"... I'm sorry I didn't say anything…"</p><p>Jesse shook his head, squeezing Kochi's hands in his.</p><p>"No. No, it's okay…"</p><p>"I-... I'm really happy you're here…"</p><p>Kochi smiled to himself as he squeezed back.</p><p>"I also want to apologize for something else."</p><p>Jesse was hesitant as he looked up, seeing Kochi's eyes still lowered as he spoke.</p><p>"... I know you've been waiting and I know I've been keeping you waiting… and that's not fair to you."</p><p>"I told you I wasn't interested in dating and that wasn't a lie… I was so caught up in Taiga's worries and my work, I hardly had time to think about anything else."</p><p>Kochi shifted his feet.</p><p>"People say I'm kind but-"</p><p>Jesse cut in.</p><p>"You are-!"</p><p>Kochi spoke over him. </p><p>"I'm not."</p><p>Both of them let out a quiet sigh, Kochi's ending with a soft smile as his fingers tightened around Jesse's hands.</p><p>"If I was kind, I would have let you go months ago."</p><p>"But I didn't."</p><p>"I kept stringing you along without an answer."</p><p>Jesse clenched his jaw.</p><p>He wanted to say Kochi was wrong, that he did nothing bad but he knew Kochi wouldn't take any of that as an answer.</p><p>Kochi continued.</p><p>"I should have said no and let you move on to someone who could answer you with confidence instead of just keeping you around to boost my own ego."</p><p>"But… you know-..."</p><p>Kochi let go of Jesse's hands to spread them flat against his, holding their palms together.</p><p>Slowly, he interlaced his fingers with Jesse's as Jesse just watched him in silence with his heart ready to burst from his chest.</p><p>"I… missed you today…"</p><p>"I didn't realize how much I had grown used to you being around… I found myself looking for you when you weren't there…"</p><p>"So, I guess what I wanted to say was if it's not too late-"</p><p>When Kochi looked up at him, Jesse didn't know he was already leaning in.</p><p>It was like he was locked in a trance as Kochi's fingers fell from their hold to spread out smoothly against his chest. Their cheeks brushed as Kochi's chin raised.</p><p>If the winter hadn't chilled it, he wasn't sure if he would have ever felt Kochi's lips against his cheek if they hadn't been so warm on his cold skin.</p><p>Even the breath Kochi whispered felt hot against his ear.</p><p>"Merry Christmas, Jesse."</p><p>It didn't matter.</p><p>It didn't matter that it was 10 minutes past midnight.</p><p>Jesse was breathless. </p><p>He couldn't even bring himself to move after Kochi set his forehead on his shoulder.</p><p>He had never been this close to him before.</p><p>Sure, there were moments where they would bump shoulders in passing or reach around each other to grab what they needed from behind the bar, but never like this.</p><p>It had never been intimate like this.</p><p>"I'm sorry I couldn't go on your trip."</p><p>"But all I want from you this Christmas is just for you to wait a bit longer."</p><p>Jesse fought the words out of his mouth as his throat croaked.</p><p>"How much longer-?"</p><p>Kochi idly ran his fingers along the edge of the zipper of Jesse's coat as he bit back his laugh.</p><p>"I don't know, I can't promise-"</p><p>When Jesse grabbed his shoulders to push him back, Kochi nearly jolted as he kept himself steady against his bike, locking eyes with Jesse's determined gaze.</p><p>"Then by my birthday."</p><p>Kochi stammered, thrown off by Jesse's sudden fire.</p><p>"H-huh?"</p><p>Kochi blinked as Jesse's grip tightened on his arms.</p><p>"I'll make you fall in love with me by my birthday."</p><p>It had been a while.</p><p>Kochi couldn't even remember the last time it happened.</p><p>It must have been forever ago since his heart had skipped like this.</p><p>All Kochi could do was laugh as his cheeks grew warm.</p><p>"What the hell… What are you even saying?"</p><p>Jesse held back his frown.</p><p>"I'm serious. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do whatever it takes next year."</p><p>Kochi pushed Jesse away by his chest with laughter still on his lips as his eyes dropped away from Jesse's. "Stop messing around."</p><p>The push made Jesse step back, but he moved right back in. </p><p>"I mean it. I'll start now. I swear by my birthday, I'll have you fall in love with me."</p><p>Kochi smiled, crossing his legs as he pushed his hands into his coat pockets.</p><p>"Really? How are you going to do that?" </p><p>"Like this."</p><p>Jesse's body moved by instinct.</p><p>He gave himself no time to consider if it would be a mistake. </p><p>But as he took Kochi's cheek, bringing their eyes to meet again, he knew that it was about time for him to act as the man Kochi told him to be.</p><p>Kochi's breath hitched as their lips met, the touch warm after he had been chilled by the evening breeze.</p><p>It was gentle and brief, but the way Jesse sighed into the kiss told Kochi that he had been waiting forever for this moment, regardless of how momentary it was. </p><p>As Jesse pulled away and Kochi's eyes fluttered open, the burst of bravery left Jesse's chest as his ears began to burn red.</p><p>He covered his face with the back of his hand, trying to keep his voice sounding confident in his speech </p><p>"I-I'll take that as your Christmas present this year, so next year-"</p><p>"Alright, I got it."</p><p>When Jesse looked over his hand, he saw Kochi kicking up the stand of his bike as he mounted it.</p><p>"Huh-? W-wait-" </p><p>Jesse held the handle of the bike as if it would delay Kochi's exit as unhooked his helmet from the bar.</p><p>"It's late- Why don't you stay-"</p><p>The bike roared to life as Kochi tugged on his gloves.</p><p>"I have to go. There's things I have to take care of at home."</p><p>Jesse sighed, defeated as his hand slipped from the bike, destined to watch Kochi leave him once again.</p><p>But before he could get any more disheartened, the tap of Kochi's knuckles under his chin made him wince and raise his head back up to the other to see his smile.</p><p>"You should get some sleep too."</p><p>"After all, you need all the energy you can get if you want a chance to kiss me like that again."</p><p>The way Jesse stammered and struggled to find a response made Kochi laugh as he placed and clipped on his helmet.</p><p>"Merry Christmas, Jesse."</p><p>The bike revved again. </p><p>"I look forward to falling in love with you."</p><p>That did it.</p><p>That made Jesse completely malfunction.</p><p>He froze in stunned silence as Kochi gave his cheek a gentle pat before driving away, Jesse's eyes watching the other fade into the dark night before his face dyed scarlet.</p><p>By the time he got his sputtering brain to work well enough to reach his bed, he curled under his blanket, still dressed in his winter clothing as his body felt hotter than it had been during mid-summer.</p><p>He touched his knuckles to the back of his lips, trying to memorize the touch until he could have it next as his mind was already crafting scenes of Kochi professing his love to him for his dreams.</p><p>He will do it.</p><p>By his birthday, he will absolutely make Kochi fall in love with him. </p><p>He’ll be sure of it. </p><p>In 6 months, Jesse was absolutely sure that Kochi will be his boyfriend. </p><p>As Jesse fell asleep, Kochi drove home on his bike, smiling as the winter breeze brushed his skin and filled his lungs.</p><p>He had made a brash decision coming here.</p><p>The whole time he drove over, he wondered if he should turn back and just wait patiently for when the tall boy would appear before him again.</p><p>But something kept pushing him forward. </p><p>Maybe it was just how much he had missed him working Christmas night alone or maybe it was the photo Taiga had sent him of Jesse laying defeated over the cafeteria table. </p><p>Well, it wasn't really important now.</p><p>He had said more than the "Merry Christmas" he had intended.</p><p>"By June, huh?"</p><p>Kochi laughed to himself as the wind whipped past him.</p><p>June 11th was the due date. </p><p>"I guess I'll tell him then that I'm already in love with him."</p>

I did in fact make With You a series haha. I just couldn't bring myself to add this as another chapter, but I think if I ever finish the alternate ending to With You, it will also go into this series! since I don't want it to exists as part of the whole fic haha. </p><p>Koimaji will most likely come out next week... I'm sorry it will be so late. With the holidays, I won't have much time to work on it, so I hope everyone can be patient with me! </p><p>I would love to hear comments!! This is only my second Yugoje so I'm not really sure how it is! I'd like to hear what people think haha! I love an appreciate all feed back!!</p><p>If you would like fic updates or have previews of other things and works, please feel free to follow my twitter!
