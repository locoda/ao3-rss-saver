<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>After attempting to write two other fics, this AU is what I came up with for our silly shiritori game my friends and I are running! The starting word given to me was "morning". This whole piece is actually heavily inspired by a real-life Tinder story I heard on one of the podcasts I listen to and I thought it was hilarious lmao.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Morning, listeners! Welcome to <em>Tanaka no Teppei</em>, where nothing's off-limits, and we're diving deep into everything. Get ready for the hottest, most brutal, sexiest, and most beloved gay podcast around!" Juri's voice booms through the microphone as he adjusts himself in his chair.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow, do you always use that same greeting?" Taiga's laconic voice asks him.</p><p> </p><p>"And today, as you can hear, I have a special guest here!"</p><p> </p><p>"Very special," Taiga says. "I'm glad you also found your way here, Juri."</p><p> </p><p>"Well yeah, this is my podcast, can you imagine! Anyway, everyone, please welcome my friend Kyomo."</p><p> </p><p>Juri claps his hands near the microphone.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, it's nice to be here," Taiga says.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomo is actually that friend who's been asking about my manifestation."</p><p> </p><p>"Are we really diving into that topic right off the bat?" Taiga inquiries.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, this is how this podcast works! You probably never listen to these episodes, but I brought it up a few weeks ago that I've started manifestation. And just look at my life these past two weeks! It's been nothing short of perfect!" Juri exclaims with a grin plastered on his face. "I wish our listeners could see the joy radiating from me right now. Kyomo, can you describe my face for them?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, Juri's face looks too happy," Taiga deadpans, "I don't recognize this person. He's seriously been going on about that manifestation for the past weeks, no lies there. At first, I thought it was just nonsense, but then he told me that he had manifested a boyfriend for his friend after she complained she didn't have one."</p><p> </p><p>"Right. What else did I do?"</p><p> </p><p>"Our friend Shintaro was lamenting about not having enough money, so you manifested some for him. Then, that luxury camping tent that he was about to purchase was sold out so his plans were foiled, so he did end up saving some money after all."</p><p> </p><p>"See, it really worked!"</p><p> </p><p>"Then I reminded Juri to remember me too," Taiga goes on. "I went on reminding him that he has other friends too. I thought he could manifest a little something for me as well. Just something exciting for my boring week."</p><p> </p><p>"Yup, so I started doing that!"</p><p> </p><p>"You really did. Because right in the Thursday morning, I opened this app-that-we-shall-not-name—"</p><p> </p><p>"That's too nerdy, Kyomo. Keep Harry Potter references out of my podcast."</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, there was this one guy who I matched with, and he started talking to me. And we immediately went into the deep topic."</p><p> </p><p>"What topic?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sex. We went straight into it, no holding back," Taiga states with a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Juri chuckles. "Classic. So, how about telling the whole story for our listeners from the very start?"</p><p> </p><p>"So, he mentioned he's from Shizuoka and just visiting for a few days," Taiga starts. "I figured, why not? He's not local, so chances are I won't have to see him ever again—"</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>It was a perfect Tinder meeting planned, just all for shagging.</p><p> </p><p>If everything went terribly wrong, his match would be gone, and they wouldn't need to meet ever again. Perfect. And if everything went nicely, the guy would still be gone sooner rather than later, and they wouldn't need to meet again. Even more perfect. It truly was like a win-win situation.</p><p> </p><p>Once Taiga had finished his work day and returned home, he pulled out his phone from his bag and quickly sent the guy a message, asking when he wanted to meet up. The answer came quickly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I'm pretty flexible. The timing doesn't matter much to me because I'm excited to meet you anyway. Our conversation already seemed promising. You know how it is. Plus, the weather's nice, and it looks like it'll stay that way all evening, at least according to the forecast. Do you also get motivated by good weather, or is it just me?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>…okay. The weirdest kind of response, but whatever. Taiga could just invite him over right away.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>Well, how about right away then? You can come to my place.</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Great! I'm not too far from your location, actually. It'll probably only take me 15 minutes by bus, maybe less if I take a train. But I'll stick with the bus since it involves less walking. Walking is okay, but sometimes it's too time-consuming. My best friend doesn't like walking anywhere and always insists on taking a taxi if the walk takes more than 10 minutes. Just for your information, I don't have much time to spare since I have plans to meet a friend later tonight. I promised to have that meeting at six thirty.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't mind the limited time frame at all. In fact, it made the situation even more perfect. With the time constraint, there was no chance of this rambling guy overstaying his welcome, eliminating any need for awkward conversations about him leaving. An hour was all they needed - just enough time to do whatever they had planned, and then the guy would be gone.</p><p> </p><p>It was shaping up to be an ideal scenario.</p><p> </p><p>But then minutes ticked by. An hour. Taiga found himself nervously scanning the faces of each person stepping off the bus near his apartment, hoping to spot someone who even remotely resembled the guy from the dating app's profile picture. Yet, there was no sign of him. Taiga began to feel a bit uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>At one point, Taiga's phone made a notification sound, indicating another message from that Hokuto guy. It appeared that the guy had opted for the train after all but had ended up boarding the wrong one, heading in the opposite direction.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, nobody's perfect," Taiga thought as he threw the phone back on the coffee table. He could wait a bit more.</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga finally received the message that the guy was finally downstairs, he realized that they truly didn't have much time. With only about 15 minutes left before the guy would need to be in the next place, to be exact.</p><p> </p><p>"Well," Taiga thought to himself and tried to see the positive side of the situation as he let the guy in through the front door via the interphone, "maybe it'll still be okay as long as we get down to business as soon as he steps inside the apartment. Who has sex for more than 15 minutes anyway?"</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto entered Taiga's apartment, Taiga couldn't help but notice his striking appearance. He was undeniably good-looking, perhaps even more than his dating app profile pictures suggested.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto seemed a bit awkward as he removed his shoes, offering polite bows while not really knowing where to look. Being a few centimeters taller than Taiga, he possessed an attractive face with noteworthy details like a mole just above his plush lips and a straight nose, adding to his appeal.</p><p> </p><p>When Hokuto spoke, his voice had a low, soothing quality that made Taiga's knees go weak – although that could've also been the result of the general anticipation of getting down to business with absolutely anyone. Taiga really needed sex, and this one was such a good catch.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want some... water?" Taiga offered politely, though his mind was too busy waiting for something that was definitely not about hydration.</p><p> </p><p>Taking the first step had never been Taiga's forte, especially with such a weird awkwardness in the air. But he hoped this Hokuto guy would catch the hint.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto simply nodded in response, expressing his gratitude with a bashful smile as he glanced around Taiga's place. Taiga led him to the living room, feeling like a host on a particularly awkward game show. He gestured for Hokuto to settle onto the couch like a contestant waiting for their turn in the spotlight.</p><p> </p><p>Then Taiga hurried to the small kitchenette, fetching a glass of water.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto offered his thanks as Taiga hurried to the living room and handed out the glass to him. Their hands brushed.</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks for the water," Hokuto said as he gulped the water down and placed the glass on the table.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe he was ready now?</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's sexy voice was really making things inside Taiga's pants, and they didn't have too much time left.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sat down next to Hokuto on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>"So, you told me you don't have much time now," Taiga started slowly, hoping his impatient tone was implying enough.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Hokuto answered and then went on with a suggestive tone, "Can I ask you something?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a better position and was ready to take whatever would come out. Maybe Hokuto wanted to make sure if he preferred being top or bottom-</p><p> </p><p>"You have a nice apartment. Have you been living here for long?" Hokuto asked first.</p><p> </p><p>"I'd li-- What? Oh, about three years," Taiga stuttered, thrown off balance by the sudden change in direction. He shot Hokuto a questioning look, wondering where this conversation was going.</p><p> </p><p>"And how's the area, how do you feel about it?" Hokuto inquired, like a potential buyer discussing a property with a real estate agent.</p><p> </p><p>"It's fine."</p><p> </p><p>"How's work, how do you commute there every day?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga found himself in disbelief, feeling so stunned that he mechanically answered all the Hokuto's questions that kept coming and coming.</p><p> </p><p>He had expected a different kind of interaction entirely, maybe not even a conversation at all, since that was usually pretty pointless when it came to one-night stands—or one-day stands, in this case.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto continued to ask about Taiga's job and hobbies. When Taiga quickly mentioned his passion for photography, Hokuto's eyes lit up with interest. He started asking about Taiga's camera model and the things he enjoyed photographing.</p><p> </p><p>"So, do people still use film cameras?" Hokuto asked, and Taiga swore he was in a candid camera show.</p><p> </p><p>What was with this weird guy? Couldn't he just get to the point and do something? Taiga surely hadn't invited him over just to chat. As far as he was concerned, Hokuto was there to fuck him, and that's it. That's what they had been discussing very straightforwardly the whole morning.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga inched closer to Hokuto, hoping the guy would finally catch on that it was time to make a move.</p><p> </p><p>Yet, Hokuto simply continued rambling on, oblivious to Taiga's suggestive movement. He talked, talked, and talked. Taiga no longer bothered to react to anything that Hokuto said. But even that didn't seem to slow Hokuto's rambling down.</p><p> </p><p>Finally reaching his limit, Taiga decided to take matters into his own hands.</p><p> </p><p>He gently placed his hand on Hokuto's cheek, turning his head, and silenced him by pressing his lips against his.</p><p> </p><p>As their mouths met, Hokuto was rendered speechless, unable to talk with Taiga's mouth firmly pressed against his own. Taiga deepened the kiss, parting Hokuto's lips with his tongue, which Hokuto eagerly answered.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, at last, there was less nonsense talking and more kissing. Just as Taiga had hoped for.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's actions became immediately more assertive as he pushed Taiga down onto the couch, positioning himself on top. He began tearing off Taiga's clothes, swiftly unbuttoning his outer shirt and pulling it open before yanking his t-shirt over his head. Hokuto then proceeded to slide Taiga's pants down, revealing more of his bare skin beneath.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga attempted to take off Hokuto's green cardigan by sliding it off his shoulder, but Hokuto grabbed Taiga's wrists and held them firmly in his hands. He then kissed Taiga deeply once more, preventing any further attempts to undress him.</p><p> </p><p>They continued kissing until Taiga's wrists were released, and he shifted his hands between them, attempting to open Hokuto's belt.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm, I'm a bit busy—" Hokuto mumbled, but Taiga interrupted him by pressing his lips against his mouth, kissing him deeply again.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't care," Taiga panted against his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could afford to be five minutes late for his meeting but it was Taiga who couldn't afford waiting any longer. He wanted Hokuto's dick in his mouth or inside his ass, and he was about to command him to make it happen right away, right there.</p><p> </p><p>But Hokuto led Taiga's hands away from his belt.</p><p> </p><p>Then Hokuto abruptly broke the kiss, shifted position, and swiftly removed Taiga's boxers. Taiga was now completely naked while Hokuto remained fully dressed, but before Taiga could dwell on it, Hokuto's warm mouth came to his dick.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga made an effort to focus on the feeling of Hokuto's mouth on him, although it did feel a bit odd being all naked while Hokuto had all his clothes on. However, Taiga quickly rationalized that it was okay. He had been in similar situations before, where he had taken care of someone else and simply enjoyed the nice scene before him. So, he accepted it as it was and tried to enjoy feeling the incredible hotness around him. Maybe the universe was just giving him something back after those previous experiences where he hadn't been the receiver.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto kept sucking Taiga's dick, focusing on the head while his hands gently played with Taiga's balls, intensifying the pleasure. His fingers were brushing the skin near Taiga's hole, and Taiga felt he was coming closer-</p><p> </p><p>Then Hokuto's movements came to a halt, and he withdrew his mouth from Taiga's cock. Taiga opened his eyes and lifted his head, a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p> </p><p>But before Taiga could say anything, Hokuto had already gotten up and walked to the foyer.</p><p> </p><p>"W-what?" Taiga asked, watching in disbelief as Hokuto started putting on his shoes.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, I have to leave now. I'd be really embarrassed if I were late for that meeting," Hokuto explained. "I couldn't do that to my friend."</p><p> </p><p><i>'Well, how can you do this to my friend and leave them hanging like this then?!'</i> Juri <i>would</i> shout for sure. Taiga wanted to yell and ask that exact question, but he was too shocked by this weird guy's bizarre behavior that he could only gape in disbelief, unable to find his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto opened the front door. "Catch you later, Kyomoto!" he called out before shutting the door behind him.</p><p> </p><p>"…catch you later."</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>"HE DIDN'T," Juri shouts into the microphone, his voice loud enough to make Taiga cringe, knowing they'd likely need to edit that out for the sake of their listeners' ears.</p><p> </p><p>"He unfortunately did," Taiga responds with a defeated tone. Now the whole sad story was out there for all of Juri's podcast listeners to hear.</p><p> </p><p>"So, what was the catch? He didn't like your dick or something?" Juri asks bluntly.</p><p> </p><p>"Who knows," Taiga shrugs. "We didn't really talk about it."</p><p> </p><p>"Wait wait wait," Juri interjects excitedly. "But there wasn't complete radio silence afterwards, was there?"</p><p> </p><p>"No. I sent him a message and asked if he made it to his meeting on time," Taiga says.</p><p> </p><p>"And then what?" Juri prompts.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing. He just said he did and talked about something completely nonsensical again. That's it. That's the story," Taiga replies with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, Kyomo, looks like my manifestation didn't quite... go the distance, as they say." Juri scratches his head.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, only halfway. Literally," Taiga agrees.</p><p> </p><p>"But it's a good starting point! And still a memorable experience overall!" Juri tries to spin it positively.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess. Can you just promise not to do that ever again? No more manifestation, please."</p>
