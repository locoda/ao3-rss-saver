<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">My name is Kochi Yugo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I turned 30 today. A milestone, in a way. Supposedly the peak of my life and my adulthood.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unfortunately, I’m just a (sad) accountant for S Company. Ever since I graduated university, my daily life consisted of working, attending drinking parties against my will and… sleep. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nothing much, in sum. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I’m never motivated to do much, it is like a cycle that never stops.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I’m always too tired to go out but I’m also too sleepy to give it my all at work. It was a peaceful life in a way.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But after turning 30, my life turned into a literal storm of thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “Ha, I’m hungry today. I wonder what to get for lunch.” </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “I’m going to be late for work!” </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “Hmm, morning again… can’t wait to go back home and jack off to my favorite por–” </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I might have grimaced unconsciously at that last thought – mind you, these aren’t my thoughts! These are thoughts of the people bumping into me in the crowded subway on my way to work. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The crowd sticking to me aside, these thoughts swirling around me is like being hit by an icy storm, prickling my skin and my brain.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It’s painful, it’s even more tiring than before… It’s a shitshow, to be honest.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">My friend Hokuto once told me how we could turn into wizards if we’re still virgins at 30 and I thought it was such a stupid myth. Jokes on me, the myth isn’t one. I had even forgotten about it until it happened to me, I cursed the universe for being such an asshole to me. I didn’t ask to be a <em> virgin</em>, and I absolutely didn’t ask to have this power. It’s the worst power to have. I preferred being super smart, at least it’d be useful or something. I mean… being overwhelmed with a ton of dark, dumb and deep thoughts from strangers is not the most agreeable thing on Earth. I don’t need the unnecessary stress that comes with it. I just wanna be alone and in peace… </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As if it wasn’t hard being a virgin who didn’t have many occasions to bond and find new friends and partners, but with that power? It became one million times worse!</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sighing deeply, I try to move away from the girl next to me who was squealing so loudly in her head while watching a video of an idol jiggling on her smartphone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Although I used to be reluctant to go to work, I now cannot wait to be at work – there, at least, rare are the people coming to touch me so I won’t be hearing anyone’s thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After rushing out of the subway station, I run into my building faster than ever as if my life depends on it. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When I’m walking towards the elevator to get to my floor, only a few people are waiting but as soon as I enter, a surge of employees follow suit and push me into the back of the elevator. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “Wow, I made it in time! Lucky!” </em>
</p><p align="justify">I feel like crying. Again a crowded place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “It stinks in here, it’s only morning… Do people shower?” </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Loud. These are way too loud thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em> “Wow, our shoulders are touching!!!” </em>
<em>“He’s so cute, today too…” “His bed hair is so adorable…” “I wish I could smooth it out by stroking the back of his head but it’s too creepy!!” </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I subtly look at the people around me, and I realize that a long-time colleague had his shoulder crushed against mine and unconsciously, I look up to meet his eyes. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It’s Jesse, a team member of the marketing team. Difficult not to know him, he’s quite popular and easy to work with. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as our gazes meet, both his eyes and his body coldly shy away from me, cutting his stream of thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He has always been a rather friendly guy with a sense of distance. I’m really surprised he has this kind of thoughts. For a guy, moreover! I wonder who is the guy he likes so much. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before I could wonder any longer, the elevator suddenly empties itself and the crowd diminishes floor after floor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At our floor, only Jesse and I get off. I awkwardly give him a smile to tell him that he can head out first. He gives me a calm smile:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“G’morning, Kochi-san.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mhn, morning.” I babble, my mouth isn’t working well today! Well, try to be me for one minute and you’ll find out how difficult it is!</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I unintentionally lower my head, too embarrassed to even meet his eyes again as I walk straight towards my desk. He quietly laughs when he hears me hit my foot against my chair.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How could he even see me, his cubicle is so far from mine… </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">To be honest, I’m really unsettled by his thoughts.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I’ve never thought that Jesse, the perfect boy of the company, had a crush on anyone. He really hid it well, because he always has a friendly aura that makes him both approachable but unreachable. Since he always acts so nice to everyone, it is difficult to know what his real thoughts are.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">We both joined the company at the same time but I’m actually a bit older than he is. I was in another company that decided to move their headquarters to Singapore and asked me to go with them. Of course I declined, I’m not well versed in English and I don’t see myself in another country than Japan.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I then applied for this company, along with Jesse who was fresh out of university. We’re not in the same department but we interact quite often. I’ve never really paid attention to him before. He’s the embodiment of a dazzling existence that sort of exhausts me, so I don’t actively seek him. Or anyone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe that’s why I’m a virgin, I don’t seek friendship or love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When I first discovered my powers, I thought of getting rid of my virginity with a “<em> professional” </em> but I was so stressed out and her thoughts were so overwhelmingly graphic that I threw up before her. It was embarrassing. But every time I hear people’s kinkiest thoughts, I feel like passing out. It’s just too intense for me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There is a colleague that I find immensely pretty and wanted to talk to her but every time I tried, I found myself falling into a pit of negativity, wondering why would she even pay attention to me. I’m not worth any attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse, however, is worth the attention. He’s really good at making small talk, hyping people up, and cheering them up. I don’t know how he does it, but it makes me feel self-conscious and a bit irritated at how well he brings people together. More than that, he gathers people around him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">During lunch, he’s always surrounded by a bunch of people asking him out and he always chooses someone he has never eaten with before. Today, too, but for some reason, as he hesitates on whoever to choose, his eyes fall on me and our eyes meet again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I’m not sure why he looked at me but I immediately looked at my screen where the numbers and the categories get even blurrier and more mixed up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t sleep on the job, Kochi, we need people to be paid by tomorrow,” my manager said.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">We’re short-handed and there are around 300 employees in S company and I have to manually input all of the transfers that have to be made to every employee in this company. I think I’ll still be there tomorrow…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p>
