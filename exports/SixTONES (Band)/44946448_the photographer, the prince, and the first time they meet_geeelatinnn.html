    <h2 class="toc-heading">the photographer, the prince, and the first time they meet</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="justify">
  <span>Tanaka Juri had little to no knowledge of classical music nor did he intend to learn it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="right">
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga lives and breathes classical music.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The journalism club gathered around the conference table: the writers on the left, the photographers on the right, Hirose Alice - the editor-in-chief - at the middle end of the table, and Tanaka Juri on the other end. The room was filled with the sound of click-clacking mouse and keyboards as members take down notes, researched events, and searched for shot pegs all while listening as Alice handed out their assignments for the month.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>For reasons not anyone even dared to ask about, their university’s busiest month was February. Sports competitions, musical competitions, scholastic decathlons, and a bunch of other events were slated to happen every weekend. Some events even coincided with others. Which in turn made February also the busiest month for the journalism club. On regular issues of the school’s paper, they get to choose whatever they want to write about. But for February events, Alice gets to decide and it depends on the previous months’ performance of the member.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Tanaka, you have no other choice but to take this assignment." Alice said in a stern voice. "All other photographers already have assigned articles to cover and we cannot cover the music competition."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Why can't we just move people around? I'll take over someone else's work, someone who would be interested in hearing classical music all day long." Juri browsed through the catalog of their feature line-up. He had nothing in particular that he wanted to cover. But the music competition was the least bit interesting to him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“For the three years you’ve been part of this club, Tanaka, you’ve never once covered the classical music competition. It’s a yearly event cut into three phases: preliminaries, semi-finals, and finals. You haven’t even at least attended one.” Alice pointed out.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s because I am not the least bit interested to listen to classical music for roughly four hours of my day.” Juri argued. “Assign it to someone else,” Juri observed Alice’s reaction closely as he voiced his concern sternly than how he requested before.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But Alice was keeping her composure. “I did not want to use my editor-in-chief slash journalism club president card but you’re really pushing me right now Tanaka.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>One thing he admired about Alice was her composure. One thing that Juri enjoyed was testing her limits. “I am the lead photographer of the club. I can just reshuffle it one my own.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Just fucking do it!” Alice raised her voice to which Kento beside her reached for her hand to ground her back to reality. “Damn it, Tanaka. You always get to me,” Alice squeezed Kento’s hand back. “My decision is final. Besides, maybe if you actually give it a chance you might even thank me later.</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was true that Juri never once stepped foot inside the university’s auditorium for all the past classical music competitions that their campus hosted.  Juri did not even read the classical music competition feature of their newspaper. This made Juri do a last-minute read on what he needed to know about the competitors to have an idea. Luckily for him, his roommate Matsumura Hokuto - who was also one of the journalism club’s researchers - was good at preparing notes for a last-minute read. The notes were detailed enough despite only filling up half a page of the notebook for each participant. Juri placed the notebook in his hoodie’s pocket, just in case he had the time to check it in between performances.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>This being Juri’s first time, he was surprised at the turn-out of the audience. Some came from other universities to support their representatives and some were familiar faces he had seen around the campus. The auditorium was filled to its limit. The ushers had to restrict the entrance of people to make sure there were still areas that were walkable. This was something Juri appreciated, he did not expect it to be this crowded which would make it hard for him to move around to get good shots of the performers and the audience as well.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri could hear the performances, but nothing resonated with him. As he observed the performers while they perform, the judges as they focus on the performance, and the audience, Juri could tell that they appreciated the performance in different ways. He had worked a lot with covering various events and being a psychology major, he could recognize people’s emotions and reactions without having to talk to them. He could tell a lot by looking at someone’s non-verbal. People often told him he was gifted. But to him, this talent of his was both a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing as it helped him choose the right moment to capture with his camera and also proved to be useful in choosing final cuts that would make it to be published. It was a curse as it kept his circle of trusted friends to a minimum.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Tanaka Juri was after all one of the popular students. Juri had a good way with his words and was not one to refuse an invitation. But he was never seen with the same person twice, Juri never let anything go far when he noticed even a tiny tinge of being uncomfortable with him. He earned the reputation of being a playboy which somehow made him even more sought after by people. He could tell when someone genuinely wanted to get to know him or they just wanted to confirm gossip about him. Despite being popular and hanging out with people at parties and such, Juri only ever trusted a few people: Matsumura Hokuto, Hirose Alice (his childhood friend), Morimoto Shintaro, and recently Yamazaki Kento, Alice’s boyfriend.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri carried on with his assignments. Although he could not relate to why they were feeling the emotions they were feeling, everyone was giving him good material to work with. Being partly detached and uninterested, he was able to focus on getting good shots. That was until the last performer stepped on stage.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The music that flowed through the keys commanded and demanded Juri’s attention. The performance felt different from all the rest. Indeed, he heard the other performers, but this time he listened. The music did not only speak to his ears, it spoke to the core of his soul. Juri almost forgot to take photos, what with the audience looking stunned as well. He recognized the performer from the notes that Hokuto prepared for him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga. The music department’s prince.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The place seemed to have stilled except for Taiga who was playing a piece. Juri felt like it was a sin to move during the performance, but he had to do what he came here to do. Even if every fiber of his being just wanted to appreciate listening to a performance like this for the very first time in his existence.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There was a bit of a wait between Taiga finishing his performance and the judges posting the final lineup of who would be the ones competing during the semi-finals.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga topped the list when it was finally posted. The performers retreated back to their dressing rooms, marking the end of the event but not the end of Juri’s assignment. He still had to take some backstage photos, especially of the performers in case Alice chooses someone they would make a solo feature for.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The dressing room was shared by four performers. It was a little cramp with the people inside: the performers and whoever their plus ones were. Reaching the final room, Juri saw Taiga - pale skinned and chocolate brown hair even under a dimmer light than the one on stage. Taiga was the only one who was alone inside the room.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri finished up what he came there for before he approached Taiga to make small talk. If he read him correctly, Taiga was sad - at least that was what his reflection in the mirror seemed to show Juri.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hey, Kyomoto Taiga, right?" Juri said as he stood beside Taiga's assigned vanity mirror.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hi," A smile spread on Taiga's face. He looked genuinely relieved that someone was talking to him. "Uhm," He squinted his eyes to read Juri's press ID. "Tanaka Juri…?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yeah. I took photos for the university newspaper. To cover the event."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, uhm," Taiga looked down on his clothes with worry on his face. "I already changed to my regular clothes. Do you need me to, uhm… change?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Ah, no, it's alright. I got plenty earlier.” Taiga nodded as Juri talked. “Are you waiting for anyone?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shock. Panic. In split seconds, Taiga showed both. He looked to the sides to check if anyone was listening, but everyone else were busy packing and talking with their companions. Taiga stood up and leaned closer to Juri, not too much to invade personal space but close enough to talk in a lower voice.  “I’m waiting for everyone else to leave before I go. So they won’t know no one came for me.” Taiga pulled back. “Are you here to see anyone in particular? Or waiting for someone?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There was hope in Taiga’s eyes. Juri knew there was an answer that Taiga was waiting for, he just doesn’t know what it was.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Not really. I could up and go anytime. Sorry, am I bothering you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga’s eyes brightened and his lips tug up in a small smile. “Would you like to have a meal with me?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There it was again. Hope. This time Juri assumed that Taiga was waiting for a positive response to the invitation. He doesn’t have any plans tonight nor does he have anything he needed to prepare for tomorrow. Taiga’s expectant kitten like eyes were making it clear that refusal would break his spirit.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Sure. Do you have any place in mind? Also,” Juri looked around before lowering his voice. “Do you mind getting in the car of someone you just met?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, it would be weird if you drove there and I take a cab, wouldn’t it?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Makes sense.” Juri smiled. “Do you need help with your stuff?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga shook his head, biting back a smile as he hurriedly shoved the rest of his stuff inside his bag. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri let Taiga key in the address of where they were going, not bothering to ask the name of the place and just drove according to what the GPS voice told him to go. The ride was quiet, it wasn’t like they had something to talk about. The GPS also showed that they would be there in under ten minutes, not even really enough time to build up a conversation. Juri glanced over at Taiga, who was seated comfortably at his side. No sign of uncomfortableness. Taiga had never even once pulled out his phone since they left the dressing room nor has he fidgeted with anything in his bag. If anything, this did not look like the first car ride they shared together.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Pull up at the front entrance,” Taiga said when they got closer to their destination.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was a condominium building. A fancy-looking one for that matter. Not really a place you’d think a university student would be staying at. Juri pulled up at the front entrance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Are you going to drop off your stuff first?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Huh? No. I told you, we’re having a meal.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Here?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga nodded. “The valet will park your car. Are you alright with that? Or would you rather drive it all the way up the top floor of the parking area?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri was not the best when it came to heights. That includes high buildings. He did not even dare ask how high up the top floor of the parking area was. “The valet it is.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga was the first to get off the car and called the valet to park Juri’s car. Walking inside the building, Juri could already tell how fancy and expensive the place must be. They got on the elevator where Taiga pressed on the topmost floor. Juri did not want to jump to conclusions but from what he knew, top floors usually hosted penthouses.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Make yourself at home,” Taiga said as they walked inside his unit.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was the penthouse. Juri suddenly felt nervous that he might run into Taiga’s parents here because there was no way a university student was living alone there.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The place looked pristine. It was not like any home Juri has been before. The furniture and the appliances all matched and are within the spectrum of whites. Everything looked planned and precisely placed to the optimized organized position.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span> He followed close behind Taiga to the kitchen.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I live alone by the way,” Taiga said as he rummaged through his refrigerator. “So there’s no need to be tense. No one else is coming. Are you okay with lasagna? I made it yesterday because I was too nervous for the competition today.” Taiga held the lasagna tray in his hands as he waited for an answer.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri nodded. “Do you need my help with anything?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I can manage. Besides, I invited you here anyway. I’m going to have to reheat this before we can eat and maybe make some garlic bread. You can go watch tv or play with whatever console in the living room. Again, you can relax. It’s just us here.” Taiga was nonchalant about Juri being in his home, he busied himself with preparing their meal.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga was already so consumed by the task of preparing dinner that Juri just did what he was told and walked back to the living room. He leisurely looked around Taiga’s place. For someone who lived alone, it was kept well together. Juri briefly wondered if a cleaner usually came over, Taiga was probably rich enough to afford it if his parents were able to afford such a place for him. A lot of trophies, awards, and certificates were displayed in between two doors that were closed, right before the stairs leading up to the second floor. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri went back to the kitchen, feeling a little shy that he was not helping out. The least he felt that he could do was at least keep Taiga company. The smell of lasagna and garlic bread was battling each other, it was making Juri hungrier than he thought.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey, I thought I told you to relax?” Taiga chuckled. “It’ll just take a few more minutes.” He said as he set the table for two. “Was it too much that I took you here already? Does it make you uncomfortable?” he had his back turned on Juri as he talked.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It was a bit of a surprise. After all, we just met.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Before Taiga could respond, the bell of the oven rang. “It’s done!” Taiga said as he took out the lasagna. “Eat as much as you want. So I could at least make up for taking you home on the first day we met.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unlike the quiet car ride, the two talked more while they ate. Taiga genuinely listened in as Juri told stories about his hometown, something Juri was not able to do often as it was a topic his dates usually asked. Taiga nodded here and there as he listened, throwing in some questions from time to time. Juri asked Taiga about himself as well, real getting to know questions without having to think about noting something that might be useful for the newspaper, he made mental notes of what Taiga was saying because he genuinely wanted to know about him. Their conversation flowed naturally. They don’t even notice the time or the fact that they ate half the tray of lasagna even though it was just the two of them eating.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey, at least let me clean up.” Juri offered as they cleared off the table. “It’s the least I could do. I really had fun talking to you and it was really good lasagna too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, if you insist.” Taiga said. “I’ll just fix some of the things in my bag in my room, I’ll leave the door open so just get in when you’re done, okay?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Gotcha,”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Everything in the kitchen was well organized and labeled that it was easy to find what he needed to wash the dishes. Juri opted to hand wash the plates they used and placed back the lasagna inside the refrigerator when he had all the dishes in the drying rack. Now that Juri had turned off the faucet, he could hear a faint melody. It was coming from Taiga’s room. A grand piano was situated in the far left corner of the room next to the window.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri was drawn in by the melody. He was even more drawn in by Taiga’s beauty. Maybe that was part of the reason he said yes to him, part of the reason he was okay with being taken to someone’s home on the first day they met.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga’s beauty.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Tanaka Juri had little to no knowledge of classical music nor did he intend to learn it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>But standing here now, watching Taiga play piano in a very relaxed state. The music was consuming him. It felt like nothing else mattered, it was just him and Taiga enveloped in the melody that played. Taiga glanced at him when he felt that he was no longer alone, finishing the last movement on the sheet before standing up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Juri,” Taiga called him casually, searching his eyes for signs of whether he should not have done so. He waited for Juri to say something, anything.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hi, Taiga,” Juri talked casually as well which made Taiga smile at him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Juri.” Taiga stepped closer, invading Juri’s personal space. Their feet were touching. Taiga’s eyes were fixed on Juri’s, holding his gaze before leaning in to kiss Juri. He gasped when Juri kissed him back.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their kiss started off soft and slow, Taiga’s hand snaking behind Juri’s neck to pull him close. Juri cupped his face, gently rubbing his thumb on Taiga's cheek as they continued to exchange soft, unhurried kisses. Taiga smiled and Juri chuckled in relief. They could no longer tell which of them was initiating the kisses, they just kept chasing each other's lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hunger.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their kiss came in harder. Tongues pushing on each other. Mouths being explored. Hands moving all over each other’s body as they both desperately pulled the other one closer. Taiga was the first to make a move on removing the other’s clothes, pulling over Juri’s hoodie along with his shirt to which Juri obliged and removed Taiga’s sweater as soon as his was off. Taiga led them to the direction of his bed. Their lips swollen but were still chasing each other as they fumbled on getting the other’s pants off.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga pushes Juri on the bed once they were both fully naked. Juri pulled himself up for his head to reach the pillows. Taiga planted kisses from Juri’s hip going up to his chest, his neck, kissing around his jaw, before claiming back Juri’s lips. Juri placed his hands on Taiga’s hip, pulling him down for their cocks to hit each other. Juri rocked his hips all while maneuvering Taiga’s hip movement as well for the friction their cocks so desperately craved. Their breaths became even more uneven with moans and pants escaping them from the pleasure they were feeling.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga pulled up his hips, leaving Juri wanting more. He started mapping Juri’s body with kisses again, his hands trailing down and settling on Juri’s thigh. Taiga looked up at Juri and closely watched his reaction as he took his cock inside his mind.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Fuck. Taiga. Fuck!” Juri could not help but thrust his hip up to chase Taiga’s warm mouth whenever he bobbed his head.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga looked down. Attention focused on Juri’s throbbing cock. He took him in deeper. Tracing his veins with his tongue. Juri grabbed a fistful of Taiga’s hair. His body squirmed in pleasure. Taiga sucked him harder, deeper, hallowing his cheeks as he bobbed his head.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri stopped Taiga when Taiga reached for his own ass. “Let me take care of that, come here.” Juri pulled Taiga up to him. “Do you have lube or would we need to improvise?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I have some,” Taiga stretched to reach the drawer of his bedside table. He pulled out condoms - plural - and a bottle of lube. He settled the condoms on top of the table before coating Juri’s fingers with lube.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Lie down,” Juri said. He rolled over to get on top of Taiga. He peppered him with kisses while his fingers rubbed on Taiga’s entrance. He kissed Taiga on his lips again as one finger entered Taiga. Juri took his time with moving his first finger inside Taiga, adding in another one when Taiga seemed to eased up a little bit more.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was Juri’s turn to trail kisses down Taiga’s body. He kissed around Taiga’s crown first, licking around it before taking Taiga’s cock inside his mouth the same time he added a third finger in Taiga’s ass. Juri could tell that Taiga’s cock was bigger than him. He briefly wondered how it would feel inside his ass, he was usually the one that does the thrusting but he quite enjoyed being drilled himself.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Juri! Juri!” Taiga desperately called out. He got so desperate he pulled Juri by the hair just to get his attention and mouth away from his cock.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Sorry, do you not like getting head?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s not it. I wanna be fucked. Like now.” Taiga showed no hint of shame even after admitting how horny he was already. He was consumed by lust and it showed in his eyes. “Please, Juri.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hold on,” Juri pulled out his fingers and reached for one of the condoms. Taiga’s eyes were on him as he put the condom on. He lined himself up on Taiga’s entrance, pushing in slowly. With every push, Taiga whimpered. “Relax.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I can’t. I want it so bad.” Taiga admits. “Don’t worry. I can take it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri was really in awe of Taiga’s beauty. Even up close, with swollen lips, and all consumed with lust, Taiga was beautiful. As much as Juri did not want to hurt Taiga, he also did not want to refuse him of what he wanted. Besides, it was not like he was not enjoying this himself. Taiga's beauty was all consuming and Juri was being sucked in, wanting more of what he could be given for the night.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri moved slowly but finally bottomed out. He waited for Taiga to adjust for him before moving again. He moved at a leisurely pace. He was not so sure anymore if he was moving slowly for Taiga’s comfort or because he was enjoying Taiga’s warmth a little too much.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Fuck,” Juri said under his breath as he picked up his pace. He gave Taiga a long searing kiss before pulling back to observe every single reaction he could see from Taiga's.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Surprise. Pleasure. Happiness. Each time Taiga's lips tugged in a satisfied smile made Juri want to pleasure him better, savor how his body welcomed him in.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Fuck me as hard as you want, Juri. Please, fuck me until you finish inside me.” Taiga begged for more. He gripped hard on Juri's shoulders. "Fucking shit. I want you."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri knew he would not last long if he moved faster. He was still overly sensitive from the blowjob Taiga did earlier. “I won’t last.” Juri managed a chuckle. "God, Taiga. You feel so good." He kissed his cheek.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t care if you don't last long.” Taiga pulled him to kiss him softly. An assurance that he really did not care whether Juri would last long or not.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri pulled away from the kiss, burying his forehead on Taiga’s shoulder as he picked up his pace. Taiga moved his hips in time with Juri’s thrusts. Juri reached for Taiga’s cock but Taiga stopped him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No. I only want to feel you. We’ll deal with my cock later,” Taiga spread his legs as far as he could, raising up his knees to better angle his hips making his body even more inviting for Juri.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri knew he was hitting Taiga’s spot as the other’s moans grew louder and louder. Encouraging Juri to pound into him even harder. As he expected, it only took him a few more thrusts before he was emptying himself inside the condom. Juri’s movements staggered as continued thrusting in until he had released all his cum on the condom. He pulled out of Taiga slowly and rolled over the other side. There was a box of tissue beside the bed, Juri wrapped the condom in tissue first and settled it on the table as both of them tried to catch their breath.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga turned on his side. “Juri, could you lie face down on the bed, please?” he moved to the side until he reached the edge, making room for Juri to lie down in the middle of the bed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri was not sure what the request was about but did so anyway. Taiga got on top of Juri, settling Juri between his legs before he mapped out Juri’s backs with kisses.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“God, you’re sexy,” Taiga said in between kisses. “The dips and the curves of your back are defined even if you’re skinny,” he traced Juri’s back with his fingers, emphasizing his point. “You’re a treat, aren’t you? Your thin soft lips,” Taiga continued with the kissing and tracing of Juri’s back as he talked in between his kisses. “Your veiny cock… your smile’s really nice too…”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri has been called sexy several times, from past hookups. But no one ever said anything specific unlike Taiga. “You’re a treat yourself, you know?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga chuckled. “Have you ever taken a cock in your ass?” He leaned down, rubbing his cock in between Juri’s butt cheeks.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“God, what I would give to see your face when you talk crass like that. I do. Is that how you want us to take care of your cock this time?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes,” Taiga reached for the lube, coating his fingers while his cock was still leaning in between Juri’s butt cheeks. He warmed up his fingers before he got moving to stretching Juri. “Damn, you’re tight.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You were too, just so you know. I don’t normally let anyone fuck my ass on the first night.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So I’m an exception then.” Taiga was triumphant. Getting impatient. Taiga moved faster. Adding another finger in and scissoring Juri open in preparation for his cock. “Fuck,” Taiga said as he pulled out his fingers to put a condom on his cock.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is something wrong?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, I don’t know how to fuck you." Taiga admitted without any hesitation or shame. "Part of me wants to see your face while I fuck you." He kissed Juri's neck. "But I really do find your back sexy so I kinda want to do you from behind."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri laughed in an amused tone. “You already saw my sex face when I was fucking you. It’s time you indulge yourself with my back. Do me from behind.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I won’t last long. I’m still overly sensitive from getting head and getting fucked in the ass.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Such a pretty boy with a dirty mouth. I don’t need to be fucked for long, so long as it feels good.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unlike Juri, Taiga did not take his sweet time to fuck Juri’s ass. Although Taiga still entered Juri slowly, as soon as Juri had adjusted to his size, Taiga thrust in hard and fast. He moved as though this was a moment he was waiting for the whole night. It was Juri’s turn to squirm on the bed, alternating between pants and moans. Taiga leaned down and kissed Juri’s shoulder blades.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Fuck, I’m coming,” Taiga warned before he spilled his cum inside the condom. He supported himself up with his shoulders as he pulled out of Juri, catching his breath for a bit before rolling over to the side. “God, we need to shower.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We broke out quite a sweat, didn’t we?” Juri chuckled as he shuffled to lie down on his back. “We should go together to save time.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga chuckled. “We should. It is getting late. You should spend the night here."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri started kissing Taiga's jaw. "Before that, do you think you could still go for another? I got hard again when you were fucking me."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It depends. Do I get to ride?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Do you want to?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga nodded in response.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Alright then." Juri lay flat on his back.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga positions himself on top of Juri.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Excitement. Taiga was excited as he put a condom on Juri before lining him up with his ass. Still a little loose from getting fucked earlier, Taiga was able to smoothly sink down on Juri's cock. Juri held Taiga on his hips, helping him with his movements.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck, your ass feels really nice." Juri said as he held him tighter. He urged Taiga to move faster.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Fuck," Taiga used up the bit of strength left in him and moved as fast as he could.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The bed creaked from all the hard movements the two were making. Taiga bouncing his ass on Juri and Juri thrusting his hip to meet Taiga's movement.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri came not long after they started.</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri and Taiga ended up making out again under the shower. Lips on each other and hands all over their bodies again. They were able to wash off their sweat from earlier, but shower water was not enough to wash off their horny ass. Not even bothering to dry off, the two tried making their way back to the room while their hands continued to map out and press on each other’s body and their lips engaged in kisses that only got messier with every clumsy step they took.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They don’t even make it to the bedroom. They ended up on Taiga’s carpeted living room floor. Cocks all hard and needy for attention. But with no condoms within reach, fucking the other’s ass was not an option. Instead, they sucked each other off and fucked each other’s mouths at the same time. Miraculously coming together at the same time.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They lie on the carpet for a few minutes. Fighting to catch their breaths before actually succeeding on taking a shower to clean themselves off.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga’s bed was big enough for both of them. With already having seen each other naked and being inside each other, the two agreed that sleeping on the same bed was not such a bad idea.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Come here,” Juri said as he pulled Taiga in an embrace. “Good night, Taiga. Dream of wonderful things.”</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The next morning, Juri wakes up alone on the bed. Taiga’s side was already tidied up. A set of clothes was folded on top of the table beside the bed. It fit Juri just right despite them being Taiga’s clothes.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri found Taiga in the kitchen. Already had the table set for their breakfast.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Good morning." Taiga greeted him with a smile and bright eyes. "Breakfast?” Taiga offered.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How could I resist when they smell this good?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The two fell into a conversation again while they ate. More random topics about themselves again.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Juri, I really enjoyed myself last night.” Taiga said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I did too. But just to be clear, that wasn’t really my intention why I came here with you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Of course, it wasn’t. You didn’t even know we were coming to my place.” Taiga reminded him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why did you take me here?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga dropped his fork and air got caught in his throat. “It’s… don’t laugh, okay?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I won’t.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’m in my senior year of university, you see. But I’ve never done anything spontaneous. I had to always be precise, movement calculated, and choices planned and informed. You get the point,”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri nodded. “Yeah, I get the picture. My roommate is the same. Was. Was the same until he met his half-american boyfriend.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You were so nice when you made small talk with me,” Taiga continued. “I don’t know how to explain it but I felt comfortable with you in an instant. I took you home because I wanted to talk more. I didn’t even really think about sex. I just wanted to kiss you, Tanaka Juri. Be spontaneous for once and just act on how I felt in the moment.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Well, everyone wants to kiss the playboy whore so I can’t really blame you for that.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re not a playboy whore! That’s just a stupid university rumor!”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri was shocked with the way Taiga raised his voice as though he was the one being called a whore. There was sincerity in Taiga’s eyes as he said that he did not believe in rumors about Juri.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What makes you so sure?” Juri leaned back on the chair. His eyes not leaving Taiga to focus on observing his movements as he talked.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Because I felt it,” Taiga looked him in the eye and smiled. He broke eye contact but he was still relaxed as he spoke about Juri. “I felt it in the way you kissed me back. If you were only really after sex, your kiss would have been hurried from the get-go. But you kissed me slowly and softly, not like any of my past hook-ups. Not that I’ve had many. I felt it in the way you moved, you were really concerned about me. You weren’t voicing it out but I know you were also thinking about how comfortable or how in pain I am so you paced yourself. The sex was not just all want and lust, there was pleasure and warmth. If I’m even making sense. I felt it in the way you held me before we drifted to sleep.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Did your past hook-ups happen here too?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No. No one has been here except you. You have to understand, this is not me boasting about anything, alright? But look around you. My place screams money. And my face? Who wouldn’t want to fuck the rich pretty boy?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why did you take me here then? I’ll admit, I find you really beautiful and that’s part of the reason I was not too angry that you did not tell me we were going to your place.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I was betting on that, actually.” Taiga chuckled. “I was hoping the pretty privilege would work this time and I would be forgiven. As I’ve told you, I don’t know why but I just felt comfortable with you. You were the first ever person who approached me by asking if I was Kyomoto Taiga. You didn’t start by congratulating me, you never even brought up my win nor the awards I’m sure you saw last night. You didn’t start by calling me prince or whatever I had been tagged with. I felt that you might have wanted to see me for me. I purposely played the piano last night, see how you would react. I could tell my playing had an effect on you, but you still didn’t mention anything about it. No ‘you played beautifully’ or something along those lines. I waited for you to say something before I kissed you. I did not expect you’d kiss me back but you did.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I was never really interested in classical music. Your playing was the first time I actually paid attention to it. If we’re really being honest here, yes, I would want to see you for you and not for how you’ve been tagged by rumor mills and feature articles. After talking with you, I am getting more interested in you. Not just because we had good sex.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Then would you like to hang out more?” Taiga asked boldly. “I won’t force classical music on you, even if it's my life.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri laughed. “Maybe, just maybe, I’ll grow to appreciate it with your help.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga gasped. “Is that a yes? Are we seeing each other again?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There were his hopeful doe eyes again. It was interesting to Juri how those same pair of eyes that were bright and hopeful this morning were the same pair of eyes dark and clouded with lust last night.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri laughed. “How are you the same person that was aggressively asking to get fucked last night? Are those the same pair of lips talking crass last night? You’re adorable.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s a yes..?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yes. We will be seeing each other again. If possible, I’d like it to be often.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Looking forward to getting to know more about you, Tanaka Juri.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Looking forward to figuring you out, Kyomoto Taiga.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Tanaka Juri had little to no knowledge of classical music nor did he intend to learn it. That was until Kyomoto Taiga who lives and breathes classical music came into his life.</span>
