    <h2 class="toc-heading">taken by surprise</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro’s eyes were already falling as he took his shoes by the doorway. Thankfully, Hokumi left the lights in the living room turned on since Shintaro was able to tell her that he was going to be late. Another Friday drinking session with his friends. Although he had their unit memorized like the back of his hand - after living here for three years since they started university - Shintaro was still wary that he might knock down something and wake up a sleeping Hokumi in the middle of the night.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi’s bedroom door was slightly opened, and a faint light could be seen illuminating the room. Shintaro chuckled, surely Hokumi fell asleep while reading one of her books again. Shintaro was still feeling warm from the alcohol. Another side effect of alcohol to him was intensifying his longing to see Hokumi, so he made his way to her room to say good night even if he expected to see her asleep.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was the middle of summer. Hokumi decided to volunteer for the university’s summer program for kids where they held various activities and workshops. Shintaro did not want her to stay at their apartment alone and decided to just get extra shifts at his part-time work. It was not like their parents would look for them since they themselves were rarely home. If given the chance, both families met up for a meal as often as they could.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Inside the room, Hokumi was dressed lightly in one of her cropped shirts and what looked like a short skirt. Shintaro wondered if she felt cold at all, even if it was a summer night. But he couldn’t tell if the night was warm, cold, or just right since he was still affected by alcohol.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro walked over to Hokumi’s bed, it shifted a little when he sat down next to her. Gently, he pried off the book from Hokumi’s hand and settled it on top of the nightstand. Hokumi’s breathing was steady. The only sound that could be heard inside the room was the air conditioning unit. Shintaro could not help but stare at Hokumi, despite them growing up together, he was still in awe of her beauty. His eyes trailed from her face, down her neck, her chest, towards Hokumi’s exposed stomach - tone from the regular practice they had for being part of the swimming team.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro wanted to restrain himself, Hokumi was asleep and he had alcohol in his system. Yet, his hand had already found itself on Hokumi’s exposed waist, caressing it gently. Hokumi was still asleep despite their skin contact. With this, Shintaro felt a thrill, he wanted to touch her a little more, his hand moving down from her waist to her thighs. His eyebrows knotted when he could only feel the cloth of Hokumi’s short skirt, as though there was nothing underneath.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro had no explanation for what he was about to do next but curiosity was getting the best of him, he slipped his hand underneath the skirt.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What the hell?!” Shintaro muttered in the lowest voice he could.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi shuffled in her position. Slowly, she sat up. “You’re back,” she raised up her left leg. A smile played on her face.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No, no, no! Don’t do that.” Shintaro diverted his gaze. From where he was seated, with Hokumi’s one leg up making her skirt rise up for a bit, he was in the front row seat to see her exposed vagina.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why not?” Hokumi stretched her hand to draw circles on Shintaro’s thigh. She bit down on her lip, a knowing look on her face.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro gasped. “You naughty cunning little vixen!” Shintaro laughed a little.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Maybe, I am.” Hokumi moved her right leg and settled it on Shintaro’s lap. “But you’re still the fox who fell for it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>With nothing restricting him anymore, Shintaro touched Hokumi where she wanted him the most. He had a desire to get even with her, to catch her off guard just as he was caught off guard by her plans.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi might be muscular from all the swimming training, but she was still smaller than Shintaro. He was able to manhandle her with ease despite his alcohol intake. Hokumi just giggled when Shintaro moved her to the middle of the bed, biting her lip in anticipation of what he'll do next. Shintaro got rid of his jeans first to free his legs and have better control of his movements.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro got between her legs, without so much as a warning, he leaned down and liked her. Tasting her wet and waiting folds. He hears her sensual moan, not even a surprised gasp at Shintaro's sudden intrusion. Hokumi raked her fingers in Shintaro's hair, an encouragement to keep going.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro's eyebrows knotted. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was this part of her scheme?</span>
  </em>
  <span> He could not believe everything was falling right into place of Hokumi's plan. He wanted to get even but it seemed like Hokumi was already one step ahead of him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Intoxicated with her scent, her taste, and her moans, Shintaro threw away any thoughts of getting even with Hokumi. She could get whatever the hell she planned to get tonight. It's not like he got the shorter half of the stick anyway, he very much enjoyed the feast Hokumi prepared for him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>If Hokumi wanted to be pleasured so bad that she schemed her way through what she wanted to happen tonight, he might as well play his part well. With his tongue and left hand busy with licking Hokumi and flicking her clit, Shintaro supported his weight with his legs and reached up his right hand to knead on one of Hokumi's breast.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi was getting overstimulated. She squirmed on the bed and her breaths came in uneven. She frantically called out Shintaro's name when she could.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They got interrupted when Shintaro's phone started loudly ringing.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"God damn it!" Shintaro said as he fished his phone from his pants on the floor. "Fuck?" His eyes widened as he saw the date and time on his phone. "Oh my god! It's your birthday!" Shintaro had a frustrated expression on. Regret flushing over him and Hokumi could tell. "Fuck. And yet I just had to have a drinking session with friends the eve of your birthday."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hey," Hokumi sat up properly and pulled Shintaro to her. She cupped his face and kissed his nose. "Don't feel bad. We were having such a nice time. Besides, even if you reek of alcohol, I'd still choose you to be the one with me as I welcome in another year."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro snaked his hand behind Hokumi's neck. He pulled her close and kissed her lips softly. "Happy birthday," he kissed her again. "Let's both freshen up and pick up where we left off when I'm more sober, okay?" He picked her up from the nex and carried her bridal style to the bathroom.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They exchanged kisses inside the bathroom as they took off one item of clothing after another from the other one before getting under the shower water. The kisses turn as heated as the warm shower and the earlier promise of picking up where they left off when Shintaro was sober was forgotten.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro's fingers found themselves inside Hokumi again and this time Hokumi's finger wrapped around his arousal. Thankfully, they were able to at least wash off with soap before anything else. But now, they both had a sticky feeling coming from all the foreplay.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shit!" Shintaro grew harder. He was seeking much more warmth and softness than Hokumi's hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The way Hokumi laughed showed that she knew how Shintaro was feeling. She was pretty much seeking the same thing, Shintaro's cock inside of her. She closed in their distance, pulling off Shintaro's fingers from her with her free hand. She teased him a little by rubbing the head of his cock first before positioning it properly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Mi-chan, condom?" Shintaro put his arm around her waist to steady Hokumi's stance and be ready to support her in case she lost her balance.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm still good. We just went for the injection, remember?" Hokumi said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro always went with her on her appointments but he always gets lost in all the dates and number of days he loses track of when they can have sex without condoms. Knowing how responsible Hokumi is, he just trusted her word for it.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro slowly thrust into her. The floor was still a little slippery from the soap and water. Fucking standing up inside a bathroom was not the best idea they had tonight.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Despite the slow and steady thrusts, the two's desires were a little subdued. But Shintaro wanted more, he wanted to be rough with her. Get her to climax right here as it was what she had planned all along. He picked her up as if she weighed nothing, hooking her legs around his waist.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi yelp. She was taken by surprise at how Shintaro was able to carry her with ease. She knew how Shintaro's drinking party with his friends usually went, after the countless times that they have hosted such in their apartment. She's amazed at how Shintaro could still manhandle her despite the amount of alcohol he probably consumed.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro settled Hokumi on the vanity top. They engaged in a messy kiss, ragged breaths filled the room now that they were not under the shower. With better footing on the carpeted area around the sink, Shintaro picked up his pace. He slowly increased the speed of his thrust until he was relentlessly thrusting into Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro's movements were too rough and hard that Hokumi's breasts were bouncing from the intensity of her body getting shaken.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shinchan, I'm-"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yeah, right there with you." Shintaro was determined to get Hokumi to climax but tried his hardest to hold his back.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"A-" Hokumi was wetter and hotter as she reached her high. She fell down on Shintaro.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>After a few shallow thrusts, Shintaro pulled out. He jerked himself off and finished all over his hand instead of inside Hokumi.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>They both catch their breath first before washing off under the shower. Properly cleaning their bodies this time.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro picked up Hokumi in a bridal style carry again once they were both dry. He carried her to his room.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Wait! Aren't you going to let me get a nightgown first if we're sleeping in your room?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Nope!" Shintaro pecked at her lips. "I like you in my shirt. You'll sleep in my shirt tonight."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi giggled as Shintaro put her down on his bed. She followed Shintaro with her eyes as he made his way to his closet. That's when she sees it. Her eyes widened from shock.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Shinchan! That dress!" She pointed with her finger, too stunned to stand up.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, this pretty thing?" Shintaro put his arm over the mannequin with a smile on his face. "I'm gonna need to give the mannequin back to Taiga. But the dress and the bag, well. Happy birthday, Mi-chan!"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was the dress Hokumi had been eyeing every time they went to the mall. The bag was probably Shintaro's choice but it really matched well with the dress.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh my god. I love it, Shinchan!" Hokumi opened her arms wide and gestured for Shintaro to come over.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro dressed in his boxers and shirt first before going back beside Hokumi. He dressed her in one of his shirts, looking almost as long as Hokumi's summer nightgowns. "Adorable." Shintaro said before hugging her. "We can talk more tomorrow. You need to get some rest."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"But I'm feeling like rewarding you for getting me such a nice gift."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I shall claim my reward after you get some rest. I need you to have your stamina up."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokumi chuckled. "You just want to be sober when you fuck me again."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Of course! So I can better appreciate your beauty." Shintaro kissed both of Hokumi's cheeks before her lips. "Happy birthday, my Michan."</span>
