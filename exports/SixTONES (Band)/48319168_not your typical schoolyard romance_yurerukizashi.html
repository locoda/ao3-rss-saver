      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When Jesse and Yugo, who had an unexpected one-night stand, cross paths again, they must navigate the complexities of their intertwined lives as Jesse finds out that Yugo is a single father and his son happens to be Jesse’s student in the elementary school where Jesse works as a homeroom teacher.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This has been in my to-write lists for quite some time now, and I'm happy that I'm finally posting this bit by bit!</p><p>As usual, some notes:
</p><p>🧸: This is purely a work of fiction. Any actions by the characters do not reflect the idol and real-life personality of the idols involved.
</p><p>🧸: As Daigo is Yugo's brother in his fic, he goes by the surname Kochi.
</p><p>🧸: This fic will alternate points of view between Yugo and Jesse. So for Chapter 1, it will be Yugo's POV, then Jesse's POV for Chapter 2, and so on.
</p><p>That's all for now. Happy reading!</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>In the beating heart of Tokyo, high atop a Shibuya skyscraper, Yugo finds himself in a garden of laughter, light, and liquor. The rooftop bar hums with an eclectic mix of people, all there to unwind beneath a sequined sky. Yugo’s co-workers, a rowdy bunch of finance sharks, are swept away in the waves of whiskey and banter, but Yugo … he’s about as excited as a potato at a buffet.</p><p>“Come on, Kochi! Cut loose!” one of them nudges, waving a sloshing beer in his direction. He smiles politely, but inside he’s mapping out escape routes.</p><p>Just when he’s contemplating faking a text about a domestic emergency, his attention is captured by an attractive stranger at the adjacent table. The tall man has a smile as radiant as a sunbeam and a laugh that paints the air with joy.</p><p>The man returns his gaze with an inviting grin. His laugh punctuates the air, stirring something inside Yugo. He finds himself mirroring the man’s smile without thinking. But still, he quickly diverts his eyes, feeling a blush creep up his cheeks.</p><p>Heart pounding like a timpani, Yugo takes a gamble. He slips away to a corner, giving the scenic view a competition. The Tokyo skyline sprawls before him, neon lights winking through a veil of cherry blossoms. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots the man following him like a magnet.</p><p>“I’m Yugo,” he introduces himself as soon as the man stands beside him. “I … uh, work at a bank. Crunch numbers, you know.”</p><p>The stranger chuckles, extending a hand. “Jesse. I’m a teacher. I’m more into letters.”</p><p>Caught off guard by the man’s charm, Yugo stumbles over his words. “That’s, uh, different. Numbers, letters, huh?”</p><p>Jesse grins, nodding. “Yeah, quite the equation, huh? But don’t worry, I find you cute.”</p><p>Taken aback, Yugo blushes. He can’t recall the last time he’s flirted or even been flirted with. But as the night progresses, Jesse’s charm coaxes Yugo out of his shell. Laughter flows easily, the conversation laced with playful banter and shared smiles.</p><p>Beneath the dim lights of the bar and the spell of the Tokyo skyline, Yugo grows bolder. He matches Jesse’s playful touches, each one sending sparks up his spine. He’s tipsy, flustered, but oddly comfortable.</p><p>Under the twinkling city lights, Jesse leans in, his voice low and intoxicating. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stumbles over itself. He manages a nod, reaching for his phone to inform his brother of his extended “overtime.” He can hear Daigo’s laughter even through the text message, and he knows he’ll never live this down when he finds out what Yugo’s overtime actually meant.</p><p>He stands, swaying slightly as he presses a bold kiss to Jesse’s lips before pulling away, feeling a triumphant rush of adrenaline. “Lead the way, Jesse,” he murmurs, a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>As they make their way out of the bar, Yugo feels like he’s living in a dream, like he’s drifting on cloud nine. He steals a glance back at the bar, his co-workers still enraptured in their own world, none the wiser of his sweet escape.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the fluorescent glow of a love hotel sign, Yugo stands awkwardly, suddenly very aware of his sobriety. The blurred edges of the night have sharpened, and the weight of his responsibilities drops like an anvil on his mind. He’s a single father, for crying out loud, and his mind races with images of his six-year-old son, Takumi. Sure, his brother Daigo is babysitting, but what if something happens and he’s not there?</p><p>A hand on his shoulder brings him back to reality. Jesse frowns at him. “You okay?”</p><p>Yugo opens his mouth to tell Jesse about his worries, about Takumi. But he catches himself just in time. Telling a one-night stand about his child worries might not be the best topic of conversation. He settles for another truth. “It’s been a while since... well, you know.”</p><p>Jesse’s expression softens, and he takes Yugo’s hand, leading him inside. They enter the room that screams “cheap romance” with its heart-shaped cushions and satin sheets. Jesse settles onto a neon-purple couch, tugging Yugo onto his lap.</p><p>“If you feel uncomfortable, tell me, okay?” Jesse whispers, his breath warm against Yugo’s ear.</p><p>Yugo nods, the simple gesture making him feel better.</p><p>The kisses that follow are soft, hesitant at first, then growing passionate. As they lose themselves in each other, Yugo finds his worries melting away, replaced by a rush of desire. The taste of Jesse, the warmth of his skin against Yugo’s, the gentle exploration of hands — it all sends a whirl of heat through his body.</p><p>Time loses meaning as they move together, the rhythm of their hearts echoed in their movements. Jesse’s hands are everywhere, his touch sending waves of pleasure coursing through Yugo. His senses are filled with Jesse, the sight, the scent, the feel of him. It’s overwhelming and Yugo surrenders to the sensations, reaching the peak of his pleasure in a blaze of intensity.</p><p>As he lays in the aftermath, panting and satisfied, a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. Tonight, Yugo reminds himself, he can afford to let go of his responsibilities, just for a little while. Tomorrow, he’d be back to being the careful, loving father. But tonight, he’s just Yugo, a man enjoying a moment of wild abandon with a handsome stranger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the harsh morning light, Yugo comes to, his body pleasantly sore in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time. He squints against the sunlight filtering through the cheap blinds. His eyes wander over to the body beside him, Jesse, naked and fast asleep. As the memories of the night before hit him, Yugo’s cheeks color. That had been … quite the escapade.</p><p>His phone chooses that moment to beep, shattering the silence. It’s a text from Daigo, reminding him of his promise to take Takumi shopping. Yugo nearly chokes on his spit. He checks the time and his heart drops. He has less than an hour before Takumi wakes up, his tiny body filled with too much energy for a Saturday morning.</p><p>“Shit,” Yugo mutters, jumping off the bed, not caring about the fact that he’s as bare as a newborn. He hurriedly scavenges his clothes from the floor, throwing them on in record time. Shower? Who has time for that?</p><p>As he’s halfway through the door, Jesse stirs awake, blinking sleepily at Yugo. “Where are you off to?” he asks, his voice gruff from sleep.</p><p>Yugo freezes in his tracks. He doesn’t want to mention Takumi, so he lies. “Work emergency,” he says, gesturing to his crumpled suit. “You know how it is.”</p><p>Jesse rubs his eyes and nods. “Yeah, got it. Last night was fun.”</p><p>“Fun. Right,” Yugo says, managing a weak smile. “Thanks for … everything.”</p><p>With that, he dashes out of the room, leaving a sleepy Jesse in his wake. The things he does for his son, Yugo thinks, half-annoyed and half-amused. But as he races to make it home in time, there’s a part of him that can’t help but remember Jesse’s warm smile, the way he’d made Yugo laugh, the way he’d made Yugo’s toes curl with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Yugo enters his apartment, the warm smell of pancakes greets him. Daigo, chef’s hat askew and batter splattered on his apron, is in the kitchen, expertly flipping pancakes. “Takumi is still sleeping,” he says without looking up.</p><p>Nodding, Yugo tiptoes to his son’s room. Takumi’s asleep, cocooned in his spaceship-themed bedspread. The room is an organized chaos, full of half-assembled Lego sets, towering stacks of dinosaur books, and doodles of complex space machines. His heart swells with affection for the little genius. Where had the time gone? His baby is now a soon-to-be first grader.</p><p>“Time flies,” Yugo murmurs, ruffling Takumi’s hair lightly before leaving the room.</p><p>Back in the kitchen, Daigo pushes a glass of water and two aspirin towards him. “For your hangover.”</p><p>Yugo scowls. “I was at work.”</p><p>Daigo snorts, waving his phone in front of Yugo, a screenshot of a text he doesn’t remember sending on display. “So, ‘Work’ is a handsome man now?”</p><p>Yugo almost chokes on his aspirin. Sheepishly, he admits, “I might’ve … met someone.”</p><p>“Ha! I knew it! So, how was your ‘overtime’?” Daigo teases, pouring another pancake onto the griddle.</p><p>“It was … fun,” Yugo admits, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. “But I didn’t get his number.”</p><p>Before Daigo can pounce on that, the pitter-patter of small feet interrupts them. “Daddy!” Takumi’s voice rings out as he launches himself into Yugo’s arms. All worries and embarrassments are forgotten as Yugo pulls his son into a hug.</p><p>“Morning, buddy. Ready to get your school supplies later?” Yugo asks, ruffling his hair.</p><p>Takumi nods eagerly. “Did you have to work late again, Daddy?”</p><p>Yugo winces internally. “Yes, buddy. But I’m all yours today.”</p><p>As they have dinner, Yugo notices that Takumi has been staring at him strangely. But before he could ask, Takumi squints at something. “Daddy, why do you have a mosquito bite on your neck?”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stops.</p><p>A hickey.</p><p>Damn it, Jesse!</p><p>He glances at Daigo, who’s practically rolling on the floor, laughing. This was going to be a long day.</p>
