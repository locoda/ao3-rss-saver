      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This has been in my to-write lists for quite some time now, and I'm happy that I'm finally posting this bit by bit!</p><p>As usual, some notes:
</p><p>🧸: This is purely a work of fiction. Any actions by the characters do not reflect the idol and real-life personality of the idols involved.
</p><p>🧸: As Daigo is Yugo's brother in his fic, he goes by the surname Kochi.
</p><p>🧸: This fic will alternate points of view between Yugo and Jesse. So for Chapter 1, it will be Yugo's POV, then Jesse's POV for Chapter 2, and so on.
</p><p>That's all for now. Happy reading!</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>In the beating heart of Tokyo, high atop a Shibuya skyscraper, Yugo finds himself in a garden of laughter, light, and liquor. The rooftop bar hums with an eclectic mix of people, all there to unwind beneath a sequined sky. Yugo’s co-workers, a rowdy bunch of finance sharks, are swept away in the waves of whiskey and banter, but Yugo … he’s about as excited as a potato at a buffet.</p><p>“Come on, Kochi! Cut loose!” one of them nudges, waving a sloshing beer in his direction. He smiles politely, but inside he’s mapping out escape routes.</p><p>Just when he’s contemplating faking a text about a domestic emergency, his attention is captured by an attractive stranger at the adjacent table. The tall man has a smile as radiant as a sunbeam and a laugh that paints the air with joy.</p><p>The man returns his gaze with an inviting grin. His laugh punctuates the air, stirring something inside Yugo. He finds himself mirroring the man’s smile without thinking. But still, he quickly diverts his eyes, feeling a blush creep up his cheeks.</p><p>Heart pounding like a timpani, Yugo takes a gamble. He slips away to a corner, giving the scenic view a competition. The Tokyo skyline sprawls before him, neon lights winking through a veil of cherry blossoms. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots the man following him like a magnet.</p><p>“I’m Yugo,” he introduces himself as soon as the man stands beside him. “I … uh, work at a bank. Crunch numbers, you know.”</p><p>The stranger chuckles, extending a hand. “Jesse. I’m a teacher. I’m more into letters.”</p><p>Caught off guard by the man’s charm, Yugo stumbles over his words. “That’s, uh, different. Numbers, letters, huh?”</p><p>Jesse grins, nodding. “Yeah, quite the equation, huh? But don’t worry, I find you cute.”</p><p>Taken aback, Yugo blushes. He can’t recall the last time he’s flirted or even been flirted with. But as the night progresses, Jesse’s charm coaxes Yugo out of his shell. Laughter flows easily, the conversation laced with playful banter and shared smiles.</p><p>Beneath the dim lights of the bar and the spell of the Tokyo skyline, Yugo grows bolder. He matches Jesse’s playful touches, each one sending sparks up his spine. He’s tipsy, flustered, but oddly comfortable.</p><p>Under the twinkling city lights, Jesse leans in, his voice low and intoxicating. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stumbles over itself. He manages a nod, reaching for his phone to inform his brother of his extended “overtime.” He can hear Daigo’s laughter even through the text message, and he knows he’ll never live this down when he finds out what Yugo’s overtime actually meant.</p><p>He stands, swaying slightly as he presses a bold kiss to Jesse’s lips before pulling away, feeling a triumphant rush of adrenaline. “Lead the way, Jesse,” he murmurs, a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>As they make their way out of the bar, Yugo feels like he’s living in a dream, like he’s drifting on cloud nine. He steals a glance back at the bar, his co-workers still enraptured in their own world, none the wiser of his sweet escape.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the fluorescent glow of a love hotel sign, Yugo stands awkwardly, suddenly very aware of his sobriety. The blurred edges of the night have sharpened, and the weight of his responsibilities drops like an anvil on his mind. He’s a single father, for crying out loud, and his mind races with images of his six-year-old son, Takumi. Sure, his brother Daigo is babysitting, but what if something happens and he’s not there?</p><p>A hand on his shoulder brings him back to reality. Jesse frowns at him. “You okay?”</p><p>Yugo opens his mouth to tell Jesse about his worries, about Takumi. But he catches himself just in time. Telling a one-night stand about his child worries might not be the best topic of conversation. He settles for another truth. “It’s been a while since... well, you know.”</p><p>Jesse’s expression softens, and he takes Yugo’s hand, leading him inside. They enter the room that screams “cheap romance” with its heart-shaped cushions and satin sheets. Jesse settles onto a neon-purple couch, tugging Yugo onto his lap.</p><p>“If you feel uncomfortable, tell me, okay?” Jesse whispers, his breath warm against Yugo’s ear.</p><p>Yugo nods, the simple gesture making him feel better.</p><p>The kisses that follow are soft, hesitant at first, then growing passionate. As they lose themselves in each other, Yugo finds his worries melting away, replaced by a rush of desire. The taste of Jesse, the warmth of his skin against Yugo’s, the gentle exploration of hands — it all sends a whirl of heat through his body.</p><p>Time loses meaning as they move together, the rhythm of their hearts echoed in their movements. Jesse’s hands are everywhere, his touch sending waves of pleasure coursing through Yugo. His senses are filled with Jesse, the sight, the scent, the feel of him. It’s overwhelming and Yugo surrenders to the sensations, reaching the peak of his pleasure in a blaze of intensity.</p><p>As he lays in the aftermath, panting and satisfied, a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. Tonight, Yugo reminds himself, he can afford to let go of his responsibilities, just for a little while. Tomorrow, he’d be back to being the careful, loving father. But tonight, he’s just Yugo, a man enjoying a moment of wild abandon with a handsome stranger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the harsh morning light, Yugo comes to, his body pleasantly sore in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time. He squints against the sunlight filtering through the cheap blinds. His eyes wander over to the body beside him, Jesse, naked and fast asleep. As the memories of the night before hit him, Yugo’s cheeks color. That had been … quite the escapade.</p><p>His phone chooses that moment to beep, shattering the silence. It’s a text from Daigo, reminding him of his promise to take Takumi shopping. Yugo nearly chokes on his spit. He checks the time and his heart drops. He has less than an hour before Takumi wakes up, his tiny body filled with too much energy for a Saturday morning.</p><p>“Shit,” Yugo mutters, jumping off the bed, not caring about the fact that he’s as bare as a newborn. He hurriedly scavenges his clothes from the floor, throwing them on in record time. Shower? Who has time for that?</p><p>As he’s halfway through the door, Jesse stirs awake, blinking sleepily at Yugo. “Where are you off to?” he asks, his voice gruff from sleep.</p><p>Yugo freezes in his tracks. He doesn’t want to mention Takumi, so he lies. “Work emergency,” he says, gesturing to his crumpled suit. “You know how it is.”</p><p>Jesse rubs his eyes and nods. “Yeah, got it. Last night was fun.”</p><p>“Fun. Right,” Yugo says, managing a weak smile. “Thanks for … everything.”</p><p>With that, he dashes out of the room, leaving a sleepy Jesse in his wake. The things he does for his son, Yugo thinks, half-annoyed and half-amused. But as he races to make it home in time, there’s a part of him that can’t help but remember Jesse’s warm smile, the way he’d made Yugo laugh, the way he’d made Yugo’s toes curl with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Yugo enters his apartment, the warm smell of pancakes greets him. Daigo, chef’s hat askew and batter splattered on his apron, is in the kitchen, expertly flipping pancakes. “Takumi is still sleeping,” he says without looking up.</p><p>Nodding, Yugo tiptoes to his son’s room. Takumi’s asleep, cocooned in his spaceship-themed bedspread. The room is an organized chaos, full of half-assembled Lego sets, towering stacks of dinosaur books, and doodles of complex space machines. His heart swells with affection for the little genius. Where had the time gone? His baby is now a soon-to-be first grader.</p><p>“Time flies,” Yugo murmurs, ruffling Takumi’s hair lightly before leaving the room.</p><p>Back in the kitchen, Daigo pushes a glass of water and two aspirin towards him. “For your hangover.”</p><p>Yugo scowls. “I was at work.”</p><p>Daigo snorts, waving his phone in front of Yugo, a screenshot of a text he doesn’t remember sending on display. “So, ‘Work’ is a handsome man now?”</p><p>Yugo almost chokes on his aspirin. Sheepishly, he admits, “I might’ve … met someone.”</p><p>“Ha! I knew it! So, how was your ‘overtime’?” Daigo teases, pouring another pancake onto the griddle.</p><p>“It was … fun,” Yugo admits, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. “But I didn’t get his number.”</p><p>Before Daigo can pounce on that, the pitter-patter of small feet interrupts them. “Daddy!” Takumi’s voice rings out as he launches himself into Yugo’s arms. All worries and embarrassments are forgotten as Yugo pulls his son into a hug.</p><p>“Morning, buddy. Ready to get your school supplies later?” Yugo asks, ruffling his hair.</p><p>Takumi nods eagerly. “Did you have to work late again, Daddy?”</p><p>Yugo winces internally. “Yes, buddy. But I’m all yours today.”</p><p>As they have dinner, Yugo notices that Takumi has been staring at him strangely. But before he could ask, Takumi squints at something. “Daddy, why do you have a mosquito bite on your neck?”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stops.</p><p>A hickey.</p><p>Damn it, Jesse!</p><p>He glances at Daigo, who’s practically rolling on the floor, laughing. This was going to be a long day.</p>

  <p>Jesse is sprawled on the living room tatami mats, scrolling through the list of first-grade names on his tablet. The room is a cozy fusion of traditional and organized chaos—reflective of its occupants. Stacks of teaching resources dot one corner, while children’s toys sprinkle the floor.</p><p>He loves his job with a fierce, underlying passion. However, tonight, two weeks before his first day as a homeroom teacher, it is love of a different kind that disrupts his thoughts.</p><p>The foreign sound of his phone breaks the serenity.</p><p>“Hello?” Jesse answers, not bothering to check the caller ID. His eyebrows knit in surprise when he hears the voice on the other end. “Taiga?”</p><p>Across the room, his older sister Aya looks up from her game of pick-up sticks with her daughter, Sakiko. Her gaze lands on Jesse, who has gone rigid, his jaw tight.</p><p>Taiga’s voice, melodic and familiar, fills Jesse’s ear. “Hey. I just got back from abroad. Fancy some sushi tonight?”</p><p>Jesse’s heart flutters; the memoriesn of their passionate college days, filled with academic rivalry and romantic trysts, surfacing like a breeching whale. He chuckles nervously. “I … Well, can I think it over?”</p><p>“Okay.” Taiga states the name of the restaurant and hangs up.</p><p>Jesse stares at his phone, the past suddenly resurrected in his hand. He blinks and turns to Aya. “That was Taiga.”</p><p>Aya lifts an eyebrow. “The ex-boyfriend, Taiga?”</p><p>“No, the Martians have learned our language,” Jesse retorts, rolling his eyes. “Yes, the ex-boyfriend, Taiga.”</p><p>“Hmm, and what did he want?” Aya asks, her eyes flashing with intrigue.</p><p>“To meet up, discuss the Pythagorean theorem, you know, the usual,” Jesse replies, tossing his phone onto a cushion.</p><p>“And you said?” Aya presses.</p><p>“I said I’d think about it.”</p><p>Aya’s eyebrows rise again. “And are you?”</p><p>“Am I what?” Jesse asks, his heart thumping a jazz rhythm.</p><p>“Thinking about it,” she states matter-of-factly. Sakiko giggles at something, and Aya instinctively grabs her daughter before she tumbles over.</p><p>“Maybe. I mean, I don’t know,” Jesse mumbles, rubbing the back of his neck. He joins Sakiko on the floor, ruffling her hair absentmindedly. “I don’t know what he wants.”</p><p>Aya watches Jesse thoughtfully before answering. “Then maybe you should find out. It should be closure or, I don’t know, a new beginning.”</p><p>Jesse snorts. “Listen to you, sounding all wise. I wonder why you don’t have a boyfriend.”</p><p>Aya laughs. “Because Sakiko doesn’t need a new dad.”</p><p>“Right!” Sakiko chirps, the word a well-timed punchline that sends the room into peals of laughter.</p><p>As the laughter subsides, Jesse glances at the phone again. He thinks of Taiga—the fiery arguments, the shared dreams, the whispered confessions in the dark. His gut clenches. One meeting couldn’t hurt, would it?</p><p>He picks up his phone again, stares at it for a long moment, then dials a number.</p><p>“One step at a time, Jesse,” Aya murmurs, her words a gentle anchor in the storm of Jesse’s emotions.</p><p>He looks up, nods, and takes a deep breath.</p><p>“Hey, Taiga. About that meeting …”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stepping into the vibrant restaurant, Jesse takes in the bustling scene. The aroma of sizzling tempura and the low hum of conversation mingle with the jazz notes wafting from an antique jukebox, a fusion of old-world charm and modern tech.</p><p>Taiga is waiting by the window, his face illuminated by the neon city lights streaming in. He’s as beautiful as ever, the passage of time only deepening his allure. As they embrace, Jesse can’t help but think that Taiga’s hugs are as warm as a <em>kotatsu</em> in winter. A wave of nostalgia washes over him, stirring up feelings he thought he had buried.</p><p>Dinner is a flurry of shared tempura and soft tofu, punctuated by the staccato rhythm of their chopsticks and the soft swish of sake. Taiga surprises Jesse when he reveals his new job, teaching elementary school kids at the same school where Jesse is working.</p><p>“You’re joking!” Jesse exclaims, nearly choking on his udon. “That’s my school!”</p><p>Taiga’s brows rise, surprise etching his stunning features. “I swear I had no idea! I just got the job, I start on Monday.”</p><p>Jesse frowns, eyeing Taiga skeptically, yet a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. “I always knew you secretly wanted to copy me.”</p><p>As the alcohol flows, conversation shifts to their love lives.</p><p>“Have you been seeing someone?” Taiga asks, clearing his throat.</p><p>“Been dating casually.” Jesse shrugs. He remembers his most recent one-night stand — a banker named Yugo, who Jesse regrets not getting his number. “You?”</p><p>“Same — just dating around, but nothing serious.”</p><p>“I wonder what might have happened if we tried long distance,” Jesse muses, swirling his glass.</p><p>Taiga’s expression softens, and for a moment, the restaurant buzz fades into the background. “Who knows?” he replies, a thoughtful look crossing his face. “Maybe we were too young, too ambitious.”</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted by the jukebox, playing a cheerful tune that contrasts with the somber note their dialogue had taken.</p><p>Jesse laughs, dispelling the tension. “But who can think of what-ifs when I have tempura and sake in front of me?” he exclaims, popping a piece of tempura into his mouth with an exaggerated expression of delight.</p><p>Taiga chuckles, and for a moment, it feels like they’re back in college, sharing a simple meal after a long day of classes. They lock eyes, the spark of old love flickering but not quite catching. The evening passes with laughter and stories, a chapter of their lives reopened, if only for a fleeting moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Jesse and Taiga lose themselves in nostalgia, the restaurant staff’s discreet clean-up activities signal the end of the evening. “We should probably go,” Taiga suggests, looking somewhat reluctant to end the night. “I live close by. Wanna continue our conversation there?”</p><p>Jesse agrees, and soon they find themselves in Taiga’s apartment — a fascinating blend of sleek, modern lines and lush, tropical elements.</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “You’ve got plants? I remember you couldn’t even keep a cactus alive.”</p><p>“Cut me some slack, Jesse,” Taiga retorts, rolling his eyes playfully. “I’ve just moved in, and haven’t had time to redecorate. This was already a jungle when I arrived.”</p><p>As Jesse roams around, he spots an old photograph from their college days — two young men, laughing, oblivious to the world. The sight tugs at his heartstrings, awakening a flood of memories and emotions.</p><p>Suddenly, he feels Taiga’s arms wrap around him from behind. “I missed you, Jesse,” Taiga murmurs, his voice low and charged with emotion.</p><p>Jesse's breath hitches, their shared history echoing in his mind. “Are we … are we getting back together?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Let’s … let’s just catch up for now,” Taiga replies, his voice filled with hope and trepidation.</p><p>Then, in a surge of emotion, Jesse turns around and they share a slow and passionate kiss — a dance of familiarity and longing that makes Jesse’s heart flutter. But as their kiss deepens, Jesse pulls away, a sense of caution pulling him back to reality.</p><p>“We can’t … we can’t rush this, Taiga,” Jesse manages to say, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p>Taiga’s confusion is clear. “But you … you kissed me back.”</p><p>Jesse can’t deny it. He <em>did</em> kiss him back. But they’re high on old emotions, caught in a moment that’s both sweet and perilous. “We’re about to work together, Taiga. And this … this could make things complicated,” he admits. “Can we take things slowly?”</p><p>After a pause, Taiga reluctantly agrees. “Okay,” he says, disappointment seeping into his tone.</p><p>Jesse feels a pang of guilt, but he knows he’s made the right call. “Good night, Taiga. I’ll see you on Monday,” he says, bidding him farewell before stepping into the cool night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“So I left,” Jesse finishes. “Did I … did I do the right thing?”</p><p>In the heart of the apartment shared by Jesse and Shintaro, the dining room is a haven of creative chaos. Post-it notes with inspirational quotes dot the fridge. A sizable bookshelf stuffed with an eclectic mix of educational and philosophical texts occupies one wall. The table, more often than not, serves as a workstation, strewn with lesson plans, school memos, and half-finished cups of coffee.</p><p>On this morning, Jesse finds himself seated at the dining table, absently stirring his oatmeal while he recounts that evening with Taiga. Shintaro, despite being in the midst of a mad scramble to find his misplaced keys, offers his attentive ear.</p><p>Shintaro finally locates his keys, tucked behind a motivational plaque reading “Bless This Mess,” and breathes a sigh of relief. “Jess,” he begins, pouring himself a cup of coffee, “you know I’m all about living in the moment, but having sex with Taiga just for nostalgia’s sake, might not be the wisest decision.”</p><p>He takes a sip, then adds, “Working with him might get awkward if things don’t work out. You’re smart. You’re taking it slow.”</p><p>“But, what if—” Jesse starts, but Shintaro raises a hand, interrupting him.</p><p>“Just be open to the possibilities, dude,” Shintaro advises, leaning against the kitchen counter. “Maybe you and Taiga are meant to be, or maybe there’s someone else out there. Who knows?”</p><p>The mention of “someone else” evokes an image of Yugo in Jesse’s mind, causing his heart to flutter. He’d had several one-night stands, but somehow … he can’t forget his most recent one.</p><p>He pushes the thought away, focusing on his friend’s words as he takes a final spoonful of oatmeal. Shintaro’s right. Rushing into things with Taiga could make things messier.</p><p>A clatter from the kitchen brings Jesse back to reality. Shintaro, noticing the time, is hastily washing his dishes, splashing soapy water everywhere. “Hurry up with that breakfast, Jesse!” he yells over his shoulder. “We wouldn’t want you late for your first day as homeroom teacher.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the humming faculty room of the school, the hubbub quiets as the principal takes center stage. He begins introducing the new music teacher. Jesse, entering the room with the same perfect timing he uses to dodge questions about his love life, finds his eyes locking onto Taiga’s.</p><p>“Welcome to our team, Kyomoto-sensei!” the principal concludes, and the room erupts into polite applause. Jesse claps, too, his heart pounding like a drum solo.</p><p>As the meeting concludes, Jesse steels himself and walks over to Taiga. “Hey, are you mad at me?” he blurts out.</p><p>This earns him a sigh from his ex. “Jesse, you’re right,” he concedes, brushing a hand through his hair. “We should take it slow.”</p><p>Their conversation is cut short when Matsumura Hokuto, the dependable and pragmatic literature teacher, hovers on the desk next to Taiga’s. “Do you two know each other?” he asks.</p><p>“Same college,” Jesse replies, omitting the other details. “Hokuto, meet Kyomoto Taiga. He was my senior back in college. Tai—Kyomoto-san, meet Matsumura Hokuto. He teaches literature.”</p><p>Taiga gives Hokuto a small smile and a nod.</p><p>The bell chimes in the background, a call to arms for the teachers. “Well, nice meeting you, Kyomoto-san,” Hokuto says before striding off, a stack of literature textbooks under his arm.</p><p>Jesse’s first-grade classroom welcomes him with the smell of fresh paper and crayons, a realm decked in vibrant colors and cheerful drawings that he had labored over last Friday. His students trickle in, tiny bodies radiating nervous excitement.</p><p>“Hello, 1-B!” Jesse greets with a wide smile. “I’m Jesse Lewis, your homeroom teacher. But because my last name is hard to pronounce, you can call me Jesse-sensei! If you need anything, just let me know.”</p><p>The children respond with a chorus of “Good morning, Jesse-sensei!” their voices soft but filled with curiosity.</p><p>As Jesse starts roll call, he finds himself momentarily paused on a name. “Kochi Takumi,” he reads aloud, glancing up to meet a pair of intelligent eyes framed by thick-rimmed glasses.</p><p>Jesse squints at the boy. He feels an uncanny sense of familiarity but can’t put a finger on it. <em>Do I know him from somewhere?</em> he thinks, his eyebrows furrowed. <em>Did I teach his older sibling? Or perhaps, he looks like a celebrity?</em></p><p>The moment is cut short as Takumi confidently raises his hand and announces, “Jesse-sensei, I think I’m allergic to mornings.”</p><p>The classroom bursts into laughter, including Jesse, who realizes that this year is going to be filled with surprises.
