<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When Jesse and Yugo, who had an unexpected one-night stand, cross paths again, they must navigate the complexities of their intertwined lives as Jesse finds out that Yugo is a single father and his son happens to be Jesse’s student in the elementary school where Jesse works as a homeroom teacher.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This has been in my to-write lists for quite some time now, and I'm happy that I'm finally posting this bit by bit!</p><p>As usual, some notes:
</p><p>🧸: This is purely a work of fiction. Any actions by the characters do not reflect the idol and real-life personality of the idols involved.
</p><p>🧸: As Daigo is Yugo's brother in his fic, he goes by the surname Kochi.
</p><p>🧸: This fic will alternate points of view between Yugo and Jesse. So for Chapter 1, it will be Yugo's POV, then Jesse's POV for Chapter 2, and so on.
</p><p>That's all for now. Happy reading!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In the beating heart of Tokyo, high atop a Shibuya skyscraper, Yugo finds himself in a garden of laughter, light, and liquor. The rooftop bar hums with an eclectic mix of people, all there to unwind beneath a sequined sky. Yugo’s co-workers, a rowdy bunch of finance sharks, are swept away in the waves of whiskey and banter, but Yugo … he’s about as excited as a potato at a buffet.</p><p>“Come on, Kochi! Cut loose!” one of them nudges, waving a sloshing beer in his direction. He smiles politely, but inside he’s mapping out escape routes.</p><p>Just when he’s contemplating faking a text about a domestic emergency, his attention is captured by an attractive stranger at the adjacent table. The tall man has a smile as radiant as a sunbeam and a laugh that paints the air with joy.</p><p>The man returns his gaze with an inviting grin. His laugh punctuates the air, stirring something inside Yugo. He finds himself mirroring the man’s smile without thinking. But still, he quickly diverts his eyes, feeling a blush creep up his cheeks.</p><p>Heart pounding like a timpani, Yugo takes a gamble. He slips away to a corner, giving the scenic view a competition. The Tokyo skyline sprawls before him, neon lights winking through a veil of cherry blossoms. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots the man following him like a magnet.</p><p>“I’m Yugo,” he introduces himself as soon as the man stands beside him. “I … uh, work at a bank. Crunch numbers, you know.”</p><p>The stranger chuckles, extending a hand. “Jesse. I’m a teacher. I’m more into letters.”</p><p>Caught off guard by the man’s charm, Yugo stumbles over his words. “That’s, uh, different. Numbers, letters, huh?”</p><p>Jesse grins, nodding. “Yeah, quite the equation, huh? But don’t worry, I find you cute.”</p><p>Taken aback, Yugo blushes. He can’t recall the last time he’s flirted or even been flirted with. But as the night progresses, Jesse’s charm coaxes Yugo out of his shell. Laughter flows easily, the conversation laced with playful banter and shared smiles.</p><p>Beneath the dim lights of the bar and the spell of the Tokyo skyline, Yugo grows bolder. He matches Jesse’s playful touches, each one sending sparks up his spine. He’s tipsy, flustered, but oddly comfortable.</p><p>Under the twinkling city lights, Jesse leans in, his voice low and intoxicating. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stumbles over itself. He manages a nod, reaching for his phone to inform his brother of his extended “overtime.” He can hear Daigo’s laughter even through the text message, and he knows he’ll never live this down when he finds out what Yugo’s overtime actually meant.</p><p>He stands, swaying slightly as he presses a bold kiss to Jesse’s lips before pulling away, feeling a triumphant rush of adrenaline. “Lead the way, Jesse,” he murmurs, a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>As they make their way out of the bar, Yugo feels like he’s living in a dream, like he’s drifting on cloud nine. He steals a glance back at the bar, his co-workers still enraptured in their own world, none the wiser of his sweet escape.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Under the fluorescent glow of a love hotel sign, Yugo stands awkwardly, suddenly very aware of his sobriety. The blurred edges of the night have sharpened, and the weight of his responsibilities drops like an anvil on his mind. He’s a single father, for crying out loud, and his mind races with images of his six-year-old son, Takumi. Sure, his brother Daigo is babysitting, but what if something happens and he’s not there?</p><p>A hand on his shoulder brings him back to reality. Jesse frowns at him. “You okay?”</p><p>Yugo opens his mouth to tell Jesse about his worries, about Takumi. But he catches himself just in time. Telling a one-night stand about his child worries might not be the best topic of conversation. He settles for another truth. “It’s been a while since... well, you know.”</p><p>Jesse’s expression softens, and he takes Yugo’s hand, leading him inside. They enter the room that screams “cheap romance” with its heart-shaped cushions and satin sheets. Jesse settles onto a neon-purple couch, tugging Yugo onto his lap.</p><p>“If you feel uncomfortable, tell me, okay?” Jesse whispers, his breath warm against Yugo’s ear.</p><p>Yugo nods, the simple gesture making him feel better.</p><p>The kisses that follow are soft, hesitant at first, then growing passionate. As they lose themselves in each other, Yugo finds his worries melting away, replaced by a rush of desire. The taste of Jesse, the warmth of his skin against Yugo’s, the gentle exploration of hands — it all sends a whirl of heat through his body.</p><p>Time loses meaning as they move together, the rhythm of their hearts echoed in their movements. Jesse’s hands are everywhere, his touch sending waves of pleasure coursing through Yugo. His senses are filled with Jesse, the sight, the scent, the feel of him. It’s overwhelming and Yugo surrenders to the sensations, reaching the peak of his pleasure in a blaze of intensity.</p><p>As he lays in the aftermath, panting and satisfied, a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. Tonight, Yugo reminds himself, he can afford to let go of his responsibilities, just for a little while. Tomorrow, he’d be back to being the careful, loving father. But tonight, he’s just Yugo, a man enjoying a moment of wild abandon with a handsome stranger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the harsh morning light, Yugo comes to, his body pleasantly sore in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time. He squints against the sunlight filtering through the cheap blinds. His eyes wander over to the body beside him, Jesse, naked and fast asleep. As the memories of the night before hit him, Yugo’s cheeks color. That had been … quite the escapade.</p><p>His phone chooses that moment to beep, shattering the silence. It’s a text from Daigo, reminding him of his promise to take Takumi shopping. Yugo nearly chokes on his spit. He checks the time and his heart drops. He has less than an hour before Takumi wakes up, his tiny body filled with too much energy for a Saturday morning.</p><p>“Shit,” Yugo mutters, jumping off the bed, not caring about the fact that he’s as bare as a newborn. He hurriedly scavenges his clothes from the floor, throwing them on in record time. Shower? Who has time for that?</p><p>As he’s halfway through the door, Jesse stirs awake, blinking sleepily at Yugo. “Where are you off to?” he asks, his voice gruff from sleep.</p><p>Yugo freezes in his tracks. He doesn’t want to mention Takumi, so he lies. “Work emergency,” he says, gesturing to his crumpled suit. “You know how it is.”</p><p>Jesse rubs his eyes and nods. “Yeah, got it. Last night was fun.”</p><p>“Fun. Right,” Yugo says, managing a weak smile. “Thanks for … everything.”</p><p>With that, he dashes out of the room, leaving a sleepy Jesse in his wake. The things he does for his son, Yugo thinks, half-annoyed and half-amused. But as he races to make it home in time, there’s a part of him that can’t help but remember Jesse’s warm smile, the way he’d made Yugo laugh, the way he’d made Yugo’s toes curl with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Yugo enters his apartment, the warm smell of pancakes greets him. Daigo, chef’s hat askew and batter splattered on his apron, is in the kitchen, expertly flipping pancakes. “Takumi is still sleeping,” he says without looking up.</p><p>Nodding, Yugo tiptoes to his son’s room. Takumi’s asleep, cocooned in his spaceship-themed bedspread. The room is an organized chaos, full of half-assembled Lego sets, towering stacks of dinosaur books, and doodles of complex space machines. His heart swells with affection for the little genius. Where had the time gone? His baby is now a soon-to-be first grader.</p><p>“Time flies,” Yugo murmurs, ruffling Takumi’s hair lightly before leaving the room.</p><p>Back in the kitchen, Daigo pushes a glass of water and two aspirin towards him. “For your hangover.”</p><p>Yugo scowls. “I was at work.”</p><p>Daigo snorts, waving his phone in front of Yugo, a screenshot of a text he doesn’t remember sending on display. “So, ‘Work’ is a handsome man now?”</p><p>Yugo almost chokes on his aspirin. Sheepishly, he admits, “I might’ve … met someone.”</p><p>“Ha! I knew it! So, how was your ‘overtime’?” Daigo teases, pouring another pancake onto the griddle.</p><p>“It was … fun,” Yugo admits, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. “But I didn’t get his number.”</p><p>Before Daigo can pounce on that, the pitter-patter of small feet interrupts them. “Daddy!” Takumi’s voice rings out as he launches himself into Yugo’s arms. All worries and embarrassments are forgotten as Yugo pulls his son into a hug.</p><p>“Morning, buddy. Ready to get your school supplies later?” Yugo asks, ruffling his hair.</p><p>Takumi nods eagerly. “Did you have to work late again, Daddy?”</p><p>Yugo winces internally. “Yes, buddy. But I’m all yours today.”</p><p>As they have dinner, Yugo notices that Takumi has been staring at him strangely. But before he could ask, Takumi squints at something. “Daddy, why do you have a mosquito bite on your neck?”</p><p>Yugo’s heart stops.</p><p>A hickey.</p><p>Damn it, Jesse!</p><p>He glances at Daigo, who’s practically rolling on the floor, laughing. This was going to be a long day.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Jesse is sprawled on the living room tatami mats, scrolling through the list of first-grade names on his tablet. The room is a cozy fusion of traditional and organized chaos—reflective of its occupants. Stacks of teaching resources dot one corner, while children’s toys sprinkle the floor.</p><p>He loves his job with a fierce, underlying passion. However, tonight, two weeks before his first day as a homeroom teacher, it is love of a different kind that disrupts his thoughts.</p><p>The foreign sound of his phone breaks the serenity.</p><p>“Hello?” Jesse answers, not bothering to check the caller ID. His eyebrows knit in surprise when he hears the voice on the other end. “Taiga?”</p><p>Across the room, his older sister Aya looks up from her game of pick-up sticks with her daughter, Sakiko. Her gaze lands on Jesse, who has gone rigid, his jaw tight.</p><p>Taiga’s voice, melodic and familiar, fills Jesse’s ear. “Hey. I just got back from abroad. Fancy some sushi tonight?”</p><p>Jesse’s heart flutters; the memoriesn of their passionate college days, filled with academic rivalry and romantic trysts, surfacing like a breeching whale. He chuckles nervously. “I … Well, can I think it over?”</p><p>“Okay.” Taiga states the name of the restaurant and hangs up.</p><p>Jesse stares at his phone, the past suddenly resurrected in his hand. He blinks and turns to Aya. “That was Taiga.”</p><p>Aya lifts an eyebrow. “The ex-boyfriend, Taiga?”</p><p>“No, the Martians have learned our language,” Jesse retorts, rolling his eyes. “Yes, the ex-boyfriend, Taiga.”</p><p>“Hmm, and what did he want?” Aya asks, her eyes flashing with intrigue.</p><p>“To meet up, discuss the Pythagorean theorem, you know, the usual,” Jesse replies, tossing his phone onto a cushion.</p><p>“And you said?” Aya presses.</p><p>“I said I’d think about it.”</p><p>Aya’s eyebrows rise again. “And are you?”</p><p>“Am I what?” Jesse asks, his heart thumping a jazz rhythm.</p><p>“Thinking about it,” she states matter-of-factly. Sakiko giggles at something, and Aya instinctively grabs her daughter before she tumbles over.</p><p>“Maybe. I mean, I don’t know,” Jesse mumbles, rubbing the back of his neck. He joins Sakiko on the floor, ruffling her hair absentmindedly. “I don’t know what he wants.”</p><p>Aya watches Jesse thoughtfully before answering. “Then maybe you should find out. It should be closure or, I don’t know, a new beginning.”</p><p>Jesse snorts. “Listen to you, sounding all wise. I wonder why you don’t have a boyfriend.”</p><p>Aya laughs. “Because Sakiko doesn’t need a new dad.”</p><p>“Right!” Sakiko chirps, the word a well-timed punchline that sends the room into peals of laughter.</p><p>As the laughter subsides, Jesse glances at the phone again. He thinks of Taiga—the fiery arguments, the shared dreams, the whispered confessions in the dark. His gut clenches. One meeting couldn’t hurt, would it?</p><p>He picks up his phone again, stares at it for a long moment, then dials a number.</p><p>“One step at a time, Jesse,” Aya murmurs, her words a gentle anchor in the storm of Jesse’s emotions.</p><p>He looks up, nods, and takes a deep breath.</p><p>“Hey, Taiga. About that meeting …”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stepping into the vibrant restaurant, Jesse takes in the bustling scene. The aroma of sizzling tempura and the low hum of conversation mingle with the jazz notes wafting from an antique jukebox, a fusion of old-world charm and modern tech.</p><p>Taiga is waiting by the window, his face illuminated by the neon city lights streaming in. He’s as beautiful as ever, the passage of time only deepening his allure. As they embrace, Jesse can’t help but think that Taiga’s hugs are as warm as a <em>kotatsu</em> in winter. A wave of nostalgia washes over him, stirring up feelings he thought he had buried.</p><p>Dinner is a flurry of shared tempura and soft tofu, punctuated by the staccato rhythm of their chopsticks and the soft swish of sake. Taiga surprises Jesse when he reveals his new job, teaching elementary school kids at the same school where Jesse is working.</p><p>“You’re joking!” Jesse exclaims, nearly choking on his udon. “That’s my school!”</p><p>Taiga’s brows rise, surprise etching his stunning features. “I swear I had no idea! I just got the job, I start on Monday.”</p><p>Jesse frowns, eyeing Taiga skeptically, yet a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. “I always knew you secretly wanted to copy me.”</p><p>As the alcohol flows, conversation shifts to their love lives.</p><p>“Have you been seeing someone?” Taiga asks, clearing his throat.</p><p>“Been dating casually.” Jesse shrugs. He remembers his most recent one-night stand — a banker named Yugo, who Jesse regrets not getting his number. “You?”</p><p>“Same — just dating around, but nothing serious.”</p><p>“I wonder what might have happened if we tried long distance,” Jesse muses, swirling his glass.</p><p>Taiga’s expression softens, and for a moment, the restaurant buzz fades into the background. “Who knows?” he replies, a thoughtful look crossing his face. “Maybe we were too young, too ambitious.”</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted by the jukebox, playing a cheerful tune that contrasts with the somber note their dialogue had taken.</p><p>Jesse laughs, dispelling the tension. “But who can think of what-ifs when I have tempura and sake in front of me?” he exclaims, popping a piece of tempura into his mouth with an exaggerated expression of delight.</p><p>Taiga chuckles, and for a moment, it feels like they’re back in college, sharing a simple meal after a long day of classes. They lock eyes, the spark of old love flickering but not quite catching. The evening passes with laughter and stories, a chapter of their lives reopened, if only for a fleeting moment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Jesse and Taiga lose themselves in nostalgia, the restaurant staff’s discreet clean-up activities signal the end of the evening. “We should probably go,” Taiga suggests, looking somewhat reluctant to end the night. “I live close by. Wanna continue our conversation there?”</p><p>Jesse agrees, and soon they find themselves in Taiga’s apartment — a fascinating blend of sleek, modern lines and lush, tropical elements.</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “You’ve got plants? I remember you couldn’t even keep a cactus alive.”</p><p>“Cut me some slack, Jesse,” Taiga retorts, rolling his eyes playfully. “I’ve just moved in, and haven’t had time to redecorate. This was already a jungle when I arrived.”</p><p>As Jesse roams around, he spots an old photograph from their college days — two young men, laughing, oblivious to the world. The sight tugs at his heartstrings, awakening a flood of memories and emotions.</p><p>Suddenly, he feels Taiga’s arms wrap around him from behind. “I missed you, Jesse,” Taiga murmurs, his voice low and charged with emotion.</p><p>Jesse's breath hitches, their shared history echoing in his mind. “Are we … are we getting back together?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>“Let’s … let’s just catch up for now,” Taiga replies, his voice filled with hope and trepidation.</p><p>Then, in a surge of emotion, Jesse turns around and they share a slow and passionate kiss — a dance of familiarity and longing that makes Jesse’s heart flutter. But as their kiss deepens, Jesse pulls away, a sense of caution pulling him back to reality.</p><p>“We can’t … we can’t rush this, Taiga,” Jesse manages to say, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p>Taiga’s confusion is clear. “But you … you kissed me back.”</p><p>Jesse can’t deny it. He <em>did</em> kiss him back. But they’re high on old emotions, caught in a moment that’s both sweet and perilous. “We’re about to work together, Taiga. And this … this could make things complicated,” he admits. “Can we take things slowly?”</p><p>After a pause, Taiga reluctantly agrees. “Okay,” he says, disappointment seeping into his tone.</p><p>Jesse feels a pang of guilt, but he knows he’s made the right call. “Good night, Taiga. I’ll see you on Monday,” he says, bidding him farewell before stepping into the cool night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“So I left,” Jesse finishes. “Did I … did I do the right thing?”</p><p>In the heart of the apartment shared by Jesse and Shintaro, the dining room is a haven of creative chaos. Post-it notes with inspirational quotes dot the fridge. A sizable bookshelf stuffed with an eclectic mix of educational and philosophical texts occupies one wall. The table, more often than not, serves as a workstation, strewn with lesson plans, school memos, and half-finished cups of coffee.</p><p>On this morning, Jesse finds himself seated at the dining table, absently stirring his oatmeal while he recounts that evening with Taiga. Shintaro, despite being in the midst of a mad scramble to find his misplaced keys, offers his attentive ear.</p><p>Shintaro finally locates his keys, tucked behind a motivational plaque reading “Bless This Mess,” and breathes a sigh of relief. “Jess,” he begins, pouring himself a cup of coffee, “you know I’m all about living in the moment, but having sex with Taiga just for nostalgia’s sake, might not be the wisest decision.”</p><p>He takes a sip, then adds, “Working with him might get awkward if things don’t work out. You’re smart. You’re taking it slow.”</p><p>“But, what if—” Jesse starts, but Shintaro raises a hand, interrupting him.</p><p>“Just be open to the possibilities, dude,” Shintaro advises, leaning against the kitchen counter. “Maybe you and Taiga are meant to be, or maybe there’s someone else out there. Who knows?”</p><p>The mention of “someone else” evokes an image of Yugo in Jesse’s mind, causing his heart to flutter. He’d had several one-night stands, but somehow … he can’t forget his most recent one.</p><p>He pushes the thought away, focusing on his friend’s words as he takes a final spoonful of oatmeal. Shintaro’s right. Rushing into things with Taiga could make things messier.</p><p>A clatter from the kitchen brings Jesse back to reality. Shintaro, noticing the time, is hastily washing his dishes, splashing soapy water everywhere. “Hurry up with that breakfast, Jesse!” he yells over his shoulder. “We wouldn’t want you late for your first day as homeroom teacher.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the humming faculty room of the school, the hubbub quiets as the principal takes center stage. He begins introducing the new music teacher. Jesse, entering the room with the same perfect timing he uses to dodge questions about his love life, finds his eyes locking onto Taiga’s.</p><p>“Welcome to our team, Kyomoto-sensei!” the principal concludes, and the room erupts into polite applause. Jesse claps, too, his heart pounding like a drum solo.</p><p>As the meeting concludes, Jesse steels himself and walks over to Taiga. “Hey, are you mad at me?” he blurts out.</p><p>This earns him a sigh from his ex. “Jesse, you’re right,” he concedes, brushing a hand through his hair. “We should take it slow.”</p><p>Their conversation is cut short when Matsumura Hokuto, the dependable and pragmatic literature teacher, hovers on the desk next to Taiga’s. “Do you two know each other?” he asks.</p><p>“Same college,” Jesse replies, omitting the other details. “Hokuto, meet Kyomoto Taiga. He was my senior back in college. Tai—Kyomoto-san, meet Matsumura Hokuto. He teaches literature.”</p><p>Taiga gives Hokuto a small smile and a nod.</p><p>The bell chimes in the background, a call to arms for the teachers. “Well, nice meeting you, Kyomoto-san,” Hokuto says before striding off, a stack of literature textbooks under his arm.</p><p>Jesse’s first-grade classroom welcomes him with the smell of fresh paper and crayons, a realm decked in vibrant colors and cheerful drawings that he had labored over last Friday. His students trickle in, tiny bodies radiating nervous excitement.</p><p>“Hello, 1-B!” Jesse greets with a wide smile. “I’m Jesse Lewis, your homeroom teacher. But because my last name is hard to pronounce, you can call me Jesse-sensei! If you need anything, just let me know.”</p><p>The children respond with a chorus of “Good morning, Jesse-sensei!” their voices soft but filled with curiosity.</p><p>As Jesse starts roll call, he finds himself momentarily paused on a name. “Kochi Takumi,” he reads aloud, glancing up to meet a pair of intelligent eyes framed by thick-rimmed glasses.</p><p>Jesse squints at the boy. He feels an uncanny sense of familiarity but can’t put a finger on it. <em>Do I know him from somewhere?</em> he thinks, his eyebrows furrowed. <em>Did I teach his older sibling? Or perhaps, he looks like a celebrity?</em></p><p>The moment is cut short as Takumi confidently raises his hand and announces, “Jesse-sensei, I think I’m allergic to mornings.”</p><p>The classroom bursts into laughter, including Jesse, who realizes that this year is going to be filled with surprises. For now, he pushes aside his thoughts about the oddly familiar first-grader, focusing instead on the learning and laughter that lies ahead.</p>

<p>At half-past five, Yugo steps into the apartment. The space is a cacophony of his life’s bits and pieces. You have Daigo’s half-finished crossword puzzles strewn on the coffee table, Yugo’s meticulously organized files on the study desk, and Takumi’s colorful drawings stuck to the fridge with magnets.</p><p>The heady, savory scent of yaki udon envelops Yugo as he enters. Daigo, donned in a checkered apron that’s seen better days, bobs his head to the rhythm of a song only he can hear through his headphones. He stirs the pan of udon with a vigor that makes Yugo fear for their dinner.</p><p>On the couch, Takumi is buried under a mountain of picture books, the most prominent one being <em>Space Adventures</em>. Seeing Yugo, he beams and pops up like a toast from a toaster.</p><p>“Daddy!” He races towards Yugo, nearly tripping over a plush dinosaur in his path.</p><p>The hug they share is a refuge, a little island of calm in their boisterous household. Yugo breathes in the scent of Takumi’s shampoo, a soft sigh escaping him. “Hey, buddy!” He ruffles Takumi’s hair, smiling at the jumble of words that tumbles out of his son’s excited mouth. “How was school?”</p><p>Daigo, ever the interruption, calls them over to the kitchen. “Enough about school. Set the table. We’ve got a guest.”</p><p>“A guest?” Yugo looks at Daigo, eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Who?”</p><p>“Juri,” Daigo replies with a smirk. “Said he texted you but didn’t get a reply. Now he thinks I’m his new best friend.”</p><p>“Sorry, had a client meeting,” Yugo says, checking his phone to find a slew of unread messages from Juri. They are mostly GIFs and random memes, with a single question about dinner sprinkled in between. “Didn’t check my phone.”</p><p>Daigo just shrugs, stirring the udon and humming a catchy tune.</p><p>At the sound of the doorbell, Takumi bolts from his father’s side, charging towards the door. “Uncle Juri!” His face lights up with pure joy at the sight of Juri holding up a Lego set that’s probably going to turn their living room into a Lego battlefield.</p><p>“Happy first day of first grade, champ!” Juri booms, holding up the Lego set like a trophy, his broad grin matching Takumi’s.</p><p>Just as Juri’s about to dive into an elaborate play scenario involving the Lego, Yugo drags both his son and best friend to the dining table. It’s time for dinner, and in Yugo’s world, that means everyone sits down together, Lego adventures be damned.</p><p>The chatter over dinner is loud, boisterous, and filled with laughter. Takumi is animatedly discussing his first day in school, his eyes sparkling with excitement as he talks about his new friends and his favorite class — Science. Yugo can’t help the proud smile that spreads on his face as he listens to Takumi’s day. His mind makes a mental note about the field trip on the summer that Takumi just mentioned, resolving to pull some strings to get that day off.</p><p>“But what about your teachers, Takumi?” Daigo asks.</p><p>Takumi, who’s been shoveling the yaki udon into his mouth with gusto, pauses to consider Daigo’s question. “They’re all nice,” he says after swallowing. “But Jesse-sensei is the best!”</p><p>Yugo, who’s been reaching for a glass of water, chokes, eyes widening in surprise. <em>Jesse?</em> He sputters, water dripping from his mouth, as Juri pats him on the back. The name Jesse plays on repeat in his head.</p><p>But it can’t be one-night stand Jesse, right? What are the odds?</p><p>Juri looks concerned, eyebrows furrowed. “Yugo, you okay?”</p><p>Waving Juri off, Yugo coughs a few more times. “I’m fine. Just … wrong pipe,” he gasps out, pointing at his throat. He sees Daigo trying not to laugh, and Yugo shoots him a glare.</p><p>It’s a coincidence, Yugo tells himself, trying to suppress the sudden flurry of memories from that night.</p><p>It’s just a coincidence.</p><p>Right?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tucking Takumi into his bed that was more like a mini space shuttle, a cosmos mural painted across one wall and glow-in-the-dark stars stuck on the ceiling, Yugo marvels at the miniature universe that is his son’s room. Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes are scattered like ancient fossils, creating a time warp of prehistoric creatures in space.</p><p>“Wish you could be home early more, Daddy,” Takumi mumbles, clutching a stegosaurus to his chest as he fights off sleep.</p><p>His words, small and sleepy, feel like a sledgehammer to Yugo’s heart. “I know, buddy. I’ll do my best,” he promises, caressing his son’s cheek softly. It’s an exchange steeped in sincerity, a quiet heart-to-heart in the dim glow of a dinosaur-themed nightlight.</p><p>Once Takumi’s fallen asleep, Yugo wanders to their family shrine. The smiling face of his late wife, Haruka, greets him from her framed photo, a bittersweet reminder of shared joy and loss.</p><p>“You’d be so proud of him,” he whispers to her photo, a flicker of nostalgia lighting up his eyes. “He’s like a little Einstein … and he misses you. We both do.”</p><p>Then, he’s back in the living room, where the atmosphere is significantly lighter, Daigo and Juri already halfway through their six-pack. Juri, with a grin so wide it threatens to split his face, shoves a beer can towards Yugo. “We’re toasting to Takumi. For his first day at school.”</p><p>Yugo shares their toast. “You know …” he mumbles. “It’s funny. Takumi’s homeroom teacher is named Jesse.”</p><p>“And what about it?” Juri asks, an eyebrow raised.</p><p>He hesitates, but the words tumble out in a second. “I … kinda hooked up with a guy named Jesse a couple of weeks ago …”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Daigo exclaims, eyes wide. “Mr. Overtime?”</p><p>“Yes …”</p><p>“Excuse me, but this is new information to me?” Juri pipes up, forehead creased. “Yugo, you hooked up with someone?”</p><p>Yugo rolls his eyes and sighs, proceeding to share that night in Shibuya when he met this guy named Jesse and the night that followed. Daigo even showed to Juri his text lying about overtime, and Yugo wants nothing more than to shove his brother in the oven.</p><p>“What if that Jesse’s the same Jesse-sensei?” Juri asks, eyes twinkling mischievously.</p><p>“That would be <em>so </em>awkward, though,” Yugo groans, burying his face in his hands. “And to think I was planning to schedule a parent-teacher conference with him this week.”</p><p>“What for?” Daigo asks.</p><p>“I have to give them the head’s up so Juri can pick up Takumi after school in case the both of us aren’t free.” Yugo sighs. “Work’s been less hectic lately, and I want to do more for Takumi. But I guess this is what I can do for now.”</p><p>Daigo offers a reassuring nod. “You’re doing good, Yugo. One day, Takumi will get why you work so much.”</p><p>Yugo heaves a sigh, deciding to believe in his brother’s wisdom. He had always second-guessed himself these past six years, and for once, he wants to believe he’s doing something right. To be there more for his son, starting with a parent-teacher meeting, might be the next best move for now in this game called parenthood.</p><p>“So,” Juri clears his throat in an attempt to keep the mood light, “I bet you 5,000 yen that the homeroom teacher is Mr. Overtime.”</p><p>“Guess I’m devil’s advocate, and I’m making it 10,000 yen!” Daigo chimes in.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As Yugo races down the crowded streets, his mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and priorities. He’s just finished an out-of-office meeting, a credit analysis report is burning a hole in his briefcase, and his phone buzzes with unread emails. But right now, his primary concern is making it to his son’s school on time for a parent-teacher meeting.</p><p>As Yugo finally steps into the school yard, a feeling of nostalgic familiarity washes over him, tainted with the faint aroma of chalk dust and the sound of children’s laughter. He scans the playground, looking for his little bundle of joy, and sure enough, he spots Takumi walking out of the school building, surrounded by his friends and holding a stegosaurus toy, as if leading a tiny Jurassic expedition.</p><p>“Daddy!” Takumi calls out in surprise, his face lighting up.</p><p>“Hey, champ!” Yugo greets him, stooping down to receive a hug that feels like sunshine.</p><p>“You’re early! Did the bank robbers let you go?” Takumi’s words, making Yugo laugh. Yugo had once referred to his clients as “bank robbers,” and the designation stuck.</p><p>“Something like that. Listen, I need to speak to your teacher. Can you hang out with your friends for a bit?”</p><p>Takumi’s eyes grow wide, and he eagerly nods. “Okay! Are we still going to McDonald’s later?”</p><p>Yugo ruffles his son’s hair affectionately. “Of course. I promised you.”</p><p>Finding his way to the faculty room amidst the maze of classrooms, Yugo knocks on the door and prepares himself for what he thinks is a routine discussion about Takumi.</p><p>“Good afternoon, I’m here to see Mr. Jesse Lewis,” he announces, his voice echoing around the room.</p><p>And then he appears. Jesse Lewis. Out from the pantry, coffee in hand, steps the man Yugo spent a wonderful night with, not so long ago, in a rooftop bar in Shibuya.</p><p>Their eyes meet, and for a moment, the world comes to a standstill. Recognition flashes in their eyes, followed by the dawning realization of their predicament. A hilarious comedy of errors, life’s little prank.</p><p>Yugo’s one-night stand is Takumi’s homeroom teacher.</p>

<p>Jesse can practically feel the tension suffocating the small meeting room as Yugo walks in. The sudden revelation about Yugo being Takumi’s father has turned his already spiraling world upside down. Jesse quickly gestures to a seat across from him, a plastered smile on his face that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>“Would you like some tea?” he asks, a bit too cheerfully.</p><p>“Sure, thank you,” Yugo replies, looking more uncomfortable by the minute.</p><p>Jesse sets down a cup of steaming green tea in front of Yugo. Their hands almost touch, sparking a brief but intense moment of contact that sends Jesse’s heart racing. The familiarity of Yugo’s touch reminds him of their night together and the sparks that flew then. He quickly draws back, mentally shaking himself.</p><p>Jesse begins, his voice sounding strangely high in his own ears. “So, you left that morning because …”</p><p>Yugo interrupts. “I didn’t want Takumi to wake up without me there. I-I’m sorry I lied. Talking about being a dad to a one-night stand isn’t exactly a great topic of conversation.” His tone is apologetic, his eyes meeting Jesse’s, brimming with sincerity.</p><p>At least now Jesse understands. The mystery of the abrupt morning departure makes sense. He still feels the sting of being left, but understanding the context softens it a bit.</p><p>“And Takumi’s mother …” Jesse starts, noticing for the first time the absence of a wedding ring on Yugo’s finger. Now that he thought about it, he can’t remember if Yugo ever worn a ring when they first met. But then again, Jesse wouldn’t have approached Yugo if he saw a glimpse of a ring on his finger.</p><p>Yugo’s face changes subtly at the mention, a flicker of sadness passing through his eyes. “Haruka,” he says softly, his voice holding a deep reverence. “She passed away when Takumi was just one.”</p><p>Jesse’s heart lurches, an unexpected pang of empathy for Yugo. He hadn’t known. “I’m sorry for asking.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Yugo says with a sad smile. “It’s been five years. I miss her, of course, but I’ve come to terms with it.”</p><p>The conversation shifts to Takumi. Yugo’s face lights up when Jesse tells him about his son’s boundless curiosity and how his endless questions light up the classroom. Yugo even chuckles a bit when Jesse mentions Takumi’s particular love for space and dinosaurs.</p><p>“Does it become … annoying?” Yugo asks cautiously.</p><p>“Absolutely not!” Jesse bursts out. “It just shows that Takumi loves learning, and that’s never a bad thing.”</p><p>When Yugo eventually gets to the reason for his visit, Jesse is relieved. The meeting isn’t about their shared past; it’s about Takumi. It’s about Yugo giving them a head’s up of another one of Takumi’s guardians — Tanaka Juri, a travel agent with flexible work, and Yugo’s best friend and Takumi’s godfather. Juri would pick up Takumi from school if Yugo and Daigo, Yugo’s brother, wouldn’t be able to.</p><p>The paperwork is handed over, a photo of a jovial Juri attached. Jesse notes it down, relieved to have a semblance of normalcy return.</p><p>Finally, as Yugo stands to leave, Jesse blurts out, “I regret not asking for your number.”</p><p>Yugo blushes a little, a bashful smile playing on his lips. “You can find it in Takumi’s file,” he says. “But I guess you’re not going to text me for another round?”</p><p>Jesse sputters at that. “I-I guess not.” He feels a lump in his throat. He remembers the night with Yugo, the raw connection, and his heart stutters at the memory. But he forces it down, swallows the words he wants to say.</p><p>Instead, he replies, “I’ll contact you if I have concerns about Takumi. Though let’s hope that doesn’t happen.”</p><p>As Yugo steps out of the room, leaving behind a faint scent of his cologne, Jesse sinks into his chair. A sigh escapes his lips.</p><p><em>What a day</em>, he thinks, running a hand through his hair. <em>What a day, indeed</em>.</p><p>

</p><p>Jesse and Shintaro’s apartment buzzes with the faint aroma of teriyaki sauce as he pushes away a pile of school memos to make room for two steaming bowls of ramen. Across the table, Shintaro struggles to hold back laughter, nearly knocking over a half-finished can of soda in the process.</p><p>“So let me get this straight,” Shintaro finally manages between chuckles. “You end up having a one-night stand with a stranger, and that stranger turns out to be the father of one of your students?”</p><p>Jesse grimaces, stirring his ramen more forcefully than necessary. “Exactly.”</p><p>The apartment rings with Shintaro’s laughter, Post-its vibrating on the fridge at the force. “Dude, it’s like you’re the main character of a rom-com drama!”</p><p>“Except, this is my life,” Jesse retorts, lips curving upwards despite himself. He sips on his ramen broth, relishing its warmth before sighing. “This really complicates things.”</p><p>Shintaro sobers up, concern creeping into his voice. “What are you gonna do?”</p><p>Jesse glances at his hands, gripping his ramen bowl tighter. “I … don’t know. I feel an emotional connection with him, but my duty to my students comes first.”</p><p>With a smirk, Shintaro nudges Jesse’s shoulder. “Well, there’s always the tutoring center. They have an opening if you’re serious about pursuing Single Dad.”</p><p>Jesse splutters, shooting Shintaro a playful glare before chuckling. “You’re unbelievable!”</p><p>Shintaro grins, shrugging innocently. “Just looking out for my best friend.”</p><p>A moment of silence follows, filled only by the slurping sounds of ramen. Jesse finally speaks up, tone serious. “But, what about Taiga?”</p><p>Shintaro’s eyebrows knit together, a sharp contrast to his playful demeanor moments ago. “You guys agreed to take things slow to figure things out, right?”</p><p>Jesse nods. “Yes, but he has tried to get me alone after work a few times. I couldn’t even agree because of work.” Yesterday was because the principal called Taiga for a meeting, and this afternoon was because Jesse was with …</p><p>… well, Yugo.</p><p>“Jesse,” Shintaro says, leaning forward earnestly. “Remember, the school has rules about teacher-parent relationships. You need to be careful.”</p><p>“I know,” Jesse says, the weight of the situation pressing down on his shoulders. “I just … I just don’t know how to navigate this.”</p><p>Shintaro’s voice softens. “One step at a time, Jesse. You’re great at figuring things out.”</p><p>Jesse honestly hopes so. With some emotional connection with Kochi Yugo, his ex-boyfriend still having feelings for him, and navigating the challenges of being a homeroom teacher to first-graders, he feels like this is even more than a rom-com protagonist can handle.</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>
<br/>
</p><p>The last school bell rings, marking the end of the first week of the new academic year. Jesse, trying to sort out the jungle of lesson plans and student profiles on his desk, heaves a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Made it through week one,” he tells himself, feeling a strange mix of exhaustion and accomplishment.</p><p>Suddenly, a familiar figure fills the doorway of the faculty room. Jesse’s heart does a funny little flip as he recognizes Taiga.</p><p>“Hey, Jesse,” Taiga begins, leaning against the door frame with an air of nonchalance. “Fancy dinner tonight?”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes widen. “Dinner?” He remembers the last time they had dinner and how that almost lead to.</p><p>“I’ve noticed you’ve been avoiding me this week,” Taiga accuses, his tone a playful reproach. “Is it because I’m too irresistible?”</p><p>“Dream on, hotshot,” Jesse retorts, his eyes twinkling in amusement. “I’ve just been focused on surviving the first week of school, thank you very much.”</p><p>The corners of Taiga’s mouth twitch, obviously unconvinced. He opens his mouth to respond but is interrupted when Hokuto enters the room.</p><p>“Hey, everyone! Kyomoto hasn’t had his welcoming party yet!”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes narrow at Hokuto, but he turns on a smile as the principal walks in, clapping a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“A welcoming party it is then! How about tonight? It’s Friday, and we can afford to get drunk.”</p><p>The room fills with laughter and nods of agreement. Taiga shoots Jesse a glare that plainly says, ‘You owe me.’</p><p>“You and I,” Jesse whispers in Taiga’s ear as the commotion continues, “we’ll make an early exit. Promise.”</p><p>Taiga’s tense shoulders relax slightly, a teasing smile gracing his lips. “I’ll hold you to that, Jesse Lewis.”</p><p>Hours later, Jesse is trapped in a corner booth of a bustling izakaya, sandwiched between Taiga and a rowdy group of co-teachers tipsy from rounds of sake and beer. Taiga fires him a succession of quick glances and fleeting smiles, fingers brushing against his hand a tick longer than friendly.</p><p>The atmosphere is charged with nostalgia, unspoken words, and an awkward tension that Jesse is keenly aware of. He’s never been one to be flustered so easily, but Taiga has a way of throwing his rhythm off balance.</p><p>Suddenly, the principal, a jovial, rotund man in his late fifties, pipes up, tapping at his beer glass with a chopstick for attention. “I was just looking over Kyomoto’s file, and what a small world it is! Turns out, our new high school teacher and our beloved Jesse were college mates!”</p><p>Jesse chokes on his beer a bit, a spluttering mess for a moment. Clearing his throat, he grins sheepishly. “Yeah, we went to college together. Shared the same campus and all.”</p><p>His omission of their shared past isn’t lost on Taiga, whose smile fades ever so slightly, replaced by a quiet hurt in his eyes.</p><p>As the night rolls on, Taiga retreats into himself, nursing his drink with a sullen face, and no amount of Hokuto’s reasoning or the principal’s cheerful stories can bring him back. Hokuto, having consumed enough alcohol to derail his normally practical and logical self, descends into a verbal duel with Taiga about the intricacies of their teaching methodologies. Hokuto arguing for structure and tradition, Taiga pushing for innovation and flexibility, each viewpoint clashing with the other’s like waves against a rocky shore.</p><p>All the while, Jesse, blessed with a remarkable alcohol tolerance, sits as the eye of the storm, the only sober adult in a sea of drunken educators. His normally witty self is replaced by a responsible personality, making the decision to end the night early and escort Taiga home before he transforms into a full-blown broody mess.</p><p>Outside, as Jesse hails a taxi in the cool night air, Taiga breaks his silence.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell them about us, Jesse?” he asks, his voice a low whisper that only Jesse can hear.</p><p>Jesse sighs, running a hand through his hair. “Because it’s not that simple, Taiga,” he says, “Announcing our past to everyone might make things... complicated.”</p><p>Taiga scoffs. “And not acknowledging it simplifies things? What happened to taking it slow, getting to know each other again?”</p><p>His words hang heavily in the air, a silent accusation that makes Jesse’s heart ache. He doesn’t get a chance to reply, a taxi pulls up and he ushers Taiga into the backseat. Leaning in, he promises, “We’ll talk, Taiga. When you’re sober.”</p><p>With that, he closes the door, watching as the taxi disappears into the maze of the city’s streets. He is left standing alone in the cool night, the echoes of Taiga’s words lingering in his mind.</p>

<p>Yugo and Daigo’s tiny apartment currently reeks of beer, fried dumplings, and hilarious male camaraderie. Daigo takes up residence on their worn-out couch, noshing on leftover gyoza with the fervor of a man who just spent hours slaving away in a kitchen. He’s practically sprawled over Juri, whose sly grin betrays amusement as he takes another gulp of beer.</p><p>“It’s good to be home,” Daigo comments, punctuating the sentiment with a satisfied belch.</p><p>Yugo gives him a flat stare from the armchair. “Keep it down, will you?” he says, eyeing the closed door of Takumi’s room. “Takumi’s asleep.”</p><p>“Of course, brother dearest.” Daigo winks as he lounges comfortably. “So, spill the tea. What’s with that contemplative face of yours?”</p><p>Yugo takes a long sip of his beer, choosing his words. “I ran into someone at Takumi’s school … someone unexpected.”</p><p>“Unexpected how?” Juri queries, his interest piqued.</p><p>“You remember that guy I met at the bar in Shibuya weeks ago?” Yugo begins, inwardly cringing as he feels the heat rise in his cheeks. “Well, turns out he’s Takumi’s homeroom teacher.”</p><p>Laughter erupts in the room, with Juri barely managing to keep his beer from spilling while Daigo chokes on a dumpling. Yugo rolls his eyes but can’t stop a small smile from forming. Their laughter is infectious.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding!” Juri wheezes between chuckles, slapping Daigo on the back. “Jesse, was it? The one you were all dreamy-eyed about?”</p><p>“Firstly,” Yugo retorts, “I was not ‘dreamy-eyed.’ Secondly, yes. Jesse. The very same.”</p><p>Juri exchanges a knowing look with Daigo. “Daigo, I believe you owe me 10,000 yen.”</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Daigo interjects, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. “Are there sparks, Yugo? Still think he’s attractive?”</p><p>Yugo’s face grows even warmer, which he hopes is attributed to the alcohol. “He’s … not unattractive.”</p><p>“That’s not answering the question.” Juri grins.</p><p>Yugo groans, burying his face in his hands. “Fine, yes, he’s attractive. Happy now?”</p><p>“Are you gonna make a move?” Juri’s grin widens.</p><p>“No!” Yugo exclaims, horrified at the thought. “I can’t risk complicating things. Not for Takumi.”</p><p>Daigo nudges Juri, smirking. “Eye candy at parent-teacher meetings while looking for other prospective dates doesn’t sound too bad, Yugo.”</p><p>Yugo groans louder this time, wondering if it’s too late to return his brother or trade him for a new one. “I should have stayed at work.”</p><p>Amidst their roaring laughter and playful banter, Yugo shakes his head, a small smile on his lips. Even if they can be insufferable at times, these moments with Daigo and Juri always bring a sense of joy and normalcy that Yugo cherishes.</p><p>Even if they’ve just discovered his biggest secret and will undoubtedly tease him mercilessly about it for the foreseeable future.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo opens the door to find Takumi, immersed in a sea of LEGO bricks. His little fingers are working tirelessly, trying to connect the little pieces. The room vibrates with his intense concentration.</p><p>“Daddy,” Takumi calls without looking up. He pushes a small pile of LEGO bricks aside, creating a space for Yugo to sit. “I’m building a spaceship.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart feels as though it does a little flip inside his chest. He loves how his son’s imagination runs wild. Sitting down, he watches as Takumi’s brows furrow in concentration, fumbling with the tiny pieces. “Need a hand, buddy?”</p><p>Takumi looks at him with sparkling eyes. “I can’t decide how the wings should look. Can you help?”</p><p>Yugo nods, pushing up his sleeves and preparing for an intense session of spaceship designing. He never had an interest in space in his lifetime, but after one trip to the science museum that has Takumi talking about it non-stop, he finds himself reading random trivias and news reports about it, too.</p><p>As they delve into the world of interstellar travel, Takumi speaks up. “I want to make this my project for Science class,” he announces.</p><p>Yugo freezes, a LEGO piece in hand. The mention of ‘school’ leads to an involuntary Jesse thought. Yugo scolds himself, forcing the image of the attractive teacher away. “That’s a great idea, Takumi. Can I come see it?”</p><p>Takumi’s smile is wider than any planet they could ever hope to visit. “Really? Yeah!”</p><p>Yugo’s heart swells with happiness, but then, Takumi’s next question punches a hole through the euphoria.</p><p>“Dad, is Mom in space? Can we see her if we build a spaceship?”</p><p>The question hits Yugo like a rogue asteroid. It takes him a few seconds to recover. “I… I don’t know, Takumi,” he says, truthfully. “I don’t know if building a spaceship would let us see her.”</p><p>Takumi frowns, looking disappointed. “So, she’s not really in space?”</p><p>Yugo sighs, preparing to explain in a way that his son would understand. “No, buddy. Not in the way you're thinking. Space is far, far away. And it’s filled with many wonderful things, but I don’t think we can physically reach or see your mom there.”</p><p>He places a gentle hand on Takumi’s shoulder. “But that doesn't mean she isn’t with us, you know? We keep her in our memories, in our hearts, and in that way, she is always with us.”</p><p>Takumi’s silent for a while, his eyes glazing over. Then he whispers, “I miss her, Daddy.”</p><p>“I miss her too, buddy,” Yugo whispers back, wrapping an arm around Takumi, who snuggles into his side. “But you know what? We have each other, and we’ll always be there for each other, right?”</p><p>Takumi nods, his small body trembling. “You won’t leave me, right, Daddy?”</p><p>Yugo feels a lump in his throat. He kisses the top of Takumi’s head, making a promise he’ll always keep. “Never, Takumi. I love you.”</p><p>With a soft sigh, Takumi hugs him back. “I love you too, Daddy.”</p><p>Yugo gently untangles himself, wiping his damp eyes. “Come on, buddy. Let’s get you ready for bed.”</p><p>As Yugo leaves the room, he gives one last glance at the semi-constructed spaceship. He looks at Haruka’s altar before he retreats to his room, a silent prayer on his lips as he tries to hold back his tears.</p><p>The universe might be vast and unknown, but in this moment, it’s their tiny world of father and son that feels infinite.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo steps into his apartment, a soft sigh escaping his lips as he loosens his tie. The glow of the room is dim, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the refrigerator and Daigo’s tapping on his laptop.</p><p>“Food’s in the microwave. Leftovers from the pork <em>katsu</em> I made,” Daigo announces without looking up from his screen.</p><p>Yugo nods, peeling off his shoes before he makes his way to Takumi’s room, cracking the door open gently. His son is cocooned in his dinosaur-themed comforter, a soft snore the only indication of life. A feeling of warmth settles in Yugo’s heart. He closes the door quietly and heads for the kitchen.</p><p>Midway through his meal, Yugo’s eyes land on a sheet of paper by his plate. He picks it up, scanning through the lines. His heart stalls for a beat as his eyes land on a particular name — Jesse Lewis.</p><p>“What's this?” he asks, a lopsided grin on his face as he hides his surprise.</p><p>“Oh, that,” Daigo replies, his eyes twinkling with mischief. “Takumi handed it to me. His school needs parent volunteers for some fundraising event. You should sign up, Yugo. Get out there, socialize, make a good impression.”</p><p>“And why would I do that?” Yugo inquires, his eyes narrowing at his brother.</p><p>“Because you’re a single parent and you need to mingle more outside work. Besides”—Daigo points a finger at the paper—“isn’t that the name of your crush? You’ve been mumbling it in your sleep, you know.”</p><p>Yugo chokes on his rice. “I said he’s attractive, but I <em>do not</em> have a crush on my son’s homeroom teacher!” he retorts, his cheeks flaring up. He steals a glance at Jesse’s name again, the letters dancing before his eyes. “And I <em>definitely</em> don’t mumble his name.”</p><p>Daigo just laughs, shaking his head. “Whatever you say.”</p><p>Later that night, Yugo finds himself staring at the volunteer form, pen poised in his hand. “This is just about being a good parent, right?” he tells himself, his gaze landing on the space beside Jesse’s name.</p><p>With a shaky hand, he starts to write his name, trying to ignore the fluttering sensation in his stomach. Maybe, just maybe, he could allow himself this. Just for a bit.</p><p>And he was doing it for Takumi, of course. Absolutely not because of Jesse.</p><p>Definitely not.</p><p>His mind races with thoughts of Jesse’s laugh, his smile, the look in his eyes. Yugo shakes his head, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>This was ridiculous. <em>He</em> was being ridiculous.</p><p>“Get a grip, Kochi Yugo,” he mumbles to himself.</p><p>But the slight smile that lingers on his lips tells a different story.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The scent of chalk and crayons hits Yugo as he steps into the classroom. The screech of chairs against linoleum echoes through the air. A friendly-looking woman with her hair up in a ponytail sits by the window, her face toward the afternoon sun.</p><p>“Hello, for the fundraising meeting, right?” she asks, her voice carrying the warmth of a sunny afternoon. When Yugo nods, she continues. “I’m Omasa Aya.”</p><p>Yugo smiles, extending a hand. “Kochi Yugo. Nice to meet you, Omasa-san.”</p><p>She tilts her head, studying him. “You’ve got that look.”</p><p>“What look?”</p><p>“That ‘I’ve got a kid and I’m surviving on three hours of sleep and a gallon of coffee’ look.”</p><p>Yugo laughs, rubbing the back of his neck. “You’ve got that look too.”</p><p>“I’ve been at this for seven years. My little Sakiko keeps me on my toes.”</p><p>“Mine, too. He’s Takumi and he’s six years old. Single parent?”</p><p>“Yeah, we’re part of the exclusive club, I guess.”</p><p>Their words flow eventually with a rhythm that speaks of countless tales of raising their kids on their own. He can’t help but feel an instant connection to her, two lone parents navigating a sea of lunch boxes and field trip forms.</p><p>Just as Yugo is about to respond, the door swings open and in walks Jesse. Yugo watches as Jesse freezes, eyes wide. The words die on his lips as he catches sight of Aya.</p><p>“Jesse,” Aya greets, a trace of mischief in her tone. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p><em>Jesse?</em> Yugo glances at Jesse and back at Aya. There are no informalities in her speech.</p><p>Jesse’s eyes flit between Yugo and Aya. “Uh—no. I just—” He clears his throat. “Yu—Kochi-san, this is my older sister, Aya.”</p><p>Yugo’s brows shoot up in surprise. Aya, in contrast, only nods knowingly, an amusement dancing in her eyes. Yugo, feeling like he missed an inside joke, only gives her a polite nod. </p><p>A flurry of activity follows as the remaining parents and teachers stream in, their conversations layering into a loud buzz. Yugo takes a seat next to Aya, his gaze involuntarily trailing back to Jesse who is standing next to a shorter teacher with blonde hair and a face that would plaster him in fashion billboards, probably.</p><p>He later learns that the teacher is named Kyomoto Taiga, and he teaches music, his voice as melodic as the subject he’s teaching. Yugo notices that Taiga stands too close to Jesse as another teacher — Matsumura Hokuto — proceeds to discuss the fundraising event.</p><p>Yugo can’t help but notice the way Taiga’s hand casually rests on Jesse’s arm, with Jesse barely reacting. It’s as if there’s something going on between them—</p><p>His observation is cut short as Hokuto calls his attention.</p><p>“Kochi-san? Are you with us?” he asks, his eyes focused on Yugo as if he’s a student caught napping.</p><p>Yugo, a flush of embarrassment coloring his cheeks, looks up. “Yeah. Sorry … Just tired from work, that’s all.”</p><p>There’s a beat of silence and then Hokuto smiles in understanding. “It’s alright. I was just asking if you could help with the budgeting? I saw on your form that you’re a credit analyst.”</p><p>Yugo nods. “Yeah, of course.”</p><p>Hokuto nods and proceeds to talk to the other parents about fundraising assignments.</p><p>Yugo’s gaze unintentionally returns to Jesse. When his eyes meet Jesse’s across the room, Jesse’s bright smile dims slightly, replaced by a look of concern. A pang of confusion hits Yugo, his eyes narrowing at the puzzling exchange. He quickly looks away, focusing back on Hokuto, reminding himself that he’s volunteering for Takumi.</p><p>Definitely not for Jesse.</p><p>Yugo’s mind, however, has a habit of ignoring his reminders, especially when it comes to Jesse Lewis.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The playground is awash with the golden light of the sinking sun, the chatter of the children creating a symphony of joy. Yugo finds himself leaning against the school’s faded brick wall, watching as Takumi engages in an elaborate game of chase, dino-roars filling the air. His eyes flit to Jesse who is standing just a few feet away, his smile a silent testament to the love he harbors for his students.</p><p>“Kochi-san,” Jesse calls, approaching him with an easy grace. “Are you sure you’re okay with handling the finances for the fundraiser? There are other less demanding jobs out there.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, his eyes never leaving Takumi who’s now declared himself the king of dinosaurs. “Jesse … <em>sensei</em>, I work with bigger numbers every day. I’m sure I can handle this.”</p><p>Jesse nods, the light catching in his hair. He joins Yugo, his gaze mirroring his attention on the children. “They have such an amazing imagination,” he muses, a wistful tone creeping into his voice. “That’s what I love about teaching, watching them discover and explore without any inhibitions.”</p><p>A bubble of laughter escapes Yugo. “It’s all fun and games until an imaginary dinosaur demands cookies at three in the morning.”</p><p>Jesse’s laughter rings out, a warm sound that pulls at Yugo’s heartstrings. But he brushes that feeling aside. After all, he was just here as a parent.</p><p>Suddenly, a soccer ball hurtles towards them. Before Jesse can do more than gasp, Yugo, with his father-honed reflexes, reaches out and catches it. His chuckle is laced with amusement as he hands the ball back to a grateful child.</p><p>“Your face, <em>sensei</em>,” he teases as he glances at Jesse, “you looked like you were having a ‘near-death’ experience.”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes, but there’s a smile playing on his lips. “Well, excuse me for not expecting an attack.”</p><p>Their laughter fades into a comfortable silence when Taiga makes his presence known, striding towards them with a coffee cup in hand and a fixed smile on his face. However, Yugo notices that his smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>“Kochi-san.” He nods at Yugo in greeting, his tone casual, but the tension in his eyes giving him away. “Jesse.” His expression relaxes. “I was thinking we could check out that new Thai place this weekend. You in?”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes flicker to Yugo briefly before returning to Taiga. “Actually,” he begins, “I was thinking of spending the weekend catching up on grading.”</p><p>Taiga waves away his concerns, a smirk on his face. “Grading? At your place? Come on, Jess, don’t be such a workaholic. We can do that at my apartment,” he suggests nonchalantly, almost teasingly. “You <em>do</em> remember you used to spend time at my apartment, right?”</p><p>“Taiga!” Jesse hisses, his cheeks flushing a light pink. He throws a quick, almost nervous glance at Yugo before relenting. “Okay, okay. That sounds … fine.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart sinks. He wasn’t one to jump to conclusions, but this... this was an indication of a relationship that went beyond mere friendship. The thought of Jesse with Taiga sends a jolt of something he could only describe as jealousy through him.</p><p>Taiga’s satisfied smirk broadens as he takes a triumphant sip of his coffee and saunters on.</p><p>Jesse looks like he's about to explain, but Yugo raises a hand to stop him, his face a mask of icy composure. “It’s none of my business, <em>sensei</em>. You’re Takumi’s teacher and I’m his father. That’s all there is to it.”</p><p>He then calls out to his son, who's still running about, pretending to be a dinosaur. “Takumi, it’s time to go home.”</p><p>As they tread their familiar path home, the fading day reflected in the long shadows stretching across the sidewalk, Takumi looks up at Yugo. The young boy’s eyes are filled with concern as he takes in his father’s unusual quietness. “Daddy, are you okay?” he asks, his voice wobbling with worry.</p><p>Yugo manages a weak smile, ruffling Takumi’s hair gently. “I’m okay, Takumi. Just tired from work.”</p><p>Takumi studies Yugo, not quite believing his father’s words. But instead of voicing his doubts, he simply stops in his tracks, tugging at Yugo’s sleeve to make him kneel down. Wrapping his small arms around his father, he gives him a comforting squeeze. “Jesse-<em>sensei</em> says hugs make things better,” he mumbles into Yugo’s shoulder.</p><p>Yugo can’t help the bitter irony that stings at the mention of Jesse’s name, but he suppresses the sigh that threatens to escape. He tightens his arms around Takumi, burying his face into his son’s soft hair. “Yeah, they do,” he agrees quietly, realizing that despite the knot of unpleasant emotions unraveling within him, this hug from his son does bring a sense of comfort, a grounding reality check.</p><p>Lost in the warm embrace of his child, he can’t help but wonder why he is even seeking romantic love in the first place. Love has always been painted as this grand, dazzling experience, but it also came with its share of pain, confusion, and disappointment.</p><p>And as he holds his son close, he realizes that he already has the purest form of love right in his arms. A love that’s unconditional, innocent, and untainted by the complexities of adult relationships.</p><p>He decides, at least for now, that maybe, just maybe, this is enough.</p>

<p>The setting sun drapes a soft, golden glow on the apartment. The whole place is buzzing with life and warmth, a complete 180 from their usual weekday dinners of instant ramen or takeout pizza. Today, it’s Aya who commandeers the kitchen. Sakiko bounces around in her colorful pinafore, dolling out innocent yet sharp quips that fills the room with laughter.</p><p>“Uncle Jesse.” Sakiko tugs at his shirt. “Why do you always eat noodles?”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, exchanging a knowing look with Shintaro. “Well, Sakiko, it’s because your Uncle Jesse can’t cook.”</p><p>“Except scrambled eggs,” Shintaro adds, popping a cherry tomato in his mouth. “He makes decent scrambled eggs.”</p><p>Jesse shoots Shintaro a good-natured glare. “Can you not disclose all my secrets in one night, Shin?”</p><p>Dinner is a noisy affair, filled with playful banter, sizzling sounds from the kitchen, and Sakiko’s ceaseless chatter. The apartment hasn’t been this lively in weeks, and Jesse can’t help but feel a tinge of nostalgia. But there’s also a gnawing discomfort, a knot in his stomach that refuses to unravel.</p><p>Aya, ever the perceptive sister, picks up on his unease. “What’s the matter, Jesse?” she asks as she stirs the pot of curry. “You seem a bit off tonight.”</p><p>Jesse smiles, trying to play it off. “Just tired from the meeting earlier.”</p><p>“I see,” Aya presses, her gaze not leaving the curry. “Was it because I was talking to Kochi-san?”</p><p>Jesse’s heart twinges at the mention of Yugo’s name, a feeling he’s not quite accustomed to yet. “No, it was something else,” he admits, avoiding her gaze.</p><p>“And?” Shintaro prods, a smirk playing on his lips. “How did it go?”</p><p>Jesse sighs, recalling the afternoon’s events. Everything was going well until Taiga appeared, throwing everything off balance. Yugo’s sudden coldness left him with a sour taste in his mouth. It felt like a bucket of icy water dumped over the budding hope he had started to harbor.</p><p>“It was … complicated,” he admits at the end.</p><p>Shintaro scratches his head. “Do you think Kochi-san’s jealous?”</p><p>“I don’t want to assume,” Jesse confesses. “I just … I felt a sting when he started acting cold.”</p><p>Aya rests a hand on her brother’s shoulder. “I think you should at least deal with your relationship with Taiga first. And then worry about Kochi-san after.”</p><p>Jesse shrugs. “I understand, but ...” He groans and scratches the back of his head. “Ugh, why is this hard?”</p><p>Silence fills the room before Sakiko’s voice rings out from the room. “Adults are so complicated! Just talk to him, Uncle Jesse!”</p><p>A moment passes before all three adults burst into laughter, the tension dissipating in the apartment. Sakiko’s innocent yet insightful comments, a delightful reminder that amidst their adult complications, sometimes the simplest solutions come from the unlikeliest places — a seven-year-old girl’s wisdom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the heart of Taiga’s apartment, the natural light spills onto the open space designed like a tropical island getaway. The smell of timber mingles with the crisp aroma of fresh papers, creating an ambiance that’s almost as confusing as Jesse’s emotions. Taiga, looking like a misplaced beach model in the midst of brick and timber, is perched on a stool, grading papers.</p><p>“Can’t believe you’re still so by-the-book,” Jesse says, shaking his head as he observes Taiga’s neat, methodical system of paper-grading: organized by class section, names in alphabetical order, and with precise feedback.</p><p>“And I can’t believe you’re still so … well, you,” Taiga shoots back, his lips quirking in amusement as he glances at Jesse’s more chaotic style, his papers scattered around him as his pens personalized, empathetic feedback for each student.</p><p>Jesse can’t help but smile. He watches Taiga’s concentration as he grades papers, his eyebrows furrowed. Jesse remembers the days in college when they’d study together, Taiga always lost in his own world of intellect. Jesse once loved this sight, but now, he finds the emotional torrent within him more jumbled than his pile of papers.</p><p>Caught off guard when Taiga suddenly looks up, Jesse hurriedly refocuses on his papers. “Lost in thoughts, Jesse?” Taiga smirks. “You used to stare at me like that before I’d lean over for a kiss.”</p><p>Jesse sputters. “No, thank you. Let’s just focus on grading.”</p><p>Undeterred, Taiga sets his papers aside, leaning back with a sigh. “You’re always running away, Jesse. You can’t keep hiding in your shell, making self-deprecating jokes.”</p><p>“Well, you’re not exactly a saint yourself, Taiga,” Jesse mutters, his eyes darting to the side, remembering the sight of Taiga interrupting his conversation with Yugo after the meeting.</p><p>Taiga laughs, a harsh sound that resonates around the apartment. “So, that’s what it is. You’ve got the hots for that single dad! As if you have a chance.”</p><p>Jesse, usually composed, snaps, the sting of Taiga’s words hitting home. “You just can’t stand someone else taking the spotlight, can you?” Jesse spits out, feeling his blood boil. “Maybe I do like Kochi-san, and maybe I have no chance, but I’d rather admire him from afar than get back together with you!”</p><p>The words hang heavy in the air, followed by an eerie silence. Taiga stares at Jesse, his expression hard and eyes filled with a boiling mix of anger and hurt. “Get out,” Taiga growls, the hurt in his eyes making Jesse’s heart ache.</p><p>Jesse nods, pushing away from the table, his chair scraping the wooden floor. With a last, pained look at Taiga, Jesse walks out of the door. As he steps out, he tastes the bitter regret of his words, but he knows there’s no turning back now.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Monday rolls around like a particularly sassy tumbleweed, and it’s as if the building itself is aware of the tension between him and Taiga. Every glance, every interaction with Taiga feels as icy as the overpriced gelato the principal once raved about, and Jesse can’t ignore the way Taiga keeps himself at a professional distance.</p><p>“Can we grab lunch?” Jesse ventures, bracing for a possible brush-off.</p><p>Sure enough, Taiga gives him a wide-eyed glance and a dismissive shake of his head. “Can’t. Duty calls. Matsumura and I are swamped with paperwork.” Taiga turns on his heel, dragging an unsuspecting Hokuto along with him.</p><p>The sight is comical enough to make Jesse laugh, though. Who would’ve thought? Taiga and Hokuto eating lunch together?</p><p>By the time the final bell rings, Jesse finds himself defeated and a little deflated, surrendering to the idea of giving Taiga the space he apparently needs. He can’t help but get lost in the labyrinth of ‘what if’s, trying to map out potential scenarios in his head about their possible future relationship … or absence of it.</p><p>“<em>Sensei</em>?”</p><p>A high-pitched voice pulls Jesse out of his thoughts. He looks down to see Takumi, his eyes wide and full of questions.</p><p>Jesse can’t help but smile at the innocence of the child. “Sorry, Takumi.” He rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. “I was spacing out.”</p><p>Takumi squints, his small hand reaching out to pat Jesse’s hand. “You look sad. Did someone steal your lunchbox?”</p><p>The question sends Jesse into a fit of laughter. “No, Takumi, nobody stole my lunchbox. I just had a fight with my friend.”</p><p>Takumi nods solemnly. “Daddy says when I do something wrong to my friend, I should say sorry and talk about it.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “It sounds so easy when you say it like that, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Before they can continue their conversation, a familiar figure at the gate catches Takumi’s attention. Jesse turns to see a man strolling in — he recognizes him in Takumi’s file as Kochi Daigo, Yugo’s younger brother. There’s a carefree grin plastered on his face as he waves at Takumi.</p><p>“Who’s that, Takumi?” Jesse asks, feigning ignorance.</p><p>“That’s Uncle Daigo!” Takumi’s face lights up, but it falls as quickly as it had appeared. “Daddy can’t come today.”</p><p>As Daigo nears, he stretches out a hand to Jesse. “So you’re the famous Jesse-<em>sensei</em>.” He grins, his eyes twinkling with mischief as Jesse grasps his hand and shakes it. “My brother’s told me a lot about you.”</p><p>Jesse, caught off-guard, feels his cheeks flush. “Well, I hope it’s all good things.”</p><p>As they wrap up their conversation, Daigo hands Jesse a flyer before walking away, a cheeky grin on his face. “I’m selling cupcakes at the weekend street market this Saturday. I hope you’ll come.”</p><p>Jesse is left standing there, the flyer burning a hole in his hand. His mind whirls with thoughts, the most prominent one being the hope that Yugo might be there too.</p><p>It’s a silly hope, Jesse knows. And he knows that after last week, Yugo might just treat him as just his son’s teacher. But he’s always been a bit of a dreamer, after all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse soaks in the sensory symphony of the vibrant street market, his heart echoing the beats of commerce and camaraderie. However, it’s the cupcake stand that entices him the most, not for its sugary delights but the presence of the man behind it.</p><p>“Jesse, pull yourself together,” he mumbles to himself as he approaches the stand, battling the battalion of butterflies in his belly.</p><p>“<em>Sensei</em>!” Daigo’s call breaks through the marketplace’s hum, a mischievous grin plastered on his face as he nudges Yugo.</p><p>Yugo swivels around, and Jesse feels his heart drum a staccato rhythm against his ribcage. Their eyes lock, an electric connection lingering in the air.</p><p>However, before Jesse can even attempt a response, his gaze shifts to a lean man standing suspiciously close to Yugo.</p><p>Jesse recognizes the man as Tanaka Juri, who Yugo has given authority to pick Takumi up after school if Yugo and Daigo can’t. He recalls that Tanaka Juri is Takumi’s godfather and Yugo’s best friend, but the way they’re close shows they could be more than that …</p><p>Juri is mid-laugh, his chuckles echoing through the air. Jesse watches, his heart sinking like a stone in a pond. He manages to keep his face neutral, hiding the disappointment beneath a polite smile.</p><p>Juri looks at him gleefully like a kid presented with a bowl of candy. “I’m Tanaka Juri. Known this guy for ages”—he gestures at Yugo with his thumb—“And I’m also Takumi’s godfather.” Wrapping an arm around Yugo’s shoulders, he adds a playful wink at Jesse.</p><p>Jesse blinks, fighting back a surge of unreasonable jealousy. “Ah, so you two are … close?” He lifts an eyebrow, his voice squeaking slightly.</p><p>“Like two peas in a pod,” Juri confirms with a nod, giving Yugo’s shoulder an exaggerated squeeze.</p><p>Yugo, oblivious to the comedic tragedy unfolding, only offers an amused smile, clearly used to Juri’s antics.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a parallel universe untouched by adult drama, Takumi tugs at Jesse’s sleeve, pointing at the cupcakes with childlike wonder. “Jesse-<em>sensei</em>, look!” He pulls Jesse down to his level.</p><p>Jesse gratefully seizes the distraction, forcing his attention away from the confusing array of emotions threatening to capsize him. “Oh wow, Takumi,” he says, following Takumi’s gaze. “Those do look delicious. Which one do you want?”</p><p>The answer is lost in the wind as Jesse’s mind snaps back to Yugo and his ‘boyfriend.’ With a sigh, he quips to himself, “I’ve accidentally walked into a rom-com. Just my luck.”</p><p>As he stands amidst the confusion, his gaze still strays back to Yugo. Taking a bite of the cupcake, he finds some solace in its sweetness, a sprinkle of joy in the midst of this chaos.</p><p>Jesse had thought he would just buy a box of cupcakes and go, but soon, Daigo is dragging him to a food truck nearby for lunch. Yugo is on his heels, Juri is tagging along with a nonchalant grin, and Takumi, holding hands with both Yugo and Juri, chatters away excitedly.</p><p>They all stand together in line, waiting to place their orders. The scent of sizzling bibimbap and the sight of colorful side dishes have Jesse’s mouth watering. He watches, amused yet envious, as Yugo and Juri listen attentively to Takumi’s chatter, a private bubble of camaraderie around them. A pang of longing throbs within him as he watches their interaction. He’s not sure if it's the smell of kimchi or the sight of Yugo’s gentle smile that’s making his stomach churn.</p><p>“Hey, <em>sensei</em>, you’re spacing out there,” Daigo interrupts, nudging Jesse.</p><p>“I’m just … hungry,” Jesse replies.</p><p>“Sure, for food or for my brother?” Daigo teases, grinning.</p><p>Jesse’s face turns an impressive shade of red as he sputters out a denial. Daigo only laughs, clapping him on the shoulder before moving ahead to place his order.</p><p>When it’s Jesse’s turn to order, he rattles off his choices, but as he reaches for his wallet, Yugo steps in, wallet in hand.</p><p>“I got this,” Yugo says.</p><p>“No, I can pay for my own food,” Jesse protests, but Yugo’s quick.</p><p>“It’s my treat,” Yugo insists. “For visiting Daigo’s stall.”</p><p>A disgruntled voice from behind interrupts them, “Take your lover’s spat elsewhere. Some of us are trying to eat.”</p><p>Heat crawls up Jesse’s neck, and he surrenders the argument, allowing Yugo to pay, while he moves aside, trying to ignore the smirks from Daigo and Juri. As he waits for his order, Yugo joins him, an apologetic smile on his face.</p><p>“Look, Jesse,” he begins, then clears his throat. “<em>Sensei</em>. There’s nothing going on between me and Juri.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask,” Jesse retorts.</p><p>Yugo sighs, running a hand through his hair. “He’s my best friend. He’s been there through thick and thin while I was raising Takumi on my own.”</p><p>Jesse softens. “Yeah, I think I get that. My sister and I were close enough, but we became inseparable when I had to help her raise Sakiko on her own. I guess there’s something about staying up at three in the morning to put a baby to sleep that keeps us together.”</p><p>Yugo laughs at that. “I guess so.”</p><p>They were interrupted when the waiter delivers their orders. They collect the trays and head back towards the others. Jesse watches the way Yugo’s eyes soften when he talks about Takumi, his heart pounding in his chest like a schoolboy with a crush.</p><p>“Also”—Jesse clears his throat as they near—“I want to clarify that Taiga … Kyomoto-<em>sensei</em> … and I broke up years ago. So, there’s nothing going on between us.”</p><p>He sees Yugo’s eyes light up with an unreadable emotion, and a hint of a smile flickers across Yugo’s face. The sight of it sends a jolt of warmth through Jesse’s heart, making him smile to himself as they sit down to enjoy their meal amidst the laughter and chatter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sun casts long shadows across the faculty room as Jesse finally corners Taiga, after days of polite, though palpable, avoidance.</p><p>“Taiga,” Jesse starts, hoping his voice isn’t as shaky as he feels. “Walk home with me?”</p><p>Taiga, leaning against a desk, eyebrow raised, finally meets Jesse’s eyes and, after a heart-stopping pause, nods. “Sure, Jesse.”</p><p>The relief almost makes Jesse’s knees buckle. They grab their coats and head out, walking side by side in comfortable silence, the cool breeze of the evening making the leaves in the trees rustle like whispers.</p><p>They reach a quiet park, the setting sun casting a warm orange glow that paints everything in surreal shades. Jesse steers them towards an isolated bench, a quiet spot away from the playful yells of children and the distant hum of traffic. They settle down, the silent tension hanging heavy between them.</p><p>Jesse takes a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. “Taiga,” he starts, glancing at the other man. “I meant what I said before. About wanting to get to know you again. But that doesn’t necessarily mean–“</p><p>“You want to get back together,” Taiga finishes for him, his gaze on the setting sun. “I figured as much.”</p><p>“I’m sorry if I led you on,” Jesse quickly adds, his heart pounding in his chest. “Especially with what happened when we first saw each other again.”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, a sad smile playing on his lips. “I wanted that kiss, Jesse,” he admits. “And when you kissed me back … I thought, maybe we could get back together.”</p><p>“I wasn’t thinking. I missed it, but it was driven by nostalgia. I’m sorry, Taiga,” Jesse repeats, his chest aching with a confusing mix of relief and regret.</p><p>Taiga shrugs, his gaze finally moving from the sunset to meet Jesse’s eyes. “You like Takumi’s dad a lot, don’t you?”</p><p>Jesse’s cheeks turn a bright shade of red, and he fumbles for a response, finally settling for a simple “Yes.”</p><p>A moment of silence passes before Taiga speaks, his voice full of bitter amusement. “I think he got a bit jealous when I made that comment. So, I guess you’ve got a chance with him.”</p><p>Jesse wants to hope, but it’s just so complicated now. “And what about you, Taiga?” he finds himself asking instead, a teasing smile on his face despite the heavy conversation. “Did you get close to Hokuto?”</p><p>Taiga scoffs, rolling his eyes. “Matsumura? No way. I drag him to lunch to spite you, but we can’t stand each other for more than five minutes. Can’t agree on anything.”</p><p>Despite the tense situation, both of them share a laugh, the sound echoing in the quiet park. The setting sun casts long shadows across their faces, and for a moment, it’s like they’re back in college, young, hopeful, and carefree.</p><p>The echoes of their laughter gradually fade away, leaving behind a comfortable silence. They sit there until the sun finally sets, lost in their own thoughts, their shared history a bittersweet melody playing in the background.</p><p>As they get up to leave, Jesse feels a strange sense of closure. They’re not the same people they were back in college, and maybe that’s okay. Life goes on, and they’ve got their own paths to follow. But for now, Jesse takes comfort in the fact that, even if they can't be together, they can still share a quiet sunset and a good laugh.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A cacophony of key strokes fill the Kochi apartment, an odd symphony for two in the morning. Yugo sits hunched at the dining room table, his focus entirely on the lit screen before him, a digital scroll of numbers, calculations, and financial predictions. There’s a certain stillness to the room, a tranquility that one might equate to peacefulness, if not for the fact that Yugo really should be in bed.</p><p>Suddenly, a voice pierces through the silence, injecting a sudden lively energy into the scene. It’s Daigo, his footsteps echoing off the wooden floors as he steps out of his room.</p><p>“Yugo, you’re still up?” he asks, rubbing his eyes in disbelief, as if the sight of Yugo at the table at this ungodly hour is more unsettling than a mid-night earthquake.</p><p>Yugo glances at the digital clock at the corner of his laptop screen — two in the morning. “Yeah, just wrapping up some work,” he says, his voice hoarse from lack of use. “I’ll grab two cups of coffee in the morning and I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Daigo chuckles. He moves closer, peering over Yugo’s shoulder at the avalanche of numbers. “This doesn’t look like work. It looks more like a Sudoku puzzle from hell.”</p><p>Yugo can’t help but crack a smile. “It’s the budget for the school’s family fun day. Couldn’t finish it at work. You know how it goes,” he says, shrugging.</p><p>His admission seems to trigger something in Daigo. His brows furrow and he sighs, shaking his head. “Yugo, you work too hard,” he says. “You know you deserve some rest too, right?”</p><p>“I know,” Yugo murmurs, his fingers pausing over the keys for a moment. It’s not like he isn’t aware of his workaholic tendencies, but acknowledging it is another thing entirely.</p><p>Unfazed by Yugo’s taciturn response, Daigo smiles and moves towards the kitchen. “How about some soup before bed?” he suggests, already reaching for the pot.</p><p>For a moment, Yugo just looks at his younger brother, his heart filled with gratitude. He may be the elder, but Daigo often seems to understand him better than he understands himself. “Thanks, Daigo,” he murmurs, returning his focus back to the screen.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the afternoon sun paints the classroom in hues of gold, Yugo finds himself sitting in another meeting with teachers and parent volunteers, the remnants of chalk dust and childhood enthusiasm lingering in the air. Though his body is there, his mind is running on the fumes of many late nights at work, and his eyes have taken on a glazed look that suggests he’d rather be anywhere else.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he notices Aya leaning towards him with a look of concern. “Are you okay?” she whispers, her voice barely audible above the chatter in the room.</p><p>“Yeah, just long hours these past few days,” he replies with a shrug, forcing a smile.</p><p>Aya’s worry isn’t the only one directed towards him, he notices. There’s also a look of concern from Jesse, one that he hastily ignores, not wanting to fuel the flames of his feelings for the man who teaches his son.</p><p>Jesse excuses himself from the room, leaving Yugo with the haunting sight of his retreating back. He forcibly turns his attention back to the meeting, resolutely ignoring the way his heart aches with longing.</p><p>As the meeting draws to a close, Jesse reappears, bearing the announcement of free coffee and tea in the classroom next door. The room fills with murmurs of approval, and bodies start to move towards the promised caffeine.</p><p>Yugo, ready to join the exodus, halts when Jesse approaches him, a steaming cup of coffee in his hand. “You look like you could use this,” he says softly.</p><p>Yugo’s heart skips a beat as he takes a cup from Jesse, their fingers brushing briefly. He stutters a thank you, feeling the warmth from the cup spread to his cheeks.</p><p>The classroom is now emptier, leaving Yugo with Taiga, Jesse’s ex-boyfriend. He meets Taiga’s gaze, expecting the usual hostility, but instead receives a polite smile and a nod. Taiga then motions for Hokuto to follow him out, leaving Yugo once again alone with his thoughts.</p><p>As if on cue, Aya sidles up next to him, her curiosity piqued. “Have you ever thought about dating these days?” she asks, her tone casual.</p><p>Caught off guard, Yugo stammers out as a response. “It’s hard … with work and … and Takumi.”</p><p>Aya chuckles, her laughter echoing in the near-empty classroom. “I get it, dating as a single parent is hard,” she says, shaking her head. “But I wouldn’t say no to love when the opportunity comes knocking.”</p><p>Her words hang in the air between them, and Yugo can’t help but glance at Jesse, his laughter reaching him even in the adjacent room. His heart flutters, and he can’t help but wonder what it would be like to be brave enough to say yes to love, without the fear of the consequences.</p><p>For a fleeting moment, his tiredness seems to fade away, replaced by a warmth that had nothing to do with the coffee in his hand. He’s too exhausted to dissect his feelings now, but one thing’s for sure — these meetings are never as simple as they seem.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s the day of the family fun day at school, and Yugo wakes up with an unusual chill crawling under his skin, a surefire sign of an impending fever. He winces as he sits up in bed, feeling as if his body is wrapped in a heavy, cold blanket. Shivering, he reluctantly peels the covers off and plants his feet on the floor.</p><p>It’s just a little fever, he tries to convince himself. He can push through it. After all, he’s survived board meetings with far more unpleasant conditions. The corners of his mouth twitch into a small smile at the thought.</p><p>Takumi is already bouncing on his toes in excitement, chattering incessantly about the games, the food, the face-painting. It tugs at Yugo’s heartstrings, his little boy’s enthusiasm brightening up their small apartment.</p><p>“Don’t forget, Daddy! You promised we’d do everything together!” Takumi reminds him, his wide eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><p>The mention of a promise sends a pang through Yugo. He recalls the many late nights at work, the missed dinners and stories before bedtime, all the lost opportunities to bond with his son. A part of him considers asking Daigo or Juri to step in for him, bu the sight of Takumi’s excitement melts his resolve.</p><p>“No, I won’t forget, Takumi,” he reassures Takumi, mustering a smile despite the cold seeping into his bones. He makes a silent vow to himself, he won’t let his little boy down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo and Takumi enter the school auditorium, a buzzing hive of excited chatter and playful laughter. Their senses are immediately assailed by the sight of happy families engaged in various games and the smell of popcorn and cotton candy in the air.</p><p>“Look, Daddy! It’s Jesse-<em>sensei</em>!” Takumi exclaims, his fingers clutching Yugo’s hand tightly as he points to Jesse, who’s manning the registration booth.</p><p>The sight of Jesse sends a strange, warm flutter through Yugo’s chest, promptly followed by a pang of discomfort from the fever. He decides to ignore the former and blame the latter on the poorly ventilated auditorium.</p><p>“Hi, Jesse-<em>sensei</em>!” Takumi greets, his eyes sparkling with excitement.</p><p>Jesse’s face lights up at the sight of them, and the corners of his mouth lift in a smile that makes Yugo’s heart skip a beat, or perhaps it’s the fever again.</p><p>Yugo greets Jesse, his voice laced with a hint of awkwardness. He quickly wipes his sweaty forehead with his free hand, hoping Jesse won’t notice his flushed cheeks.</p><p>“Kochi-san, you okay? You’re sweating quite a bit,” Jesse says, a concerned look in his eyes.</p><p>Yugo quickly deflects. “I’m fine, just a little warm in here. Probably should’ve worn something lighter.”</p><p>Before Jesse can press further, a fellow parent grabs Yugo by the arm, eagerly dragging him to the sack race booth. A brief moment of relief washes over Yugo; he’d dodged the bullet.</p><p>Over the next couple of hours, Yugo gives it his all, trying his best to keep up with Takumi, who is a whirling dervish of energy. Yet, as the day progresses, Yugo feels his strength waning, the fever starting to take its toll.</p><p>Suddenly, everything seems to tilt and spin. Yugo’s heart pounds in his chest. He stumbles, a gasp escaping his lips. But before he can fall, a familiar voice steadies him.</p><p>“Kochi-san, are you okay?” Aya’s voice cuts through his dizziness. She has Sakiko by the hand, her other hand firmly holding Yugo up. “Can I borrow Takumi for a bit to play with Sakiko?”</p><p>Yugo manages a weak nod, grateful for Aya’s timely intervention.</p><p>No sooner has Aya taken Takumi, Jesse appears, concern etched on his face. “Kochi-san, you don’t look good,” he says, his voice carrying a note of worry.</p><p>“I’m fine, <em>sen</em>—” But before he can finish, his knees buckle, and his vision blurs. Jesse quickly grabs his wrist, leading him outside.</p><p>Just as they step outside the auditorium, everything goes black for Yugo. His last thought before succumbing to the darkness is how ironic it is that he managed to keep his promise to Takumi but couldn’t keep his feet from failing him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, there’s the sunshine,” says Jesse, his words slipping through the quiet clinic as Yugo awakens.</p><p>“Huh?” Yugo grunts, propping himself on his elbows, his vision blurring and refocusing on the school’s faded posters of health awareness plastered on the walls.</p><p>“You’ve been out cold for two hours,” Jesse explains, crossing his arms and leaning against the edge of the counter.</p><p>Yugo’s brain tries to play catch up. “Where’s Takumi?” he manages to croak out, sounding like he’s swallowed a handful of sand.</p><p>“Your son’s out there, probably believing that he’s the next Indiana Jones,” Jesse replies with a chuckle, gesturing vaguely towards the door. “Aya’s got both the mini adventurers covered. They’re doing that treasure hunt thing, and I have a hunch Takumi hasn’t noticed your absence.”</p><p>A sigh of relief slips from Yugo’s lips. His heart rate slows, and he gingerly sits upright, steadying himself against the bed’s railing.</p><p>“Good, because I promised him …” Yugo’s words trail off as Jesse returns from the medicine cabinet, cradling a bottle of pills and a glass of water in his hands.</p><p>“You promised him you’d be there,” Jesse finishes Yugo’s sentence, placing the items on the bedside table. His voice takes on a tone of mild reproach. “Kochi-san, you should have asked your brother or your best friend to accompany him instead. You have to get some rest when you’re sick.”</p><p>“I promised him that I’d spend the whole day with him,” Yugo admits, glancing away. “With work always piling up, the days I can focus solely on Takumi are rare.”</p><p>“And that’s noble, but what good are you to him if you’re out cold in the nurse’s office?” Jesse says, his gaze soft. “Your responsibility is to be there for Takumi, but that also means taking care of yourself.”</p><p>“I’m doing the best I can,” Yugo defends, fingers clenching the bedsheets. “When Haruka … passed, I promised that I would make Takumi happy. But that means working hard, sometimes too hard. I know it’s not ideal, but it’s the only way I know how.”</p><p>His words hang heavy in the quiet room. Jesse’s face softens, and he extends a hand, placing it gently over Yugo’s.</p><p>“I’ve talked to a lot of single parents, and my sister, Aya, is one too,” Jesse confesses. “And if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that it’s okay to ask for help. You’re not alone, Yugo.”</p><p>Jesse’s hand is warm, his grip firm, but not constrictive. Yugo finds himself accepting the gesture, their fingers interlacing. It’s a small comfort, a beacon in the storm of his thoughts.</p><p>“Can you …?” Yugo starts, his voice barely above a whisper. “Can you tell your sister to explain to Takumi? I don’t want him to worry.”</p><p>Jesse nods, giving Yugo’s hand a reassuring squeeze before he releases it. “I’ll do that. Now, get some rest.”</p><p>As Yugo closes his eyes and slips back into the embrace of sleep, he makes a mental note to blame this sudden vulnerability on the fever. But even in his drowsy state, he can’t deny the comfort Jesse’s presence brings.</p><p>The tension in his chest eases, and for the first time in a long time, he allows himself to rest, knowing someone else is watching over Takumi.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s head throbs less now, his world steady, albeit still a bit off-kilter, but he manages a small smile as he sees the school gates approach. Juri has just pulled up to take him and his little boy home.</p><p>“Hey,” Juri greets, his voice lively, a contrast to the dull throb pounding at the back of Yugo’s skull. Juri catches sight of Yugo’s pale face. “Wow, you look worse than a water-logged cat.”</p><p>“Nice to see you too,” Yugo grumbles, helping Takumi into the back seat of Juri’s car.</p><p>Before they can make their escape, a voice calls out, halting their steps. It’s Aya. Her brow furrows in concern. “Kochi-san, can I get your number?” she asks. “You know, just in case you ever need some help with Takumi. Your brother and your friend can’t always be around.”</p><p>Yugo hesitates, a second too long. But there’s an earnest sincerity in Aya’s eyes that makes him relent. “That … that would be helpful,” he admits. They exchange numbers, and Yugo mumbles a quick ‘thank you’, itching to get back home.</p><p>As they turn to leave, Yugo catches sight of Jesse behind Aya. His heart lurches — part exhaustion, part something else — as Jesse waves goodbye. Yugo only manages a grateful nod, his throat feeling inexplicably tight. He’s left with the lingering image of Jesse’s gentle smile as they finally pull away from the school.</p><p>At home, the familiarity of his own surroundings offers a sense of peace. He bids Juri goodbye, his eyes already heavy, anticipating the comfort of his own bed. He’s just about to collapse when Takumi’s voice stops him.</p><p>“Daddy?” The six-year-old looks at him with innocent curiosity. “Why did you go with me to school if you're sick?”</p><p>Yugo blinks at the question, his mind momentarily caught off guard. “Well, I … I don’t get to spend much time with you these days, Takumi,” he confesses, his voice barely more than a whisper.</p><p>“But I’ll understand if you’re sick, Daddy. I don’t mind.” There’s a stubborn set to Takumi’s little jaw that mirrors Yugo’s own determination. “Besides, I can take care of you too. Like when you take care of me when I'm sick.”</p><p>Tears prick at the corners of Yugo’s eyes. He kneels down, pulling his son into a hug. His heart feels overwhelmingly full, the love he has for his son almost painful in its intensity.</p><p>His laughter is watery, and he can’t help but ruffle Takumi’s hair. “You’re a good boy, Takumi,” he says, voice choked with emotions. “You’re the best boy.”</p><p>Maybe his world is a little off-balance. Maybe he’s scared of the uncertainty that lies ahead. But at this moment, with his son’s arms wrapped around him, Yugo knows one thing for sure: he’s right where he needs to be.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the quiet sanctuary of his bedroom, Yugo paces, his steps measured and precise. He’s been on bed rest for the past couple of days, nursing the fever, and his room has become uncluttered reflection of his health: messy, disorganized, and uncharacteristically chaotic. It’s high time he cleaned it up and got himself back to his normal routines, back to his job the next day.</p><p>His phone buzzes on the bedside table, breaking the silence. It’s a message from Aya. She’s inviting him to dinner celebrating the fundraising event’s success. It’s an innocent enough invitation, one that would typically warrant a simple yes or no. But tonight, it feels like a daunting task.</p><p>He types back a quick confirmation, but before he hits send, he hesitates, adding an afterthought. “Could you thank your brother for me? For bringing me to the clinic.”</p><p>Seconds later, a reply arrives — not words, but a QR code and a simple instruction.</p><p>“Go tell him yourself.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart skips a beat, his finger hovering above the screen. It’s Jesse’s number.</p><p>Panic wells up inside him, a rapid-fire series of thoughts racing through his mind. He’s not one for impromptu actions or casual conversations. He swallows, a part of him, maybe the small, daring part of him that got drunk that one night and wound up with Jesse, whispering that he should do it.</p><p>He takes a deep breath, focusing on the task at hand. He’s just thanking Jesse for his help at the family fun day, nothing more, nothing less. It’s an act of gratitude, not a declaration of feelings. There’s nothing wrong or scandalous about it.</p><p>He can do this.</p><p>He is doing this.</p><p>His thumbs hover over the screen, forming the message.</p><p>“Hello, Jesse-sensei. This is Kochi Yugo. Your sister, Omasa-san, gave me your number. I just want to thank you for helping me at the family fun day.”</p><p>He rewrites the message a dozen times before finally hitting send.</p><p>The response is immediate, making Yugo’s heart stutter.</p><p>“It’s no big deal, Kochi-san. Let me know if you need help with Takumi. :)”</p><p>His breath hitches. Does he dare to continue the conversation. “Are you going to the dinner?” Yugo types, his fingers surprisingly steady.</p><p>Jesse’s response comes quick, the three little dots popping up almost instantly. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“Great. See you there,” Yugo sends back, finally letting out the breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Good night, sensei.”</p><p>The conversation ends there, but the smile on Yugo’s face doesn’t. He’s got a date on Friday — well, not a date, technically, but close enough — and that knowledge is enough to make the burden of cleaning his room seem a little less daunting.</p><p>He goes to bed, his last thoughts before sleep takes over filled with anticipation for Friday’s dinner, and the knowledge that Jesse will be there.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Evening shadows stretch across the city as Yugo steps hesitantly into the bustling izakaya. The noise washes over him — the laughter, the chatter, the clinking glasses. Amidst this sea of voices, Yugo wends his way to the table where teachers and parent volunteers are already drowning in food and drink.</p><p>His gaze lands on the only empty chair — a seat next to Jesse. A flutter of anticipation dances in his stomach as he slides into it, and Jesse graces him with a smile that could melt the coldest of hearts.</p><p>“Feeling better?” he asks, his voice a calming balm amidst the cacophony.</p><p>Yugo blushes, the heat spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. He stammers a quick, “Y-yes,” unsure if he's answering Jesse’s question or acknowledging his own feelings. It’s definitely not the fever this time.</p><p>Aya appears at his elbow with the menu, effectively breaking the spell. “Order something,” she instructs, nodding towards the list of dishes and drinks.</p><p>As Yugo takes the menu from Aya, his gaze strays back to Jesse. He can’t help but notice the way Jesse’s laughter lights up his eyes, and how his heart skips a beat every time their arms brush against each other.</p><p>Their arms seem to have minds of their own, coming together and lingering in a dance as old as time itself. When Jesse cracks a joke about a peculiar parent they had met earlier, Yugo finds himself laughing more than he has in weeks. Their eyes lock, and Yugo dares to hold his gaze, their silent communication igniting something within him.</p><p>But as the room starts spinning slightly and Yugo’s head begins to pound, he realizes he’s had a bit too much to drink. He doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes. “I need some air,” he mumbles, rising from his seat.</p><p>Outside, the night air cools his heated cheeks. He leans against the wall, willing his senses to clear. The door creaks open and Jesse steps out, concern etched on his face.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Jesse asks, reaching out to touch Yugo’s forehead. “You’re warm.”</p><p>Yugo shakes his head and shrugs away Jesse’s hand. “I’m okay,” he insists. “I just don’t want to go home drunk.”</p><p>Jesse’s concern softens into understanding. “I can walk you partway home,” he offers. “I live nearby, and I was thinking of leaving early anyway.”</p><p>Yugo takes him up on the offer. They retrieve Yugo’s bag from the <em>izakaya</em>, and then begin their journey home. Their walk is comfortable, filled with light banter and shared laughter. Each brush of their hands sends a jolt of electricity up Yugo’s arm.</p><p>Standing at a corner, Yugo gazes at Jesse. His heart beats like a wild drum in his chest. Would it really be so terrible to take a chance, like last time?</p><p>“I live that way,” Jesse points, interrupting Yugo’s thoughts. They bid each other goodnight, but as Jesse turns to leave, Yugo finds himself reaching out.</p><p>“Wait!” Yugo calls out, and before he can think twice about it, he’s pulling Jesse towards him.</p><p>Their lips meet in a surprised but passionate kiss.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, Yugo whispers, “I don’t want to go home yet.” His words hang in the air, filled with longing.</p><p>Jesse pulls back slightly, a small smile tugging at his lips. “I don’t want to go home yet either,” he says. “Maybe we can continue this somewhere else?”</p><p>The words are all Yugo needs. He kisses Jesse again, sealing the agreement between them.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Jesse awakens to the sunlight streaming through the room, a feeling of déjà vu washing over him. His heart races as he glances to his side, half-expecting the space between him to be empty. To his relief, Yugo is still there, chest rising and falling softly in a peaceful slumber.</p><p>A sigh of relief escapes Jesse’s lips. He leans in, pressing a gentle kiss to Yugo’s forehead. “Hey, sleepyhead.”</p><p>Yugo stirs, groggily blinking his eyes open. He looks positively adorable in his drowsy state, and Jesse can’t help the grin that forms on his lips. Yugo smiles back at him, returning the kiss. His eyes, however, hold a hint of unease. “Takumi …”</p><p>“Will be fine,” Jesse completes, squeezing Yugo’s hand. “Your brother’s with him, right?”</p><p>Yugo nods, the smile faltering. “I’m planning to take him to the zoo to make up for not seeing him this morning.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “Always the responsible one, huh?” He then turns serious. “What excuse did you make up for not going home last night?”</p><p>“I-I didn’t. I told Daigo and Juri the truth,” Yugo confesses, meeting Jesse’s eyes. “I thought someone should know. I mean, in case …”</p><p>Jesse cuts him off, his smile gone but his tone soft. “I get it. And, I guess I can trust Aya and my best friend, too.”</p><p>Yugo’s fingers nervously twine with Jesse’s as he sits up, leaning against the headboard. He swallows. “Can we … talk about last night?”</p><p>Jesse nods, his hand squeezing Yugo’s reassuringly, but before he can respond, his stomach interrupts with a grumble. They both stare at each other, and then burst out laughing.</p><p>“Guess we’ll order breakfast first, huh?” Jesse says, reaching for the hotel’s room service menu.</p><p>As they dig into their grilled salmon and miso soup, Yugo finally gathers the courage to speak, his voice barely audible over the clink of the chopsticks. “There’s no turning back now, Jesse,” he says.</p><p>Jesse glances at him, nodding solemnly. He understood the implications, the potential of their relationship being discovered and the consequences that it could have, both on him and on Takumi’s school life.</p><p>“And we can’t let anyone from school know,” Yugo continues, mirroring Jesse’s understanding. “But …” His voice trails off, his gaze fixed on Jesse. “I want to keep seeing you.”</p><p>Jesse’s heart flutters, a warmth spreading through him. “We can. It’ll be the school field trip at the end of the month, and it’ll be summer, remember? We’ll have time to ourselves then.”</p><p>They finish their meal in comfortable silence. Jesse pulls Yugo into an embrace. “I don’t regret this, Yugo,” he whispers into his ear.</p><p>Yugo wraps his arms around Jesse in response, his voice equally soft. “I don’t either.”</p><p>Their lips meet in a tender kiss that gradually deepens, and they end up tumbling back on the bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s been a fortnight since Jesse has seen Yugo in person, two whole weeks of quick texts and occasional video calls, the teacher buried under piles of papers to grade and the credit analyst lost in numbers.</p><p>Yugo insisted it would be for the best. After all, the school field looms over the horizon, Jesse needs to catch up on grading, and Yugo has an enormous work project. It’s a logical decision, considering their circumstances.</p><p>Yet, as Jesse steps out of the faculty room after a long day, ready to return to his empty apartment, he quite literally bumps into Yugo, who is standing outside.</p><p>“Yu—Kochi-san!” Jesse blinks, surprise evident in his voice. “What brings you here?”</p><p>“Takumi forgot something,” Yugo hints, an apologetic smile on his face. “Mind if I retrieve it?”</p><p>The sense of professionalism in Jesse nudges him to maintain his teacherly demeanor, and he nods. “Sure. Let me show you his classroom.”</p><p>They walk in silence until they reach the empty first-grade classroom, the bulletin board filled with artworks of the students, depicting their plans for the summer. “What did he forget?” Jesse asks.</p><p>Yugo doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, as soon as the door clicks shut, he turns the lock and pulls Jesse towards him, his lips finding Jesse’s in a kiss.</p><p>Jesse’s eyes go wide, but only for a moment before he melts into the kiss, his hands instinctively finding their way around Yugo, pushing him against the wall.</p><p>When they finally part for air, Yugo is grinning, a playful glint in his eyes. “I missed you, Jesse,” he confesses, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>The sight of Yugo, flustered and out of breath, sends a thrill through Jesse. He returns the grin, planting a quick kiss on the tip of Yugo’s nose. “Believe me, the feeling is mutual.”</p><p>“I thought I could wait until the field trip,” Yugo admits, his fingers brushing through Jesse’s hair. “But, I couldn’t resist.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, pressing his forehead against Yugo’s. “Where’s Takumi?”</p><p>“He’s at the playground, with his friends,” Yugo replies, wrapping his arms tighter around Jesse.</p><p>A devilish grin forms on Jesse’s lips. “I suppose Takumi wouldn’t mind waiting five more minutes, would he?” And with that, Jesse claims Yugo’s lips once more, lost in their little world within the confines of the empty classroom.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The evening unfolds in comfortable normalcy. Jesse and Shintaro sit cross-legged on the living room floor, their laps occupied by bowls of steaming instant ramen. They are deep in discussion about the latest teaching methodologies when Jesse catches Shintaro’s gaze on him. It lingers, paired with a grin that’s nothing short of mischievous.</p><p>“You’re giving me that weird ‘I’ve-got-a-secret’ look,” Jesse observes, slurping his noodles.</p><p>Shintaro leans forward, pointing at Jesse’s neck. “You’ve either had an encounter with a feisty octopus or … is that a hickey?”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes widen. <em>A hickey? From Yugo? He did NOT!</em> He dashes to a mirror by the door, craning his neck. And there it is, a mark he cannot deny. “Ugh, how do I hide this now? The field trip’s tomorrow!”</p><p>“Makeup.” Shintaro chuckles, tossing a scarf from the couch to him. “Or this, but people are gonna wonder why you’re wearing a scarf in the summer. But seriously, aren’t you a bit old for hickeys?”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes as he returns to his seat. “Very funny, Shin. But I don’t remember reading any ‘No Hickey’ clause in the teacher’s handbook.” He sighs as he takes his bowl again. “I’ll run to the convenience store and grab foundation.”</p><p>Shintaro’s smile turns gentle, concern evident in his eyes. “All kidding aside, Jesse, are you good with all this secrecy? You’re not one to hide things, especially a relationship.”</p><p>Jesse sets his ramen bowl aside. “You’re right, but Yugo and I … we have reasons. We’re waiting it out until the academic year ends.”</p><p>Shintaro nods. “It’s a big sacrifice. Just know you’ve got me, alright? Whenever you need an ear or just a night out.”</p><p>The appreciation shines in Jesse’s eyes. “Thanks, Shin.”</p><p>Jesse’s phone chimes, signaling a new message. It’s from Yugo. He opens it to find a delightful picture of Yugo and Takumi with bunny-shaped rice balls inside a lunch box.</p><p>“<em>Takumi can’t wait to share this with sensei and his classmates tomorrow,</em>” Jesse reads aloud. He laughs, showing Shintaro the picture. “Look at this! If circumstances were different, I’d be over there, attempting those rice balls with them.”</p><p>Shintaro rolls his eyes playfully. “Given your culinary talents, you’d turn them into dinosaurs.”</p><p>“That’s Takumi’s other favorite!” Jesse counters, a smirk playing on his lips.</p><p>Shintaro pretends to be horrified. “So once you and Yugo are out in the open, are you ditching our bro-time dinners?”</p><p>Grinning, Jesse playfully pushes Shintaro. “You’re irreplaceable, you drama king. But maybe … less instant ramen and more bunny rice balls in our future?”</p><p>Shintaro feigns heartbreak, gripping his chest dramatically. “The betrayals of love!”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The morning sun pours in through the windows of the faculty room, casting long, golden streaks across the room. Amid the hustle of teachers, Jesse sits at a desk littered with papers, meticulously double-checking his list before the kids arrive for the field trip.</p><p>A familiar scent fills the air, and Jesse doesn’t need to look up to know that Taiga is now in the room. Taiga walks in with a bounce to his step, a sheaf of documents in hand.</p><p>“Morning, Jesse!” Taiga greets cheerfully. His eyes drop to Jesse’s neck, and they sparkle mischievously. “Trying to attract some attention with that?”</p><p>Jesse’s hand flies to his neck, fingers brushing over the hickey. “I tried covering it with makeup!” he sputters.</p><p>Taiga chuckles, approaching him. “Got that foundation with you?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes but with a hint of a smile, Jesse pulls out a cushion and a tube of foundation from his bag. “Don’t make it obvious, please.”</p><p>Taiga gestures for Jesse to sit, and as Jesse complies, Taiga begins applying the foundation. “You know,” he muses, “you never bothered hiding these when I was the one leaving them.”</p><p>Jesse smirks. “We were in college then. It was practically a badge of honor.”</p><p>They both share a laugh. Jesse is glad that they’re able to look back at their relationship now without the residual feelings.</p><p>After a brief silence, Taiga, his voice softer, asks, “So, who’s the lucky guy?”</p><p>Jesse avoids his gaze. “I-I can’t say.”</p><p>Taiga pauses, and a knowing glint enters his eyes. “<em>Single Dad</em>?” he whispers.</p><p>Jesse’s lack of response is enough confirmation.</p><p>Taiga exhales deeply, looking away for a moment. “<em>I knew it</em>. I won’t say a word, promise.” When he meets Jesse’s gaze, he smiles and pats his neck. “I think that should be enough coverage.”</p><p>Before they can continue, the door swings open to reveal Hokuto. He freezes, eyebrows shooting up at the sight of Taiga holding Jesse’s neck. A range of emotions fills his eyes, cheeks blushing crimson. “Um … am I interrupting?” he stammers, stepping inside quickly to grab his bag.</p><p>“No, Hokuto, it’s not—” Taiga begins.</p><p>But Hokuto, already flustered, dashes out of the room.</p><p>“Crap!” Taiga groans, hastily packing his belongings.</p><p>Jesse blinks, piecing together what just unfolded. “Wait, Taiga, do you—”</p><p>But Taiga’s already out the door, chasing after Hokuto, leaving Jesse in bewilderment.</p><p>Jesse ponders over the whirlwind of events before a thought occurs to him. Despite the unexpected turn of events, he ends up chuckling as he resumes getting ready for the day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Amid the organized chaos of excited students clambering onto the bus, Jesse has his hands full. His mental checklist is constantly ticking off items: Akiko has her sunscreen, Sho has his water bottle, Takumi … where’s Takumi?</p><p>Thankfully, a familiar voice calms his nerves. “Hey there, Jesse-sensei.”</p><p>Jesse turns, meeting Yugo’s eyes. His stern demeanor as a credit analyst almost vanishes when he’s around Takumi. “Morning, Kochi-san. Glad you could join.”</p><p>Yugo smirks, though the twinkle in his eyes betrays his jest. “Wouldn’t miss a chance to make sure you’re doing your job right.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, playing along. “I’ll have you know I run a tight ship. No student left behind.”</p><p>Takumi, in his astronaut-themed backpack and a T-Rex cap, looks up, making air quotes with his tiny fingers. “Even if my ‘ship’ is a ‘spaceship,’  Jesse-sensei?”</p><p>Jesse kneels down to Takumi’s level, eyes sparkling with mirth. “Especially then. Who else will protect us from space dinosaurs?”</p><p>Takumi giggles, clearly delighted with the image. “Maybe Daddy can. He’s strong!”</p><p>Jesse eyes Yugo teasingly. “Is that so? I thought he’s just good with numbers.”</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow, his smile evident. “Hey, I’ll have you know I can do at least … ten push-ups.”</p><p>Their banter is interrupted by the bus’ soft chugging, indicating it’s almost time to depart. Students settle in, chattering away. Yugo slides into a seat next to Takumi, the two of them a heartwarming tableau of father and son.</p><p>From his vantage point, Jesse can’t help but observe the duo. Yugo’s doting side is a sight to behold. The man fusses over every strap, every zip, every little detail, ensuring his son is perfectly equipped for the day ahead.</p><p>“Daddy!” Takumi whines, attempting to wriggle away. “You’re treating me like a baby!”</p><p>“Sorry, buddy,” Yugo murmurs, ruffling his son’s hair. “Just want to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Jesse’s heart melts. <em>He really is a good dad</em>.</p><p>Their gazes meet, and a silent message passes between them. One of shared secrets, shared glances, shared moments.</p><p>Jesse feels a warmth spread through him, but the moment is fleeting. Yugo quickly looks away, blushing, while Jesse hides his own reddening cheeks by busying himself with a clipboard.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse’s shoes echo on the marble floors of the National History Museum, every footstep punctuating the weight of responsibility he feels. The museum buzzes with first-grade students, their excited voices bouncing off tall ceilings.</p><p>Beside Jesse, Takumi, with eyes as wide as saucers, points at each exhibit, his voice a cocktail of amazement and curiosity. “Look, Jesse-sensei, a fossil!”</p><p>“That’s right, buddy.” Jesse smiles down at him.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he catches Yugo approaching, a casual smile on his lips. “Quite a handful, aren’t they?”</p><p>Jesse grins. “Always. But it’s rewarding. Especially with dino-experts like Takumi.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, his gaze lingering on Jesse a little too long.</p><p>But just as the two share a subtle, knowing look, Mrs. Kojima, a fellow parent-chaperone, steps in. “Oh, Kochi-san,” she chirps, batting her eyelashes. “Isn’t this just a wonderful trip? Takumi must be so happy you’re here.”</p><p>Jesse internally groans. <em>There goes my moment with Yugo</em>.</p><p>“Uh, yes, Kojima-san,” Yugo replies, his voice holding a hint of resignation. “Takumi does love dinosaurs.”</p><p>Jesse busies himself with the other kids, helping them understand the exhibits, yet occasionally stealing glances towards Yugo. But every time, Mrs. Kojima seems to magically wedge herself between them. <em>Does she have a sixth sense for ruining my plans or what?</em></p><p>The group moves to the Dinosaur Exhibit. Here, Takumi truly shines, rattling off facts about every dinosaur. “The Velociraptor was only as tall as a human,” he educates the group, his tiny finger pointing to the display.</p><p>Suddenly, there’s a commotion. “Jesse-sensei!” a student shouts. “The sandpit is a mess!”</p><p>Jesse looks over, alarmed. A few overenthusiastic kids have “flooded” the mock archaeological dig site with sand. The rest of the students look at the mess with wide eyes.</p><p><em>Just another day in the life of an elementary school teacher</em>, Jesse thinks, preparing to tackle the situation. But just as he’s about to dive into the chaos, Yugo steps in.</p><p>“Alright kids!” Yugo announces loudly, drawing everyone’s attention. “Who can tell me three things about the T-Rex?”</p><p>While the children excitedly start shouting answers, Jesse seizes the opportunity  to deal with the sand debacle.</p><p>When the sandy crisis is finally averted, Jesse seeks out Yugo, finding him in a secluded nook beside the History of Fossils display. He’s tucked away from prying eyes, and the dim light gives the place an intimate aura.</p><p>“Thanks for the save back there,” Jesse says, stepping closer.</p><p>Yugo smirks. “Wouldn’t want Takumi’s teacher buried under a pile of sand.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, then hesitates for a moment. Their fingers brush against each other, sending electric jolts through him. “This wasn’t exactly the alone time I envisioned.”</p><p>Yugo tilts his head, an amused smile dancing on his lips. “We might find a moment later.”</p><p>Eager to change the topic, Jesse blurts out the one thing he had been wanting to ask today. “What are you doing next Saturday?”</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow, teasingly. “Nothing. Why?”</p><p>Jesse blushes, stumbling over his words. “It’s … um, my birthday. Thought maybe I could have you all to myself that day.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes widen in surprise, then soften. “Jesse,” he whispers, smiling warmly. “I’d love to.”</p><p>Before they can revel in the moment, Takumi bursts in. “Daddy! Jesse-sensei! The Brachiosaurus! You HAVE to see!”</p><p>The two men share a look, a mix of amusement adoration, before Yugo ruffles Takumi’s hair. “Lead the way, Captain Dino!”</p><p>Jesse watches them walk away, warmth spreading through him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sunlight filters through the trees, creating a dappled pattern on the grass of the park. The scent of fresh sandwiches fills the air as Jesse and his fellow teachers gather, a lunchtime ritual where they can break away from the students for a short while.</p><p>Jesse spots Taiga laughing with some of the teachers. Despite their past, Jesse’s always admired how Taiga effortlessly commands attention. Spotting Hokuto sitting a bit isolated, his eyebrows furrow in concern. He looks deflated, which means that he and Taiga haven’t resolved the incident that morning.</p><p>Unable to resist, Jesse pulls Taiga aside. “Taiga,” he starts, eyes darting to Hokuto, “are you two okay?”</p><p>Taiga’s boisterous laughter fades, replaced by a forced smile. “I’ll handle it, Jesse.” Typical of him to always take charge of situations.</p><p>Taiga’s sharp gaze falls on Yugo, who’s trying (and failing) to feed Takumi a sandwich while the boy is playing with his new dinosaur plushie. A smirk spreads across Taiga’s face. “Need a moment with Single Dad there?”</p><p>Jesse blushes. “It’s not like that … well, okay, it is. But how did you—”</p><p>Taiga interrupts with a sly grin. “Secluded bench near the pond. Was supposed to be there with someone …” He trails off, his gaze flicking towards Hokuto. “Anyway, I’ll take care of the kids, and I’ll tell him. Go!”</p><p>Taking the hint, Jesse grabs his lunch and heads to the described bench, anticipation bubbling within him. The bench is just as Taiga had said — away from prying eyes, nestled between a group of trees overlooking a serene pond.</p><p>His heart skips a beat when he spots Yugo approaching, lunch in hand. But before Yugo can even utter a greeting, Jesse pulls him close, their lips meeting in a sweet, desperate kiss.</p><p>Pulling away slightly breathless, Jesse admits, “Missed you.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “We’ve been together the whole day.”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>Lunch bags rustle as they settle, but before Jesse can take his first bite, Yugo starts, “I’ve been thinking about your birthday.”</p><p>Jesse’s brows shoot up. “Really? Now?”</p><p>Yugo blushes, stammering. “S-So,” he stammers, “there’s this discount coupon for a hotel in Hakone, and I thought—”</p><p>Jesse grins. “A romantic getaway?”</p><p>Yugo nods sheepishly. “I thought it’d be a … nice birthday treat.”</p><p>Feeling a mix of amusement and adoration, Jesse leans over, planting a soft kiss on Yugo’s cheek. “It sounds wonderful.”</p><p>Their sweet interlude is eventually interrupted by the chime of a text. Jesse pulls out his phone and groans.</p><p>It’s a text from Taiga: <em>Time’s almost up, Romeo</em>.</p><p>With a chuckle, Jesse shows the message to Yugo, who laughs heartily. “Guess we better speed-eat then!”</p><p>The two hastily finish their meals, packing up amidst giggles and playful nudges. As they head back, their fingers brush against each other.</p><p>It’s not easy keeping their relationship a secret, but little moments make everything worth it.</p>

<p>A delicate rustle of summer leaves serenades the surroundings, and the Hakone resort unveils itself like a dreamy painting, immersed in an air of serenity. Yugo instantly senses the history of every stone and path, appreciating the precision and order in the garden. Still, with Jesse by his side, everything feels newer, fresher.</p><p>Walking beside Yugo, Jesse can’t resist the playful jab. “Well, this is quite the upgrade from our usual haunts.” He smirks, delivering a friendly bump with his shoulder.</p><p>Yugo’s laughter, genuine and light, fills the space between them. “No kidding. But I figure for your birthday, we deserve a little luxury.”</p><p>A smile tugs at Jesse’s lips, crinkling the corners of his eyes – that same expression Yugo finds himself getting lost in more often than not. “Good call. And just think, we could spend the entire weekend lazing around that private open-air onsen in our room.”</p><p>“Mm, I like the sound of that,” Yugo murmurs, letting instinct take over as he curls an arm around Jesse’s waist, the warmth between them tangible.</p><p>Leaning into the embrace, Jesse’s contented sigh sounds almost musical. As they stroll, their steps synchronize. Yugo’s internal monologue churns out thought after thought. <em>Is this real? Us, here, in the open. It feels... right.</em> But despite the thoughts, he lets himself savor the moment.</p><p>When the path brings them full circle to the resort’s lobby, Yugo spots a secluded alcove. Without hesitation, he pulls Jesse into the private nook, the urgency driven by both affection and the fear of prying eyes. “Thank you for doing this with me. I know it hasn’t been easy, keeping us a secret.”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes, filled with depth and understanding, lock onto Yugo’s. With a tenderness that takes Yugo’s breath away, Jesse places a hand against his cheek, the touch grounding and reassuring. “You’re worth it,” he whispers, bridging the gap between them, sealing the sentiment with a soft, lingering kiss.</p><p>For Yugo, the world narrows down to just this – Jesse's lips against his, the warmth of the alcove, and the promise of many more stolen moments like this. Lost in the embrace, Yugo’s thoughts hum in the background. <em>Who would've thought? From that drunk night to this. Life sure has its surprises.</em></p><p>But for now, everything feels just right.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their suite’s stillness is only disturbed by the sly rustling of the tatami mats. The soft glint of sunlight filtering through the paper sliding doors casts a warm hue across Jesse’s face, making his features even more striking. He’s entirely engrossed by the magnificent silhouette of Mount Fuji outside, almost like a child peering through the glass pane of a candy store. Yugo watches him, feeling an overwhelming sense of affection.</p><p>“This view is incredible,” Jesse muses. “I could stare at Mount Fuji all day.”</p><p>Unable to resist any longer, Yugo sneaks up and wraps his arms around Jesse’s frame. “I’d much rather stare at you,” he mumbles, his voice slightly muffled by Jesse’s shirt.</p><p>In a swift move, Jesse spins around, catching Yugo off guard. Their lips meet, the connection deepening with every heartbeat. Yugo can’t help but get lost in the sensation, the soft caress of Jesse’s lips a stark contrast to the hard wall pressing into his back.</p><p>Jesse moves his mouth to Yugo’s jaw, teasing and exploring. Yugo’s hands clutch the fabric of Jesse’s shirt, every new sensation making his head spin. Yugo finds himself unraveling, a thrill of pleasure spiking through him at Jesse’s whispered confession.</p><p>“God, I want you so bad.”</p><p>However, Yugo’s tendencies, even in the midst of passion, won’t let him forget about the clock. The soft slide of his shirt reminds him of the time and their dinner reservations.</p><p>“Mm … wait,” Yugo manages, his fingers coming up to cover Jesse’s, stilling them.</p><p>Jesse’s brow furrows. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong,” Yugo responds, lips quirking into a smile. The humor isn’t lost on him, seeing Jesse, usually so composed in front of his students, appearing so … unhinged. “It’s just that we have dinner plans soon.”</p><p>Jesse’s playful pout makes its appearance. “Can’t we skip dinner?” He draws out the words, his voice dripping with mischief. “I’m hungry for something else right now.”</p><p>It takes all of Yugo’s willpower not to cave. “Tempting,” he admits, trying to keep his voice steady. “But it’s a fancy restaurant, and I already made us reservations.”</p><p>With a dramatic sigh that could put any theater actor to shame, Jesse steps back, mock resignation on his face. “Ugh, fine.” However, his playfulness cannot be suppressed, and he gives Yugo’s rear a teasing smack. “But don’t think I’m forgetting about this later.”</p><p>Yugo, chuckling, starts to button up his shirt, thinking to himself that this weekend promises to be one for the books.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The backdrop of the tone, with its sweeping green landscapes and serene gardens, makes Yugo wonder if all romantic adventures feel this invigorating. They stroll along the resort’s cobblestone pathway, a comfortable silence enveloping them, only interrupted by the rustling leaves and chirping crickets.</p><p>Jesse, ever the one to notice and appreciate the beauty in everything, breaks the silence, a hint of wonder in his voice. “It’s so peaceful here. Hard to believe we were working just yesterday.”</p><p>Yugo can't help but smile at that. “Makes you forget about everything else for a little while,” he admits, letting the familiar smell of sulfur from the hot springs fill his nostrils.</p><p>But in the midst of their serenity, the universe seems to have other plans. Jesse’s grip on Yugo’s hand goes from soft to vice-like in a split second, drawing Yugo's attention to the unmistakable voice of Mrs. Kojima.</p><p>Mrs. Kojima! The one person who can connect the dots between Jesse, Yugo, and little Takumi. His heart leaps into his throat at the potential complications.</p><p>Not missing a beat, and with a swiftness Yugo didn’t realize he possessed, he steers both of them behind a thick bamboo thicket. It’s like they’ve suddenly become spies in a thriller movie, sneaking around to avoid being caught. But the danger feels real, and the stakes, incredibly high. Their combined warmth as they press together seems magnified tenfold, the tension palpable.</p><p>For a few nail-biting moments, as Mrs. Kojima’s gossip about some friends extravagant summer plans wafts through the green foliage, Yugo contemplates the ‘what ifs’. What if they were spotted? Would their secret trysts become fodder for school gate gossip?</p><p>When her voice fades, there’s a collective exhale. “That was close,” Jesse whispers, chuckling wryly.</p><p>Drawing back slightly, Yugo looks into Jesse’s expressive eyes, wondering if he ever regrets the cloak-and-dagger nature of their relationship. But all he sees is warmth and understanding.</p><p>Jesse tilts his head, his lips brushing Yugo’s cheek in a tender gesture. “But it’s worth it,” he says softly, a twinkle in his eye. “All of it. For this.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo and Jesse sit across from each other, the hum of conversation in the restaurant making them lean slightly forward to catch each other's words. A cascade of paper lanterns paints their features in a soft orange hue, reminiscent of a sunset. As Jesse reaches out for the menu, his fingers brush against Yugo’s, sending a tiny jolt between them.</p><p>Perusing the selections, Yugo’s eyes freeze on a particular dish — udon. Not just any udon, but a deconstructed version, each ingredient painstakingly described.</p><p>“I remember when Takumi was just a toddler,” Yugo begins, his voice tinged with nostalgia. “Trying to make udon after a long day at work, and without Daigo around. Takumi, just a little thing then, was crying, needing attention and warmth.”</p><p>Jesse looks up, an affectionate smile on his lips. “Solo dad mode on?” He’s probably imagining Yugo, younger, more tired, yet still committed.</p><p>Yugo chuckles, “Completely. The udon turned out a mess. The noodles were all clumped together, but Takumi still tried to eat them. I felt so bad but also realized that sometimes, it’s the effort that counts.”</p><p>Jesse seems to be imagining the scene. “Teaching is somewhat the same, you know," he remarks. "You want to reach out, connect, and sometimes, all your efforts just... clump together. But then you find that one breakthrough.”</p><p>A smirk forms on Yugo’s lips. “Do tell.”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes playfully. “There was this student. Silent as a mouse. One day, I brought in cookies Aya had baked, and you wouldn’t believe how his eyes shone. We started talking about baking after that.”</p><p>Yugo nods, clearly impressed. “It’s intriguing how something as simple as food can bridge gaps.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “Yeah. Speaking of which, remember our first parent-teacher conference? After our … unexpected night?”</p><p>Yugo bursts into laughter, thinking back. “Oh, please, don’t remind me. Takumi had been going on about his amazing homeroom teacher named ‘Jesse-sensei’ and thought, ‘There’s no way it’s the same Jesse… right?’”</p><p>Jesse grins, his teeth gleaming in the lantern light. “I was not prepared for when you came in the faculty room! I almost dropped my phone when I saw you.”</p><p>They both laugh, recalling the awkward tension of that day. There’s a rhythm between them — every remembrance, every dish, takes them on a journey through their pasts, gradually merging their paths.</p><p>As the meal progresses, Yugo realizes the evening isn’t just about the food or the setting; it’s about them and the intricate dance of understanding one another. It’s in the way Jesse listens, the sparkle in his eyes when Yugo shares, and the warmth of Jesse's hand on his when they reach for the same dish.</p><p>Finishing the last of their wine, Yugo feels both full and fulfilled. Their shared memories, the honesty of the evening, makes him feel more connected to Jesse than ever before.</p><p>They walk back, the night air cool against their skin. The silence between them isn’t awkward; it's filled with unspoken sentiments.</p><p>Jesse suddenly tightens his grip, looking into Yugo's eyes. “Tonight was special. Sharing memories, getting to know each other more … Thank you."</p><p>Yugo feels a warmth that has nothing to do with the summer night. “Thank you, Jesse. For being here, with me.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Returning to their room, they decide to unwind in the private open-air onsen. They strip down and don their yukatas, a giddy excitement passing between them. Yugo leads the way outside, the balmy evening air caressing them. The onsen water, enveloped by an aroma of minerals and steam, beckons invitingly.</p><p>They rinse off quickly then ease into the soothing pool, sitting close with shoulders touching.  “Hey,” Jesse, breaking a comfortable silence. “Thanks for this. It’s … perfect.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart skips. “I’m glad you like it.”</p><p>The two sit in companionable silence, enjoying the warmth enveloping them, the lights of Hakone glinting faintly in the distance. The sultry summer air, the intimacy of the setting, and their shared experiences of the day, gradually draw them closer. An innocuous comment about the starry sky above quickly escalates into playful splashing, laughter echoing in the secluded space.</p><p>Jesse’s gaze captures Yugo's. Suddenly, the world consists of just the two of them. They lean in, lips meeting in a heated exchange, their yukatas forgotten at the onsen’s edge.</p><p>Hands roam beneath the water as they savor this rare moment of intimacy. Their passion escalates until they reluctantly leave the onsen.</p><p>Dripping wet in their yukatas, they hurry back to their room, pawing at the knotted robes. They tumble into bed, fingers fumbling urgently with each barrier of clothing.</p><p>At last they lay skin to skin, and Yugo drinks in the sight of Jesse sprawled before him. He ghosts kisses along Jesse’s neck, eliciting sighs of pleasure. Their bodies entwine with familiar ease, fitting together flawlessly.</p><p>Time blurs as they lose themselves in heated touches and soft moans. All Yugo knows is Jesse — his warmth, his scent, his smile.</p><p>They climax in unison, clinging tightly, never wanting to let go.</p><p>Afterward they lay wrapped in each other’s arms, legs tangled together, exchanging lazy kisses. Yugo strokes Jesse’s hair, feeling truly at peace.</p><p>Glancing at the clock, he realizes it has struck midnight. He brushes his thumb over Jesse’s cheek. “Happy birthday, Jesse.”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes shine with joy. “Best birthday ever,” he proclaims, snuggling against Yugo’s chest.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s eyes flutter open, roused by the soft chirping of birds outside. His surroundings are washed in a soft golden hue as sunlight filters through traditional paper screens. Beside him, Jesse’s chest rises and falls steadily, his face serene in the gentle morning light. Taking a moment to appreciate the man beside him, Yugo softly brushes a lock of hair off Jesse’s forehead and plants a tender kiss there.</p><p>“Good morning, birthday boy,” Yugo murmurs, his voice husky from sleep.</p><p>Jesse’s blue eyes flutter open slowly. A lazy grin spreads across his face. “Being awakened by you like this? Best. Birthday. Ever.”</p><p>Yugo laughs softly. “Well, you better get used to it.”</p><p>They share a comfortable silence, punctuated only by the chirping birds outside. As they pull away from a lingering kiss, the chemistry between them crackles — palpable, undeniable.</p><p>Freshened up and dressed, the two men find themselves in the resort’s open-air dining area. The majestic sight of Mount Fuji serves as the backdrop, its peak glowing softly in the morning light.</p><p>Jesse lets out a low whistle. “Now that's a view!”</p><p>Yugo, appreciating both the mountain and the man beside him, replies, “You’re not so bad yourself.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, “Flattery will get you everywhere.”</p><p>Before them, a traditional Japanese breakfast spread is elegantly laid out. Mid-conversation, a spectacular dance of birds erupts over the nearby lake, catching their attention.</p><p>Yugo, lost in the spectacle, says, “I wish every morning could start like this.”</p><p>Jesse’s fingers entwine with Yugo’s. “With you, every morning is this beautiful.”</p><p>A smile tugs at Yugo's lips. “You and your cheesy lines.”</p><p>Jesse grins. “But you wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>“No,” Yugo admits. “I wouldn’t.”</p><p>Yugo then recounts a hilarious incident about Takumi, who once gazed at the sky and earnestly proclaimed that a particularly fluffy cloud was, in fact, Mount Fuji. Jesse laughs heartily, his clear, melodious laughter echoing in the open space.</p><p>However, Yugo’s thoughts drift to a melancholic tangent. <em>What would it be like if Takumi was here? Experiencing this serenity, laughing with Jesse not as his teacher but as something more …</em></p><p>Seeing the faraway look in Yugo’s eyes, Jesse tightens his grip on his hand. Yugo meets Jesse's gaze, finding understanding in those deep eyes. <em>Maybe, just maybe, a future with Jesse isn’t so far-fetched.</em></p><p>Yugo's internal musings are interrupted by Jesse’s teasing voice. “Hey, daydreamer, this breakfast isn’t going to eat itself.”</p><p>Chuckling, Yugo nods, squeezing Jesse’s hand back. “You’re right. To a beautiful day ahead.”</p><p>Jesse smiles warmly. “To us.”</p><p>Their glasses clink together, marking the start of yet another unforgettable day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The summer sun warms Yugo’s back as he strolls alongside Jesse, their steps in sync. They’ve managed to maintain a discreet distance, ensuring no prying eyes would spot them, especially Mrs. Kojima. It’s better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Their first stop: a museum where art and nature shake hands. The contemporary sculptures, placed meticulously, seem to converse with the surrounding green.</p><p>Jesse, with his usual playful flair, strikes the pose of an abstract statue. “Look, Yugo.” He grins. “I’m art!”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “Modern art,” he corrects with a smirk.</p><p>The pair later find themselves aboard a boat, sailing across Lake Ashi. The azure waters, framed by verdant mountains, serve as a reflection of nature’s untouched beauty.</p><p>Jesse snuggles closer, the gentle breeze making the warmth between them all the more profound. Yugo marvels at how effortlessly their fingers interlace.</p><p>The quaint toy shop by the lakeside is an unexpected gem. The window display — bursting with toy trains, miniature dinosaurs, and space-themed toys — beckons them inside.</p><p>“Look at this,” Yugo says, picking up a rocket-shaped piggy bank. Images of Takumi, starry-eyed and animated, come rushing back. “He’d love this.”</p><p>Jesse squeezes Yugo's hand in silent understanding. “He has your curiosity,” he observes, a soft smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Exiting the shop, they embark on a serene walk along an old cedar-lined path. Nature’s tranquility is palpable.</p><p>As they walk hand-in-hand, a vendor hawking traditional delicacies distracts them. Yugo, unable to resist, ends up buying a little more than necessary. “For later,” he winks at Jesse, referencing the potential midnight snack.</p><p>The day is a sensory overload: sights that steal their breath, tastes that dance on their tongues, and sounds that serenade their souls. By the river, as the day’s glow makes way for twilight, the two find a tranquil spot. Fish play hide-and-seek beneath the water's surface while lanterns nearby begin their luminous display.</p><p>Jesse’s fingers play with Yugo’s, their touch speaking volumes. “You know,” Jesse begins, his voice barely above a whisper. “I’ve never celebrated a birthday like this.”</p><p>Yugo meets Jesse's gaze, seeing the layers of gratitude there. He smiles softly. “Well, I’m glad I’m your first, then.”</p><p>As the world around them dims, Yugo finds solace resting his head on Jesse’s shoulder. Birthdays come and go, but what they’re building is timeless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo unlocks his apartment door, pushing it open slowly. Inside, he can see a chaotic scene. Daigo, sprawled on the floor amidst a mishmash of LEGO pieces, tries to assemble something that vaguely looks like a space station, while Juri, lounging on the couch, offers his expertise on how to put two bricks together.</p><p>“Why not use the manual?” Yugo asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Juri shrugs. “Too mainstream.”</p><p>Before the conversation can progress, Takumi charges at Yugo, wrapping tiny arms around his legs. “Daddy! I missed you!”</p><p>Yugo’s heart expands with warmth as he ruffles Takumi’s hair. “Missed you too, buddy. How was your time with Uncle Daigo and Juri?”</p><p>“Good! We’re building a space station. But it’s not as fun without you.”</p><p>“Oh?” Yugo chuckles, feeling a tug of guilt. “And how was your weekend?”</p><p>“It was okay. But I missed you,” Takumi says, a little pout forming. “How was your business trip?”</p><p>Guilt presses down, a weight on Yugo’s chest. “It was … productive,” he lies smoothly, trying to keep the playful atmosphere going. “I even got you something.” He takes out the small, rocket-shaped piggy bank.</p><p>Takumi’s eyes light up. “It’s amazing, Daddy! Thanks!”</p><p>As Takumi marvels at his new gift, Daigo decides to intervene. “Hey, champ, let’s find some coins for that rocket, huh?”</p><p>Takumi nods vigorously, allowing Daigo to whisk him away, leaving Yugo and Juri in the room.</p><p>Juri grins. “So, how was the honeymoon.”</p><p>Yugo blushes a shade of crimson. “It wasn’t a honeymoon,” he mumbles, avoiding eye contact. “And for your information, it was fun. But it just so happened that a fellow parent was in the same resort. Can you imagine? Luckily, she didn’t see us.”</p><p>Juri chuckles. “You sure are living on the wild side, Yugo. I’ve never seen you take a risk like this before. Jesse must be something special.”</p><p>Yugo runs a hand through his hair. “He is,” he admits softly. “But I hate lying to Takumi.”</p><p>Juri studies him for a moment. “You’ll tell him, when the time is right.”</p><p>A moment of silence follows, where Yugo appears contemplative.</p><p>“Jesse is really worth all this, isn’t he?” Juri breaks the silence.</p><p>Yugo looks out of the window, a small smile tugging at his lips. “I think he is. I truly believe he is.”</p><p>Their quiet moment is disrupted by a loud crash from Takumi’s room, followed by Daigo’s laughter.</p><p>Juri rolls his eyes playfully. “Meanwhile, your brother is as subtle as a bulldozer.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles.  “And you’re no better.”</p><p>Takumi and Daigo re-enter, the younger one holding his new piggy bank, half-filled with coins.</p><p>“Okay, what’s for dinner?” Daigo asks, flopping onto the couch, completely changing the topic.</p><p>Yugo smiles, pushing aside the feeling of guilt to catch up with his son.</p>

<p>Sunlight filters through the blinds, casting dancing golden patterns on the living room floor of the apartment. The hum of the city below and the chirping of a few rogue birds blend into the background. Inside, the room is alive with the mellifluous sounds of Jesse’s keyboard and Shintaro’s guitar.</p><p>Jesse, with a focus only a passionate pianist can muster, allows his fingers to glide across the black and white keys, each note an expression of emotion. Beside him, Shintaro strums his guitar with equal fervor, the chords and melodies intertwining in a soulful duet.</p><p>“There’s something magical about playing like this,” Jesse says with a grin, finishing off a particularly intricate piece. “Especially after, what, three months?”</p><p>Shintaro chuckles, lowering his guitar. “Music has this uncanny ability to make everything seem … right.” He pauses, then adds a wink. “Or, maybe it’s just the company.”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes playfully.</p><p>Just then, a message pings of Shintaro’s phone. “Ah! Speaking of company!” he exclaims, reading the text. “Guess who’s going on another spontaneous adventure with Marie?”</p><p>“Dare I even guess?” Jesse leans in, trying to catch a glimpse of the message.</p><p>“She wants us to join her on a midnight beach run. Again. The woman’s insatiable!” Shintaro sighs, a lovestruck smile on his face. “But, man, it’s invigorating.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles. “You and your whirlwind romance. Honestly, how do you keep up?”</p><p>Shintaro's eyes sparkle mischievously. “You have no idea, man. When she’s around, it feels like the world’s spinning just a little faster. There’s never a dull moment.” He stretches. “With her, it’s all impulsiveness. It’s like living in a constant high.”</p><p>Jesse’s fingers unconsciously drift to the piano keys, tapping a soft, contemplative melody. He smiles, a little wistfully. “It sounds exhilarating. But, there’s a charm to consistency, you know?”</p><p>“I knew it!” Shintaro points a finger dramatically. “This is about Single Dad, isn’t it?”</p><p>Jesse's face flushes. “It’s just … different,” he admits, thinking of the secret glances, the stolen moments, and the whispered conversations. “With Yugo, it’s less about spontaneous adventures and more about those silent moments that hold so much weight. There’s comfort in our routines, in the steady pulse of our relationship. But, sometimes I wonder …”</p><p>He's interrupted by Shintaro’s playful punch on his arm. “No second-guessing yourself, mister. Different isn’t bad. It’s just … different.”</p><p>Jesse smirks. “Thank you, oh wise one, for that profound observation.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Shintaro bows dramatically. “But seriously, remember what we always say? Every love story is unique. Yours is filled with secret notes and whispered love songs.”</p><p>“And yours?”</p><p>Shintaro grins. “Wild dances under the moon and crazy beach escapades.”</p><p>Both burst into laughter.</p><p>Jesse gazes at the setting sun. “You're right. Every relationship is unique. And I wouldn’t trade mine for the world.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With school out for the summer, Jesse and Yugo find themselves seizing every moment to be together. Cleverly orchestrated by Aya, Jesse is frequently invited to join playdates between Sakiko and Takumi. The playdates provide a perfect cover for the two men to spend quality time, away from prying eyes.</p><p>“Look, Jesse-sensei! I drew a T-Rex!” Takumi excitedly waves a piece of paper, showcasing his drawing.</p><p>“Wow, Takumi, that’s impressive!” Jesse admires, ruffling the boy’s hair.</p><p>Sakiko, not to be outdone, chimes in. “I wrote a story about a star who lost its shine. Do you want to hear it, Uncle Jesse?”</p><p>“I’d love to, Sakiko,” Jesse replies with a smile.</p><p>On one such occasion, as Sakiko and Takumi run around chasing each other, Aya sidles up to Jesse. She winks, saying softly, “Why don’t you go get some ice cream with Yugo? I’ll watch the kids.”</p><p>Gratefully, Jesse nods. “Thanks. You’re the best.”</p><p>Amusement parks become their next escape, where Jesse and Yugo pretend to be nothing more than two fathers ensuring their kids have a good time.</p><p>“Jesse, think the kids will enjoy the carousel?” Yugo asks, masking the intimacy of their proximity with casual conversation.</p><p>“Oh, absolutely. Takumi and Sakiko will love it,” Jesse responds, sneaking a quick glance at Yugo.</p><p>But it’s during the evening strolls that they truly connect. With Takumi and Sakiko engrossed in conversations about space, dinosaurs, and stories, Yugo softly says, “I cherish these moments with you.”</p><p>Jesse squeezes Yugo’s hand. “Me too,” he replies. “It feels … right.”</p><p>Aya, ever the protective sister, often shoots a concerned glance towards Jesse. One night, as they’re walking home, she approaches him, letting Yugo walk next to Takumi. “You sure about all this, Jesse? It’s not just fun and games.”</p><p>“I know, Aya,” Jesse murmurs. “But with Yugo, it feels worth the risk.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s a bright summer afternoon as Yugo knocks on the door of Jesse’s apartment, a neatly written list of venues and caterers in hand. Jesse welcomes him in, giving him a quick kiss before closing the door behind them.</p><p>“I can’t believe it’s already time to start planning Takumi’s birthday party,” Jesse says as they settle onto the couch. “He’s growing up so fast.”</p><p>Yugo smiles, love for his son evident on his face. “I know. It feels like just yesterday he was taking his first steps. Now, he’s about to turn seven.”</p><p>Jesse grins, imagining a tiny Takumi wobbling across the room. “So, should we go with a space or dinosaur theme this year?”</p><p>“I think he’d love either,” Yugo replies. “Though he has been talking nonstop about astronauts lately. Maybe we could do an outer space party at that children’s museum with the planetarium.”</p><p>“That’s a great idea!” Jesse says. “We could decorate the event room with rockets and planets.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles at his enthusiasm. “It’s settled then. A space adventure it is.” He glances down at his list. “I called them this morning and they had an opening for the Saturday afternoon after the next.”</p><p>As Yugo meticulously goes over venue details, Jesse’s mind wanders to the games and activities they could plan. “What if we turn the kids into little astronauts and have them complete space missions to rescue alien stuffed animals or something?”</p><p>Yugo smiles, eyes bright. “Takumi would love that. You always come up with the most creative ideas.”</p><p>Warmth fills Jesse’s chest at the compliment.</p><p>The banter continues as they delve deeper into the planning. At one point, Yugo shares a past memory, “You know, for his fourth birthday, Takumi insisted on being a tree. Not a superhero, not an animal. A tree.”</p><p>Jesse bursts into laughter. “A tree? Oh, that kid!” He then adds, “That’s so him. Always going against the grain.”</p><p>Yugo grins. “Exactly. And speaking of grain...” He pulls out a photo from his wallet, showing a tiny Takumi covered head to toe in cake. “This was last year.”</p><p>Jesse nearly chokes on his drink. “That’s adorable! But how on earth did that happen?”</p><p>Yugo shakes his head, chuckling. “Let’s just say he thought he could become the cake. The magician we hired didn’t help either. His trick was … let’s say less magic, more tragic.”</p><p>The two dissolve into fits of laughter.</p><p>The mood light and playful, spend the next hour finalizing catering (Daigo, unquestionably), entertainment (an “astronaut training obstacle course” and a planetarium experience afterward), and the guest list.</p><p>Jesse hesitates slightly when parents are mentioned, but Yugo gives his hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’re coming as Sakiko’s uncle, remember? No one has to know.”</p><p>Jesse’s heart flutters at the words. <em>Oh, this man</em>.</p><p>As the afternoon melts into evening, they’ve compiled a comprehensive party plan. Jesse stretches, joints stiff from sitting too long. “I think that’s everything,” he says.</p><p>“This will be his best birthday yet,” Yugo declares. “Thank you for all your help, Jesse. You didn’t have to spend your whole Saturday for this.”</p><p>“Of course I did,” Jesse replies softly. “I’d do anything for you and Takumi.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes darken, and he leans in, lips meeting Jesse’s in a slow, tender kiss. Jesse winds an arm around Yugo’s waist, drawing him closer as the kiss deepens, both getting lost in each other.</p><p>When they finally break apart, breaths coming quicker, Jesse rests his forehead against Yugo’s. “Why don’t you stay the night?” he murmurs. “Shintaro won’t be back until tomorrow.”</p><p>Yugo answers by pulling Jesse into another searing kiss, hands roaming. As they stumble together toward the bedroom, party planning is quickly forgotten.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In a tranquil corner of a park, amidst the soft chirping of crickets and the distant laughter of children, Jesse and Yugo find a bench that promises a quiet haven. They sit close, their fingers entwined, while the leaves of nearby trees rustle, whispering secrets to each other. For Jesse, this setting is everything—intimate, special, and away from the chaos.</p><p>Yugo leans in, his lips brushing against Jesse’s temple, a hint of a smile playing on his face. “Quiet places like these,” he murmurs, “they’re our little escapes, aren’t they?”</p><p>Jesse chuckles softly, his heart doing a tiny somersault. “Until we’re discovered, yeah.” The perpetual fear of exposure looms over him like a storm cloud. A public park wasn’t exactly the best location for a secret date. But in that moment, the world fades, leaving just the two of them.</p><p>As their conversation drifts between personal anecdotes and playful banter, Yugo's laughter fills the evening air. Jesse's thoughts run wild. <em>Damn, I’d risk it all for this moment. Just one kiss.</em></p><p>But as Jesse’s lips brush against Yugo’s, there's a sudden gasp that shatters the serenity. Pulling away, they turn to see Taiga, his eyes wide but holding a knowing smirk.</p><p>“Well, well,” he drawls, “look what the cat dragged in.”</p><p>Yugo looks like a deer caught in headlights. Jesse, however, springs to action, shooting Taiga a look.</p><p>“It’s okay, Yugo, Taiga knows, he promised he won’t tell," Jesse says. He then turns to Taiga again. “Hey,” he begins, his voice cool.</p><p>But before he can continue, Taiga cuts him off. “No time! Hurry and get out of here before he arrives.” The panic is evident in Taiga’s voice.</p><p>Before Jesse can ask who “he” is, Hokuto appears, holding two cans that glisten with condensation from the summer heat. Hokuto looks between the two men, a puzzled expression forming. “Jesse? Kochi-san? What’s going on?”</p><p>Taiga, the knight in shining armor, steps in. “Just ran into each other. Kochi-san was heading home and Jesse needed a quiet spot for a call, and we ran into each other like this.”</p><p>Hokuto’s gaze remains sharp, almost calculating. He isn’t easily deceived. “Really?” he asks, looking between the two.</p><p>“Yeah.” Yugo nods quickly. “I was just heading out. You know, opposite direction and all.” He looks discreetly at Jesse, a silent promise to reconvene later.</p><p>Jesse nods, trying to keep his face neutral. “See you around, Kochi-san.”</p><p>Hokuto seems still unconvinced but lets it go. “Alright then.”</p><p>With a brief nod to the group, Yugo disappears into the twilight.</p><p>Hokuto turns to Taiga. “We should get going.”</p><p>Taiga chuckles nervously. “Okay. Give me a couple of minutes with Jesse, though?”</p><p>Jesse feels like an outsider, watching the interaction between Taiga and Hokuto. There’s a subtle tension, and it doesn’t escape him. When Hokuto moves slightly closer to Taiga, Jesse’s eyebrows shoot up. The dynamic is clear.</p><p><em>No way</em>.</p><p>When Hokuto leaves, Taiga meets Jesse’s eyes, a sheepish grin on his face. “Guess you’re not the only one with secrets,” he teases.</p><p>Jesse smirks. “Dating Hokuto, are we?”</p><p>Taiga blushes, a rare sight. “Maybe,” he mumbles.</p><p>A light chuckle escapes Jesse’s lips. “Look at us, two grown men sneaking around in parks."</p><p>Taiga nudges Jesse playfully. “Speak for yourself. But seriously, be careful. Hokuto’s sharp. I can’t cover for you guys forever.”</p><p>Jesse nods. “We’ll be more discreet. Promise.”</p><p>Taiga offers a soft smile, “I’m happy for you, Jesse.”</p><p>Jesse returns the smile. “And I’m happy for you.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse steps into a discount store nestled at the corner of a bustling summer street. He’s there for a reason, of course: to buy Takumi a birthday gift.</p><p>The store’s interior is a pandemonium of colors and items, and Jesse walks back and forth between the galaxy-patterned mugs to life-sized, albeit plastic, Velociraptors. Jesse immediately finds himself gravitating towards the space-themed items. He can already see Takumi’s face lighting up.</p><p>While skimming the space section, a particular pendant catches his eye. Not space or dino-themed, but something much deeper. Two figures, presumably adults, with a smaller one in the center, all hand in hand. The essence of family.</p><p>Holding it in his hand, he’s hit with a rush of possibilities: morning cuddles, uproarious laughter echoing through a shared home, and comforting bedtime stories.</p><p><em>Could that be us?</em> Jesse wonders, imagining himself, Yugo, and Takumi as the little unit the pendant depicts. He can’t help but daydream.</p><p>But it's not long before the uncertainty kicks in. He pictures school meetings, fellow parents whispering, eyebrows raising. Takumi’s innocent eyes clouding with questions he’s too young to understand.</p><p>Jesse places the pendant back. It’s a silent promise to himself and to the future he sees with Yugo and Takumi. Not now, but someday.</p><p>A voice brings him back from his daydream. “Looking for something?” It’s a store assistant.</p><p>“Yeah,” Jesse replies. “Something out-of-this-world or … prehistoric? It’s for a kid’s birthday.”</p><p>She chuckles. “Got just the thing!” She shows him a glow-in-the-dark dinosaur that also projects constellations when it’s dark.</p><p>His face lights up. “It’s like space and dinosaurs had a baby!”</p><p>The store assistant giggles. “Right? It’s been a hit with the kids. Combines the best of both worlds.”</p><p>Jesse looks at the toy, thinking about Takumi’s delight. “I’ll take it!”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The summer sun casts a golden glow on the children’s museum's exterior, making it look like a structure from another planet. Jesse’s eyes, as wide as a kid entering a candy store, take in the space-themed setup.</p><p><em>If every classroom was this engaging, we’d produce geniuses by the dozen,</em> he thinks.</p><p>He looks around and spots Yugo, looking dapper as always, albeit a bit frazzled as he tries to get a helium planet under control. It seems to have taken a liking to his hair.</p><p>“Need a hand there, Kochi-san?” Jesse asks, trying to stifle his chuckles.</p><p>Yugo raises an eyebrow, shooting him a mock-annoyed glare. “Yes please, Jesse-sensei. You’d think organizing a birthday party for the past six years would prepare me for this. Apparently not.”</p><p>Jesse plucks the rogue planet from Yugo’s hair, grinning. “Seems like Jupiter’s got a crush on you.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, shaking his head. “As long as it’s just planets and not other parents.”</p><p>The quip causes a playful slap on Yugo’s arm. “Behave, Kochi-san. We’re in a room full of kids.”</p><p>Speaking of which, an exuberant voice cuts in. “Jesse-sensei!” It's Takumi, dashing towards him in a mini astronaut suit, looking every bit ready for a moonwalk.</p><p>“Commander Takumi.” Jesse salutes, getting a delighted giggle in return. “Ready to train for the next space mission?”</p><p>Takumi nods enthusiastically. “Yes! But only if you join.”</p><p>Gazing at the obstacle course, Jesse thinks he’s more cut out for blackboards than balance beams, but he mentally shakes his head. “Alright, let’s conquer space!”</p><p>The next fifteen minutes consist of Jesse showcasing his rather <em>unique</em> astronaut training techniques, including an exaggerated moonwalk that has kids and adults laughing alike. From the corner, he spots Yugo with his phone up, no doubt snapping pictures.</p><p>Post obstacle course antics, the children are shepherded into the planetarium. Jesse finds himself beside Yugo, their fingers brushing.</p><p>Yugo leans in, whispering, “You have got to give me a copy of that moonwalk. It’s payback for every future argument.”</p><p>Jesse snorts. “Deal. But only if we use it as our official dance move.”</p><p>Inside the planetarium, a symphony of ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ fills the air. The ceiling is alive with swirling galaxies, meteors, and constellations.</p><p>As the tour ends, they return to Daigo rolling in the cake. Takumi’s joyous face, framed by the rocket-shaped cake’s candy smoke, captures the room’s attention.</p><p>Post-birthday song and post-cake cutting, as kids dive into their slices, Jesse seizes the opportunity to give Takumi his gift.</p><p>The young boy’s eyes light up at the glow-in-the-dark dinosaur. “It’s like my two favorite things combined!” Takumi exclaims, wrapping Jesse in a tight hug.</p><p>Jesse pats his back. “Happy birthday, Takumi.”</p><p>As they pull apart, Takumi adds, “You’re my favorite teacher, Jesse-sensei.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, his heart full. “Thanks, Commander. Now, go enjoy your space-dino.”</p><p>Looking over Takumi’s head, Jesse meets Yugo’s eyes. There’s warmth there, a silent promise shared between the two. In that fleeting moment, amidst the raucous party, the two men share a universe of their own.</p><p>Maybe someday, Jesse thinks, the three of them can be just like that pendant — a close-knit family.</p><p>For now, these stolen moments will do.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The summer festival is a spectacle of colors and sounds, where lanterns painted the streets of gold, and drums pulsated in everyone’s chest. Jesse can’t help but marvel at the twinkling stalls. Each stall offers a treat, a trinket, or a memory to be made.</p><p>And with Yugo by his side, everything feels brighter.</p><p>“Look.” Jesse points to a stall. “The kids would love those.”</p><p>Yugo smiles and nods. Soon, they have a plastic bag with some trinkets—one for Sakiko and another for Takumi.</p><p>With their hands intertwined, the pair drift from one stall to another, losing themselves in the shared laughter and momentary freedom. <em>It’s almost like a dream</em>, Jesse thinks.</p><p>However, that dream is punctured when Jesse’s gaze falls on Taiga, who's now laughingly feeding cotton candy to Hokuto.</p><p>The world narrows. Taiga wilts under Jesse’s gaze, his eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>Hokuto, with his sharpness, notices where Taiga is looking and his own eyes widen. The atmosphere thickens.</p><p>“Yugo,” Jesse murmurs, releasing his hand on instinct. “Maybe we should—”</p><p>But before he can finish, Hokuto’s pace is quick, and Taiga’s attempts to pull him away fail. “I knew it,” Hokuto says. “I knew there was something suspicious with how you’re always close to Kochi-san.”</p><p>Jesse tries to change the subject, the festival’s lively beat becoming an oppressive drum in his ears. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about—”</p><p>“This isn’t appropriate, Jesse.” He turns to Yugo. “Neither for you, Kochi-san, with all due respect. But think about Takumi. The news spreads once it gets out.”</p><p>Jesse suddenly feels a hand on his arm, and he turns to see Aya. Fortunately, Takumi and Sakiko are out of earshot, so they must be with Daigo.</p><p>“Hello,” she greets brightly, but Jesse notices the seriousness in her eyes. “I think you should talk about this someplace else. You’re right, Matsumura-sensei. The news spreads fast, but not if you talk about it in the right place. Besides”—She glances over at Takumi and Sakiko, who are playing with their pinwheels with Daigo—“we don’t want the kids to be listening.”</p><p>Hokuto considers it for a moment before nodding. “Just … think it through. The both of you,” he says before he takes Taiga’s hand and walks away.</p><p>The three of them stand there in silence before Yugo reaches for his hand. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Jesse lets out a sharp breath he didn’t know he had been holding. “No …”</p><p>“The fireworks start soon,” Aya points out. “I’ll … give you two a moment.” She pats Jesse on the arm before returning to Daigo and the children.</p><p>Yugo’s brows are furrowed. “Jesse … we can talk about it …”</p><p>Jesse forces a smile and shakes his head. “Not today.” He takes another deep breath to ease the tension in his body. “Maybe later. Wouldn’t want to ruin the festival for the kids.”</p><p>Yugo looks unconvinced, but he relents, pressing his lips on Jesse’s knuckles. “Okay.”</p><p>But Jesse still thinks about it, even as the night sky bursts into a kaleidoscope of colors. He has prepared to risk all of this, all for Yugo, but now that more people know … and with Takumi’s well-being …</p><p>… is this still worth it, after all?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In Yugo’s apartment, the blue hues of the night paint a serene picture on the walls. The remnants of the fireworks festival shimmer in the distance, each burst of color a vivid reminder of the afternoon’s events.</p><p>The festival’s beauty is now entwined with the complexity of Yugo’s feelings. As he gazes out, each vibrant explosion reflects the passionate moments shared with Jesse, while the trailing smoke shadows their uncertain future.</p><p><em>Why does love have to be so complicated?</em> he muses.</p><p>The festival had been a celebration of summer, love, and life. Yet, beneath the sparkling spectacle, the confrontation with Hokuto had tested the resilience of their secret relationship. The stern gaze of Hokuto, like a laser pointer in the dark, still haunts Yugo.</p><p>“Shit,” Yugo murmurs, feeling the weight of those moments. The risk of their liaison had never been more palpable. The backlash, the whispers behind closed doors, the impact on Takumi—it all swirls in Yugo’s mind.</p><p>From the adjoining room, he hears the low hum of Takumi’s sleep machine—a gentle reminder of the reason behind all his decisions. <em>My boy can’t get caught up in this mess</em>.</p><p>Then, the lingering scent of ramen broth wafts through the room. Daigo must’ve whipped up a late-night meal. But tonight, food is the last thing on Yugo’s mind.</p><p>Yugo’s phone buzzes on the coffee table. It’s Jesse. A simple message: “You okay?”</p><p>For a moment, Yugo hesitates, thumb hovering over the keyboard. He then quickly types back. “Thinking. You?”</p><p>“Same,” comes the prompt reply. “Wanna talk?”</p><p>He dials Jesse’s number, each ring echoing the anxious beats of his heart. Jesse answers, and Yugo’s immediately comforted by the familiar timbre of his voice, albeit a touch weary.</p><p>“Today was … a lot,” Jesse starts.</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “Understatement of the year.”</p><p>They both laugh, a brief interlude in the gravity of the conversation. Their banter, light and teasing, is a salve on the sting of the day’s events.</p><p>“I’m worried, Yugo,” Jesse admits. “But not about us. About Takumi. I don’t want our decisions to hurt them.”</p><p>Yugo sighs. “I know. I feel the same. But hiding forever isn’t a solution either.”</p><p>Jesse hums. “Maybe we should meet up, away from everyone, just to sort things out.”</p><p>Yugo nods, even though Jesse can’t see him. “I’d like that.”</p><p>The city’s sounds filter through the window—distant chatter, music, the rustling of leaves. Both men are silent for a moment, lost in thought, the weight of their decisions pressing on them.</p><p>Finally, Yugo speaks, determination clear in his voice. “Look, Jesse, I don’t know what the future holds. But what I do know is that I don’t want to face it without you.”</p><p>Jesse lets out a breath, as if he’s been holding it in forever. “Neither do I.”</p><p>“We’ll figure it out, okay?” Yugo continues. “One step at a time. Together.”</p><p>“Together,” Jesse echoes, a smile evident in his voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo watches from the balcony as Daigo energetically ruffles Takumi’s hair, both of them laughing. The bond between uncle and nephew is evident, even from this distance.</p><p>“Enjoy the day, you two! And tell Mom not to feed him too much candy, Daigo!” Yugo calls out.</p><p>Daigo throws a mock salute, his face full of mischief. “No promises!” With a final wave, they disappear from sight, leaving Yugo in a rare moment of solitude.</p><p>He and Jesse had promised to talk that day. And Yugo and Daigo talked about it, and they decided that it would be better if Takumi stay over at her grandmother’s in Yokohama so Yugo and Jesse could have a full day to talk. Daigo was more than willing to go home with Takumi, and besides, their mother had been wanting to spoil her grandson.</p><p>He’s brought back to the moment by a knock at the door. It’s precisely four o’clock.</p><p>“Hey,” Yugo greets, his eyes lingering a little longer on Jesse’s face. The weight of the situation makes their greeting more reserved than either would like. “Come on in.”</p><p>Jesse steps in, looking around the apartment. “Nice place you have here.” The simple statement carries an underlying tone of anticipation.</p><p>“Thanks.” Yugo grins, leading the way. “Let me give you a tour.”</p><p>They move from room to room, with Yugo pointing out little tidbits about each space. When they reach Takumi’s bedroom, Jesse's face lights up. “A space-themed room? You weren’t kidding when you said he likes space!”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “More like obsessed. I’m already working my ass off because I can already see him preparing to become a JAXA astronaut. Or he’s gonna take a paleontology degree.”</p><p>Jesse laughs. “Ambitious kid.”</p><p>The tour takes a somber turn when they reach the small altar of Haruka. Pictures of a smiling woman with kind eyes gaze back at them.</p><p>Jesse steps forward and whispers, “Hello, Haruka-san. I’m Jesse. Thank you for watching over Yugo and Takumi.”</p><p>Yugo feels a lump in his throat. He didn’t expect Jesse to acknowledge Haruka, and the gesture tugs at his heartstrings.</p><p>They sit across from each other on floor cushions, a low coffee table between them. The late afternoon sun filters through the blinds, casting the room in a warm glow. A tense silence hangs in the air. Both men know they need to discuss the future, but neither is sure how to begin.</p><p>Finally, Jesse breaks the quiet. “Yugo … where do we go from here?” he asks hesitantly.</p><p>Yugo keeps his eyes downcast, staring at the flickering candle on the table. “I’ve been wondering the same thing,” he admits.</p><p>The memory of running into Hokuto still weighs heavily on both their minds. The look of shock on the man’s face when he saw them together was sobering. It drove home just how much is at stake if anyone else discovers their secret relationship.</p><p>“I just keep thinking about Takumi,” Jesse continues anxiously. “If this got out …”</p><p>He doesn’t need to finish the thought. They both know the undue attention it could bring Takumi at school if people found out his father was dating his homeroom teacher.</p><p>Yugo nods solemnly. “I worry what it might do to your career too,” he replies.</p><p>The unspoken words hang thick in the room. This beautiful, unexpected thing they’ve found together suddenly seems so fragile. The outside world looms like a threatening storm ready to batter their delicate bond.</p><p>Desperate to voice the happiness Jesse has brought him before it’s too late, Yugo forges ahead.</p><p>“But then I think about Takumi’s birthday,” he says softly. “When I looked over at Takumi hugging you after you gave him his gift … it just felt so right.”</p><p>Jesse smiles faintly at the memory, but his eyes glisten. “Or when you let me join your family this past summer. No one has ever made me feel that included before.”</p><p>One by one, they recount cherished moments they’ve shared, painting a mosaic of the joy they’ve found in each other. Laughter at 3 AM convenience store runs. Long talks over cups of coffee. Gentle teasing and playful nudges.</p><p>Jesse takes a shaky breath, the atmosphere growing heavy with emotion. “You’ve changed my life, Yugo. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart swells at the admission. “Before you, after Haruka passed away … there was this emptiness inside me. But being with you has filled that void in a way I never thought possible again.”</p><p>Their voices drop to hushed tones as they delve deeper, giving voice to dreams and wishes long left unspoken.</p><p>Jesse shyly admits he could see himself being a father figure to Takumi one day. Yugo hesitates only a moment before confessing he wishes for that too.</p><p>They speak of someday sharing a home together, merging their lives in the open instead of snatched moments behind closed doors. Of waking up beside each other each morning rather than lonely nights spent apart.</p><p>But discussions of the future also dredge up fears. Yugo frets over people’s reactions to their relationship. And Jesse voices his deepest worry — that the fallout could harm the innocent child who brought them together.</p><p>As the conversation grows heavy with emotion, their true feelings for each other shine through. Yugo has never met someone in years that he connects with on such a profound level. And Jesse has never allowed himself to be this vulnerable with another person before.</p><p>The pure joy they’ve found in each other radiates like a beacon, cutting through the gloom of outside pressures trying to smother their light.</p><p>Finally, Jesse utters the three words he's held back until now, his voice choked with feeling.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>The confession hangs in the air, momentous and heavy. When Yugo meets his gaze with tear-filled eyes, the words spill out in kind.</p><p>“I love you too. So much.”</p><p>The exchange brings a sense of clarity, like clouds parting after a storm. They love each other. And come what may, they will protect and nurture that love.</p><p>As the sun sinks below the horizon, Yugo and Jesse make a promise. To be more careful and discreet going forward. But also never to let fear or societal pressures break the precious bond they now share.</p><p>A comfortable silence settles between them, their hands loosely joined across the table. For the first time, the future feels not quite so ominous. They have each other. And together, they can weather whatever comes next.</p><p>As night falls, Yugo glances at the clock. It’s nearly eight in the evening already.</p><p>“Why don’t you stay over tonight?” he suggests softly. “Daigo won’t be back with Takumi until tomorrow afternoon.”</p><p>Jesse considers the offer, then nods. “Okay.”</p><p>They stand and Yugo leads him to the bedroom. As soon as the door closes behind them, their mouths meet hungrily, pent up longing spilling over.</p><p>Yugo slides his hands under Jesse’s shirt, splaying his fingers across the warm, smooth skin of his back. Jesse sighs into the kiss, pulling Yugo flush against him.</p><p>Their movements grow more heated, hands roaming eagerly as clothing is shed piece by piece. When they finally tumble into bed, skin against skin, Yugo thinks his heart might burst from sheer happiness.</p><p>Here, cocooned away from prying eyes and disapproving gazes, they’re able to simply be themselves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo takes a deep breath as he approaches the front entrance of his son’s elementary school. As he reaches for the handle of the double doors of the entranceway, his grip tightens. He checks his phone again, but there are still no new messages from Jesse.</p><p>It’s the first day back after summer vacation, and Yugo is filled with an unusual sense of dread. Just an hour ago, he received a call from the school secretary, requesting that he come in to meet with the principal, Mr. Yoshida. The urgency in her voice put Yugo on high alert. His mind races with speculation about what this could be about.</p><p>As Yugo steps inside, his legs feel heavier than usual. He straightens his tie reflexively, as if the extra formality could ward off whatever news awaits him.</p><p>Walking down the hallway, Yugo is assailed by memories. He remembers walking to the faculty room for a parent-teacher conference. He remembers the shock of realizing that Takumi’s homeroom teacher was a handsome once-stranger he met at a rooftop bar in Shibuya.</p><p>Now, the fluorescent lights of the hallway seem harsh instead of warm. Yugo’s shoes squeak loudly on the polished floors. The school is not yet filled with the chaos of children, making the emptiness feel eerie.</p><p>Approaching the heavy wooden door of the principal’s office, Yugo hesitates. He takes a steadying breath before knocking lightly.</p><p>“Come in,” Mr. Yoshida’s stern voice calls out.</p><p>Yugo enters the office slowly. It feels smaller than he expected. The aging wood paneling and dated furniture give the room a sense of gloom. Mr. Yoshida sits rigidly behind his large desk, surveying Yugo over his glasses. His lips form a tight line, expression unreadable.</p><p>“Have a seat, Kochi-san,” Mr. Yoshida says formally, motioning to the chair across from him.</p><p>Yugo perches anxiously on the edge of the seat. “Is everything alright? Is Takumi okay?” he asks nervously.</p><p>Mr. Yoshida’s stern gaze reveals nothing. “Takumi is fine. This meeting concerns … other matters.”</p><p>Yugo nods uncertainly. He tries to appear outwardly calm despite the dread twisting his insides.</p><p>Mr. Yoshida folds his hands on the desk. For several agonizing moments, he simply looks at Yugo over his interlaced fingers. The only sound is the ticking of a clock on the wall.</p><p>Yugo grows more unsettled with each passing second. His mind floods with possibilities, each thought darker than the last.</p><p>After what feels like an eternity, Mr. Yoshida finally breaks the heavy silence. Without a word, he slides a photograph across the desk toward Yugo.</p><p>Yugo’s chest seizes when he sees the image. It’s blurry and obviously taken from a distance, but the scene is unmistakable. Two men sit close together on a park bench, fingers interlaced. Despite the poor quality, Yugo recognizes himself and Jesse immediately.</p><p>He recognizes this photo. It was during a playdate that Aya had organized for Sakiko and Takumi. Aya had given them the opportunity to have a quiet moment.</p><p>Yugo’s mouth goes dry, dread pooling in his gut. All other sounds fade away, his focus zeroed in on the incriminating photograph. It’s a private moment captured carelessly for all to see.</p><p>“One of my teachers brought this to me today,” Mr. Yoshida says evenly. “They saw you together at the park. Quite by accident, it seems.”</p><p>Yugo’s hands curl into fists under the desk. Jesse and Yugo had been so careful, stealing moments together only in secluded places. But clearly, it had not been enough.</p><p>Mr. Yoshida leans forward, steepling his fingers under his chin. “You know we cannot condone this kind of fraternization between parents and teachers, Kochi-san. It raises … concerns.”</p><p>Yugo nods wordlessly, his tongue frozen. He thinks of Jesse, wonders if he has already endured this meeting. Guilt crashes over Yugo as he realizes Jesse’s job could be at risk. And for what? A few secret dates, a fledgling romance? The cost feels devastatingly steep.</p><p>“I’ve already spoken with Jesse-sensei,” Mr. Yoshida continues, as if reading Yugo’s mind. “He’s been placed on temporary leave pending a full investigation. What we’ll tell the children is that their homeroom teacher had fallen ill and won’t be back until the week after. If the Board decides to keep him, that is.”</p><p>The words land like a blow. Yugo’s thoughts race to Jesse, picturing him alone and distraught over the day’s events. And poor Takumi, resuming classes under the shadow of this scandal. The stakes feel impossibly high all because of a few stolen moments together.</p><p>“I understand why you’re concerned,” Yugo begins slowly. “But Jesse … Jesse-sensei is an exceptional teacher. This is all my fault, I take full responsibility—”</p><p>Mr. Yoshida cuts him off with a raised hand. “The policies exist for good reason, Kochi-san. I’m sure you understand.” His tone leaves no room for debate. “My priority is protecting the students and the reputation of this school. Which is why Jesse-sensei will remain on leave while we investigate fully.”</p><p>Yugo opens his mouth to protest, then thinks better of it. Arguing further will only make things worse.</p><p>“In the meantime,” Mr. Yoshida continues, “I trust you will do your best not to interfere with the investigation.” He levels a pointed look at Yugo.</p><p>“O-Of course,” Yugo stammers. He feels backed into a corner, grasping for some semblance of control over the situation. But Yoshida clearly has the upper hand here.</p><p>“Very good.” Mr. Yoshida stands abruptly, signaling the end of the meeting. “I appreciate your discretion in this matter. Tell Takumi we look forward to seeing him again on Monday.”</p><p>Yugo rises slowly on unsteady legs. The conversation has left him reeling, fearful for what comes next. He has so many unanswered questions. What will happen to Jesse? And Takumi’s school year?</p><p>Numbly, Yugo leaves the office. But instead of relief, the expansive school hallway only amplifies his unease. The once-comforting walls and displays of student artwork now feel suffocating.</p><p>Yugo quickens his pace toward the exit. The morning sunlight outside is disorienting after the darkness of the office. Yugo takes a few deep breaths, trying to slow his racing heart.</p><p>As the shock wears off, deeper emotions take hold. Fear. Anger. Frustration. Jesse’s face, crestfallen, floats in Yugo's mind.</p><p>Yugo pulls out his phone again. Still no messages. His fingers tighten around the device as the helplessness fully hits him.</p><p>Yugo starts moving down the sidewalk. He needs to see Jesse. Make sure he’s okay. They need to talk and figure this out. Yugo knows where Jesse will be — his apartment.</p><p>Yugo picks up his pace, determination settling over him. No more hiding, no more shame over wanting to be with Jesse. If their relationship has somehow hurt Takumi or Jesse’s career, they will make it right. But Yugo refuses to lose this man who has come to mean so much, so quickly.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s fingers drum impatiently against the side of his pants, his nervous energy palpable as he stands outside the nondescript door of Jesse’s apartment. With a deep breath, he finally presses the doorbell.</p><p>There’s a shuffle of footsteps, and the door swings open to reveal a tall man with an infectious grin and disheveled hair. Shintaro. Even without introductions, Yugo would recognize him from Jesse's stories.</p><p>“You must be Yugo!” the man exclaims, extending his hand. “I’m Shintaro, Jesse’s roommate.”</p><p>Yugo shakes his head, nodding. “Nice to meet you. Jesse’s told me about you.”</p><p>“All terrible things, I hope.” Shintaro laughs. He steps aside and waves Yugo in. “Come on in. I had a feeling you’d be coming over.”</p><p>Yugo nods gravely. “I just came from school. The principal told me what happened. Where’s Jesse?”</p><p>“He’s been holed up in his room all day,” Shintaro replies. “I figured he needed some space to process everything.”</p><p>Yugo sighs. “I can’t help feeling responsible for getting him into this situation.”</p><p>Shintaro waves a hand dismissively. ”Jesse’s a big boy. He knew the risks when he got involved with you. We all make our own choices in life. And to be honest, <em>I</em>, and probably several other people around you two, encouraged it. So the blame shouldn’t be on just the both of you.” He smiles and pats Yugo’s shoulder reassuringly. “Anyway, his room is just down the hall if you want to go talk to him.” He stands up. “I’ll go for a walk and I’ll give you some space.”</p><p>Yugo thanks him and heads down the hallway Shintaro indicated. He pauses outside the closed door, steadying his nerves before knocking softly.</p><p>“Jesse? It’s me,” he calls out gently.</p><p>A muffled voice answers for him to come in. Yugo turns the knob and steps inside. His heart sinks at the sight of Jesse sprawled listlessly across his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His eyes are ringed with dark circles, his face etched with fatigue.</p><p>Yugo lingers in the doorway. “Can I come in?”</p><p>Jesse glances over and nods before returning his gaze upward. Yugo crosses the room and perches gingerly on the edge of the bed. The bed dips as he sits, reaching out to brush a stray hair from Jesse’s forehead. “I’m so sorry,” he murmurs.</p><p>Jesse captures Yugo’s hand, pressing it against his cheek. “Don’t apologize. We knew something like this might happen eventually.”</p><p>Yugo looks down at his hands. “Doesn’t make it any easier though, does it?”</p><p>Jesse just sighs in response.</p><p>They sit in heavy silence for a few moments before Yugo speaks again.</p><p>“So … what do we do now?”</p><p>With effort, Jesse pushes himself upright and takes Yugo's hands in his own, gently caressing his knuckles. His eyes are clouded with pain and Yugo knows what’s coming even before Jesse begins to speak.</p><p>“We have to keep our distance, at least until the investigation is over,” Jesse says quietly. “We can’t risk being seen together. It’ll make things worse.”</p><p>Yugo swallows hard but nods in understanding. “You’re right, of course. We have to think of Takumi now, too. More than ever.”</p><p>Jesse’s expression crumples briefly at the mention of Takumi, but he quickly rearranges his features. “I might stay at a friend’s place for a bit, just to be safe.”</p><p>Yugo’s chest aches, but he forces a smile. “I’m really going to miss you.” He leans in and kisses Jesse softly, trying to convey all his jumbled emotions in the contact.</p><p>Jesse returns the kiss before pulling back regretfully. “I know,” he whispers. “I’ll miss you too. So much.”</p><p>Yugo brushes a tender hand across Jesse’s cheek. Then, with great effort, he stands and steps away. “Call me when you can,” he says over his shoulder.</p><p>Jesse nods, eyes never leaving Yugo as he crosses the room and lets himself out, closing the door with a quiet click behind him.</p><p>Yugo stands motionless in the hallway for a long moment, emotions churning. He knew this was a possibility, but having to actually implement this distance between them feels like a vise around his heart.</p><p>With a heavy exhales, he pushes off the wall and heads out of the apartment.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo sits alone in the dimly lit living room, the only light coming from a single lamp in the corner. He scrolls through the photos on his phone, taking in every detail of Jesse’s face — his warm eyes, his playful smile, the mole on his cheek.</p><p>Yugo’s chest aches as he traces the contours of Jesse's face on the screen. The weight of their impossible situation, combined with the quiet stillness of the night, makes his sadness feel even more profound. A single tear escapes, rolling down his cheek.</p><p>Suddenly, a shuffle breaks his melancholy. Turning, Yugo finds Takumi, his hair a wild mess, clutching his favorite green T-Rex plushie and rubbing his eyes.</p><p>“Daddy …?” he mumbles.</p><p>Quickly, Yugo wipes away the tear and locks his phone. “Hey there, little astronaut,” he says softly, attempting a cheerful façade. “What are you doing up?”</p><p>Padding closer, Takumi clambers up next to him, nestling into Yugo’s side. “Went potty,” he mumbles, “then saw you … sad.”</p><p>Yugo sighs, his façade crumbling, pulling his son closer. “Sometimes, grown-ups get sad, too. You know, just like how you feel when your favorite toy goes missing.”</p><p>Takumi nods against his chest. “Why are you sad, Daddy?”</p><p>Yugo considers how to explain this to a seven-year-old. “Well, you see, Daddy loves someone very much,” he begins slowly. “But it’s … complicated. And sometimes loving someone can be really hard.”</p><p>Takumi frowns. “Like T-Rex and Steggy?” he asks curiously.</p><p>Yugo’s laughter now is genuine, remembering Takumi’s favorite dinosaur plushies. “Exactly like that. Just because they’re different doesn’t mean they can’t care about each other. But sometimes … it’s a little hard for them.”</p><p>Eyes wide with childlike wisdom, Takumi ventures. “Maybe … if they talk and play more, they’d be okay?”</p><p>Grinning, Yugo pulls him into a hug. “You’re too smart, my little star. Thanks for cheering Daddy up.”</p><p>Takumi gives a big yawn, his eyes starting to droop closed once more. He nuzzles against Yugo’s chest. “Who do you love, Daddy?” he murmurs sleepily. “Is she nice like Mommy was?”</p><p>Yugo stiffens slightly. Clearly there is much more he needs to explain to Takumi before revealing the complex truth of his relationship with Jesse. “He’s … different from Mommy,” he says carefully. “But I care about them both very much.”</p><p>Takumi seems content with that, his eyes drooping as he cuddles closer to Yugo. “Okay, Daddy. As long as you’re happy.”</p><p>Yugo sits there holding his son in the dim light, realizing that sometimes the most profound and unexpected comfort comes from the innocent wisdom of a child. The sadness in his heart hasn’t disappeared, but sharing this quiet moment with Takumi has lessened the ache, even if just for now.</p><p>As Takumi's breathing becomes slow and even with sleep, Yugo allows a small smile to touch his lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo holds Takumi’s hand as they walk home from school on the cool autumn afternoon. The leaves have started changing colors, covering the sidewalk in hues of red, orange, and yellow. Takumi chatters away about his day, his high-pitched voice filled with innocence and excitement.</p><p>“And then at lunch break, me and Tsubasa found a huge leaf, it was like this big!” Takumi spreads his arms wide.</p><p>Yugo smiles down at his son. “That sounds like quite the leaf. Maybe you can bring it home.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Takumi nods enthusiastically.</p><p>Though Jesse has been on leave, Takumi seems unfazed. To him, his teacher is simply sick and will return soon. Yugo wishes he could protect his son’s innocence surrounding the situation for a little while longer.</p><p>They arrive home and Takumi runs inside to put down his backpack. Yugo follows slowly, his mind heavy. He hasn’t seen or spoken to Jesse all week, and it’s been harder than he anticipated. His heart aches for Jesse’s warm smile and reassuring presence. And with the school board decision looming on Saturday, anxiety pools in Yugo’s stomach.</p><p>As Yugo slips off his shoes, his phone buzzes. It’s a text from Juri.</p><p>
<em>Let’s go out to dinner tonight. My treat!</em>
</p><p>Yugo hesitates. While he appreciates Juri’s attempt to cheer him up, he’s not sure he's up for a social outing right now.</p><p>But before he can reply, another text comes through.</p><p>
<em>Don’t try to say no! I already got us a reservation at that family restaurant Takumi likes. See you there at 6:30.</em>
</p><p>Yugo chuckles under his breath. His best friend knows him well. Maybe a night out is just what he needs to get out of his own head.</p><p>He and Takumi change into something more comfortable before they make their way to the family restaurant. He immediately spots Juri from across the dining area. As they approach the table, Yugo notices Daigo sitting next to Juri.</p><p>“Uncle Daigo!” Takumi runs over to give him a hug.</p><p>“Hey, kiddo!” Daigo laughs, picking Takumi up and spinning him around. He locks eyes with Yugo over Takumi’s shoulder and grins.</p><p>Yugo smiles, warmth blooming in his chest. He should have known Juri would recruit Daigo for this cheering up mission.</p><p>After they order, Takumi recounts the story of the giant leaf to his captive uncle and godfather. Daigo gasps and ooohs at all the right moments, while Juri asks thoughtful follow-up questions. Watching his son chatter brightly between two of the people he loves most, Yugo feels his anxiety begin to uncoil.</p><p>Once their food arrives, Takumi spots a few classmates on the other side of the restaurant. “Daddy, can I play with my friends?”</p><p>Yugo nods, smiling. “Of course.”</p><p>Once Takumi dashes off, Yugo’s playful demeanor falters. Juri and Daigo share a knowing glance.</p><p>“So, how have you been holding up?” Juri asks gently, sipping on his drink.</p><p>Yugo sighs, pushing his food around his plate. “It’s been hard, not gonna lie. I know it was the right call to lay low until the decision but … not seeing or talking to Jesse at all has been tough.”</p><p>Juri nods sympathetically. “I can only imagine. Just remember, you’ve got me, Daigo, and plenty of other people in your corner.”</p><p>“I know,” Yugo says. “I’m lucky to have you guys. But …” He pauses, emotions swelling in his chest. “I miss him, Juri. I know it’s only been a week, but it feels like forever.”</p><p>“Hey, I get it,” Juri says gently. “With these complicated circumstances, it isn’t easy.”</p><p>Yugo looks down, a bittersweet smile on his lips. “I really think he might be the one, you know? We’ve even talked a little about … the future.”</p><p>Daigo raises his eyebrows. “Oh yeah? Like future future?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Yugo says softly. “I just really want him in Takumi’s life, and mine. But we have to get through Saturday first.”</p><p>“You will,” Juri assures. “No matter what happens with the school board, the most important thing is that you and Jesse talk through it. Don’t let guilt eat away at you or doubts stop you from sharing how you really feel.”</p><p>Yugo considers his friend’s words. As anxious as he is for Saturday, he knows Juri is right. “Yeah, you’re totally right. I need to stay positive and be open with Jesse about all of this, guilt and all. It’s just … scary not knowing how this will impact our relationship moving forward.”</p><p>Daigo reaches across the table and squeezes Yugo’s shoulder. “You’ve got this. And Juri and I are always here for you, no matter what.”</p><p>“Thanks, guys.” Yugo smiles, resolve strengthening. “Really, thank you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p>Juri winks. “Probably mope around feeling sorry for yourself.”</p><p>“I know it’s been rough, but hang in there,” Daigo says. “I’ve got a good feeling about you and Jesse.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Yugo smiles softly.</p><p>“Totally,” Daigo affirms. “I haven’t seen you light up like this since …” He trails off, but Yugo knows he means since Haruka.</p><p>Emotion wells up in Yugo’s throat. He never imagined feeling this way again after losing his wife. But being with Jesse has brought back meaning and light to his life.</p><p>Their conversation is interrupted when Takumi returns to the table.</p><p>“Did you have fun?” Yugo asks.</p><p>“Yeah!” Takumi says through a mouthful of fries. “Hikaru said we’ll go leaf-hunting again tomorrow!”</p><p>Yugo pulls Takumi into a hug, holding his son close. “That’s great, Takumi. Really great.”</p><p>The four of them finish their meal amid easy conversation and laughter. By the time they step outside into the cool night air, Yugo feels recharged.</p><p>He’s ready to face Saturday and whatever comes next with Jesse.</p>

<p>Jesse scrolls through the photos on his phone, each one triggering a flood of memories. He smiles faintly at a photo of Yugo attempting to cook pancakes, laughing as he flips misshapen blob into the air. Another shows Yugo and Takumi at the park, their heads thrown back in delight as they fly a kite together.</p><p>Jesse’s heart aches as he thinks about everything that’s happened in the last few weeks. The laughter and joy he shared with Yugo and Takumi seem like a distant dream now.</p><p>A new photo pops up, stopping Jesse mid-scroll. It’s a picture Daigo sneakily took at Takumi’s birthday party—Yugo and Takumi smiling at the camera, with Jesse peeking over their shoulders, hands resting lightly on their backs. They look so happy, so normal. Like a father, son, and teacher without a care in the world.</p><p>With a sigh, Jesse sets his phone down on the coffee table. He leans back into the plush white couch of Taiga’s apartment and stares up at the modern light fixture hanging from the ceiling. Taiga had graciously offered up his place after he met with the principal, while Taiga stays with Hokuto for the week.</p><p>Jesse isn’t sure what will happen after the school board makes their decision tomorrow. Regardless of the outcome, he knows he’ll have to find a new job. As soon as he was placed on temporary leave, he’d decided that quitting was the only option—it would erase any doubt about favoritism towards Takumi.</p><p>And truthfully, Jesse wants—<em>needs</em>—to be with Yugo without hiding. Even if it means starting over somewhere new.</p><p>The sound of the doorbell pulls Jesse from his thoughts. He glances through the peephole to see Taiga and Hokuto waiting patiently on the other side. Jesse takes a deep breath and opens the door.</p><p>“Hey,” Taiga says with an uncertain smile. He holds up a bottle of wine. “We come bearing gifts.”</p><p>Jesse steps aside to let them in. “You guys didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“Please, it’s the least we could do,” Hokuto says briskly. He toes off his shoes and walks further into the apartment.</p><p>Taiga shoots Jesse an apologetic look as he follows Hokuto. “We just wanted to check on you. See how you’re holding up. Tomorrow’s the big day.”</p><p>The three of them settle onto the couch, Jesse in the middle with Taiga and Hokuto on either side. Taiga busies himself opening the wine while Hokuto sits ramrod straight, surveying the apartment.</p><p>Jesse rubs his palms on his jeans. He hasn’t seen his colleagues—his friends—in weeks. Not since summer vacation and not since everything blew up. He isn’t sure what to say to them now.</p><p>Luckily, Taiga breaks the awkward silence first. “Here,” he says gently, pressing a glass of wine into Jesse's hand.</p><p>Jesse murmurs his thanks. He takes a small sip, savoring the dry oaky flavor.</p><p>Taiga leans back with his own glass and crosses his long legs. “So …” he begins slowly. “How are you doing? And don't just say ‘fine.’”</p><p>Jesse huffs out a humorless laugh. Trust Taiga to see right through him.</p><p>“Honestly? I’ve been better,” he admits. He stares into his wine glass, watching the dark liquid swirl. “Some days it feels like everything is falling apart. Like no matter what I do, someone gets hurt.”</p><p>Taiga nods in understanding. “I can’t imagine how difficult this is for you. This isn’t exactly an ideal situation.”</p><p>“That’s putting it mildly,” Hokuto mutters.</p><p>Taiga shoots him a look before continuing. “But it doesn’t change how I”—she shoots Hokuto a glance—“<em>we</em> see you, Jesse. You’re still the same caring, dedicated person I’ve known since college.” He places a supportive hand on Jesse’s shoulder. “Who you love doesn’t define you. Your actions do. And you’ve always treated your students with the utmost care and respect, regardless of their parents.”</p><p>Jesse blinks back the lump rising in his throat. “Thank you,” he whispers. “You have no idea how much I needed to hear that.”</p><p>Taiga smiles gently. “What you and Kochi-san have … it may not look traditional, but love is love. I know you’re trying to navigate impossible waters here, but don’t lose sight of what’s important. The connections you’ve made. That's real.”</p><p>Jesse nods, bolstered by Taiga’s steadfast support. He glances over at Hokuto, who’s been uncharacteristically quiet.</p><p>Hokuto presses his lips together. “I won’t pretend I approve of the position you’ve put yourself in,” he says frankly. “But that doesn't mean I’ve written you off as a lost cause.” He turns to face Jesse head-on. “I know you, Jesse. You’ve always tried to do right by your students. But there are reasons relationships between teachers and parents are discouraged. Did you consider how this could impact Takumi if things don't work out?”</p><p>Jesse’s shoulder slump. “Of course. I never meant for it to get this far …”</p><p>“Intentions only get you so far,” Hokuto says wisely. “Going forward, you need to think rationally about what’s best for everyone involved. Not just yourself.” His stern expression softens slightly. “I’m not saying you need to change who you are. But balance head and heart. For your sake, and Takumi’s.”</p><p>Jesse absorbs Hokuto’s advice. As usual, he’s managed to cut right to the heart of the issue — Jesse needs to proceed with care to avoid hurting those caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>“You’re right,” Jesse says. “I’ve been thinking this whole week on how to make this work for all of us.”</p><p>“Don’t forget, you’re not in this alone.” Taiga squeezes his shoulder supportively. “We’ve got your back.”</p><p>Jesse smiles, gratitude welling up inside him. Tomorrow is still full of uncertainty, but one thing’s for sure is that he’ll face it head-on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse taps his foot nervously on the worn carpet outside the principal’s office. The faint smell of stale coffee and the photocopier toner hangs in the air. He glances at Yugo sitting next to him, who meets his gaze with a small, reassuring smile.</p><p>“It’ll be okay,” Yugo whispers. “No matter what happens, we’ll figure it out together.”</p><p>Jesse nods, comforted by Yugo’s calm confidence. As always, Yugo is his rock in even the most turbulent of storms.</p><p>“I know,” Jesse replies. “I just can’t stand this waiting. I wish we could get it over with.”</p><p>He understands the school’s position. As Takumi’s teacher, parents will assume that Jesse will abuse his role, especially since he and Yugo have kept their blossoming relationship a secret. But nothing could be further from the truth. Jesse would never dream of jeopardizing his career or Takumi’s education. He cares too deeply for both.</p><p>“I keep running our last time at the park in head,” Jesse admits, eager to think of something other than the investigation. “Remember how Takumi tried to explain the big bang to us using popcorn and soda?”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “Yes, and how he was utterly convinced that popcorn was the perfect representation for exploding stars.”</p><p>Jesse grins. “Well, in his defense, they both pop and burst into existence from seemingly nothing.”</p><p>The two share a moment of laughter, a temporary escape from the gravity of the situation.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking, Yugo,” Jesse begins, his tone suddenly serious. “I’m quitting this school and find a job elsewhere. Regardless of whether I get to keep my job or not. Somewhere we don’t have to hide.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes widen in surprise. “Jesse, we haven’t even—”</p><p>“I just … I don’t want to hide our relationship anymore,” Jesse interjects. “A new school would give us a fresh start. A chance to date openly.”</p><p>Yugo pauses, processing Jesse’s words. Taking a deep breath, he nods slowly, squeezing Jesse’s hand reassuringly. “Let’s discuss it properly after this meeting, okay?”</p><p>Before Jesse can reply, the door to the principal’s office opens, revealing the secretary. She gives them a sympathetic smile and gestures for them to enter.</p><p>The atmosphere inside the office is stifling. Mr. Yoshida sits behind a formidable wooden desk, his expression a perfectly practiced neutral. Jesse and Yugo take their seats, instinctively reaching for each other’s hands for support. The silence in the room feels like a pressure cooker.</p><p>After what seems like hours, Mr. Yoshida finally speaks. “After a thorough investigation and discussions with the board, it’s been determined that they found no evidence of misconduct on your part, Jesse.”</p><p>Jesse’s heart races, his grip on Yugo’s hand tightening.</p><p>“By all accounts, you’ve been an exemplary teacher. No complaints from parents or students,” Mr. Yoshida continues. “However, you should have disclosed your relationship with Kochi-san immediately to avoid any semblance of impropriety. I trust you understand that.”</p><p>Jesse nods emphatically. “Yes, sensei, you’re completely right. I should have been more transparent from the start. I sincerely apologize for the position I put you and the school in.”</p><p>Mr. Yoshida clasps his hands on the desk. “Given the circumstances, you’re allowed to resume your duties here. <em>But</em>,” he adds with emphasis, “exercise utmost discretion. If a situation like this arises again, the consequences will be severe.”</p><p>The weight on Jesse’s chest lifts slightly, replaced by a mix of relief and uncertainty. He glances at Yugo, whose eyes shine with unshed tears.</p><p>“Thank you, Yoshida-sensei,” Jesse manages to say, his voice shaky.</p><p>The principal nods, ending the conversation.</p><p>As he steps out of the office, the relief washes over him like a cleansing rain. Yugo leaps up, pulling Jesse into a fierce embrace.</p><p>“Everything’s gonna be okay,” Jesse whispers into Yugo’s shoulder.</p><p>Yugo pulls back, eyes shining. He glances around quickly before placing a soft kiss on Jesse’s lips.</p><p>Jesse treasures the fleeting contact. As the principal has made clear, they will have to be discreet from now on. But it is a small price to pay to continue teaching and seeing Yugo and Takumi.</p><p>“We should celebrate tonight,” Jesse says, keeping his voice low. “Come over to my place? I’ll cook dinner.”</p><p>“I can’t wait,” Yugo replies with a smile. “I’ll ask Daigo or Juri if they can babysit.”</p><p>They walk out of the school hand in hand, the autumn sun warm on their faces. For the first time in weeks, Jesse feels like he can breathe again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse looks around his classroom, taking in the bright construction paper flowers and hand-drawn pictures decorating the walls. It’s the last day of school—and Jesse’s last day at work—and the bittersweet feeling of endings and new beginnings hangs in the air.</p><p>“I can’t believe it’s the end of the year already,” Jesse muses, leaning against his desk. “You all have learned so much and made me so proud.”</p><p>The students look back at him with wide admiring eyes. Jesse has been their teacher all year. He knows each of their personalities, learning styles, and family backgrounds. His genuine care for each student is evident in the way he patiently answers their questions, celebrates their accomplishments, and comforts them when they struggle.</p><p>Takumi raises his hand eagerly. “Jesse-sensei, will we see you again next year?”</p><p>Jesse smiles. He plans to sit Yugo and Takumi down soon to discuss their shared future. “Well, Takumi, I’ll be at a different school. But we’ll definitely see each other again, I promise.”</p><p>Takumi accepts this with a nod, his innate curiosity satisfied for now. The class continues, Jesse leading them through end-of-year activities and reflections. As the final bell rings, the students line up to give Jesse hugs before leaving the classroom.</p><p>Takumi lingers, holding out a card. “This is for you, sensei,” he says. “I worked really hard on it.”</p><p>Jesse opens the card and sees a crayon drawing of himself holding hands with Takumi and his classmates. The words “We Love You Jesse-sensei” are written in Takumi’s tentative handwriting. Jesse's eyes well up with tears and he gives Takumi an extra-long hug.</p><p>“Thank you, Takumi. I love it—I’ll treasure this forever.”</p><p>Transitioning to the faculty room feels like stepping from one world into another. The room is suffused with the aroma of fresh coffee and a touch of nostalgia. On the table, yearbooks and farewell gifts are scattered. The clock ticks in the background, marking the impending end.</p><p>Just then, the door swings open and Taiga strides in. His confident posture contrasts with the somber expression on his face.</p><p>“Jesse …” Taiga says simply, then steps forward to embrace him.</p><p>Jesse sinks into the hug, remembering both the joy and heartbreak of their past romance. Things had been shaky since they reunited, but Jesse’s happy he still gets to keep Taiga in his life, even as friends.</p><p>Taiga pulls back, the corners of his lips turned upwards. “You better not ghost me when I message you.”</p><p>“I’d never. Who else would I message about the latest dramas?”</p><p>From the room's corner, Hokuto clears his throat, breaking their banter. With a sheepish expression, he steps forward. “Jesse, I know I’ve been a stickler for rules … maybe too much.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize, Hokuto.” Jesse’s expression softens. “I appreciate you keeping me in line. What you said to us at the fireworks festival was the reality check we needed.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, a new understanding passing between them.</p><p>Jesse looks over at Taiga then nudges Hokuto. “You better keep an eye on this one.”</p><p>Hokuto’s hand finds Taiga’s, their fingers intertwining. “I will. His happiness means everything to me.”</p><p>Jesse continues packing up the last of his belongings, his shoulders heavy with a sense of closure. He takes one final look around the faculty room that has been his second home for years. Colleagues, mentors, friends—this room holds memories of them all.</p><p>As he walks out the door and towards his future, Jesse feels a swell of emotions. He’ll miss this place and these people dearly. But ahead of him waits a conversation with Yugo about their dreams for a life together, with Takumi included.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse nervously paces the living room, his footsteps echoing his heartbeat’s rhythm. His apartment, usually a sanctuary of peace, now seems to amplify his anxiety. He stops every few seconds, checking his reflection in the windows. He ruffles his hair, straightens his shirt and tries to calm his racing thoughts.</p><p>“Why do you look like you’re about to ask Yugo to marry you?” Shintaro smirks, leaning against the door frame, arms crossed. His playful tone doesn’t quite mask the concern in his eyes.</p><p>“Can you not, Shin? I’m about to have a heart-to-heart with Takumi,” Jesse replies, eyes narrowed in frustration.</p><p>Shintaro rolls his eyes, his smile broadening. “You know, if I didn’t know you better, I’d think you were the kid here.”</p><p>Jesse glares at him, unimpressed. “Takumi’s approval means everything to me,” he says, his voice softening. “I don’t want him to see me as the evil stepdad trying to steal his dad away from him.”</p><p>Shintaro approaches his friend, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “Jesse, you’re one of the most caring and considerate people I know. Just be honest with Takumi about your feelings, and he’ll see you for who you really are.”</p><p>With newfound determination, Jesse nods and sets off to Yugo’s apartment. The walk feels like an eternity, and Jesse’s mind races as he arrives building. Taking a deep breath, he presses the doorbell, his heart pounding.</p><p>Yugo answers, a nervous smile plastered on his face. He looks just as anxious as Jesse, and they share a moment of understanding. “He’s in the living room,” Yugo whispers, stepping aside to let Jesse in.</p><p>Takumi’s eyes light up as he spots Jesse. “Jesse-sensei!” He races over to hug him. “Are you coming back to school?” he asks, eyes shining with hope.</p><p>Jesse kneels to be at eye level with the boy, his voice gentle. “That’s not why I’m here, Takumi. Can we sit down and talk?”</p><p>Takumi looks puzzled but nods, taking a seat on the couch. Yugo joins him, and Jesse sits beside Yugo, their hands finding each other’s.</p><p>Yugo clears his throat, his voice a little shaky. “Takumi, I have something to tell you. You know how Jesse-sensei was your teacher before, right?”</p><p>Takumi nods again.</p><p>“Well, we met before he started teaching you, and we liked each other a lot.” He looks at Jesse, his eyes searching for support.</p><p>Jesse squeezes Yugo’s hand reassuringly.</p><p>Yugo continues. “We wanted to stay away from each other because we didn’t want anyone to think that Jesse liked you more because he was dating your dad. But the truth is, we love each other, and Jesse wants to be your other dad.”</p><p>Takumi’s eyes bounce between Yugo and Jesse, probably trying to understand the situation.</p><p>Jesse takes over, his voice sincere and warm. “I really love your daddy, Takumi, and I want to spend more time with you and him. Maybe forever. I don’t want to replace your mommy, but I’ll do my best to make you both happy, if you want me to.”</p><p>Silence fills the room, a tension that seems to stretch on forever. Yugo gently nudges Takumi, his voice a soft whisper. “You don't have to decide right now, okay?”</p><p>Takumi looks thoughtful, his eyes serious for a seven-year-old. Finally, he breaks the silence, his voice innocent but heartfelt.</p><p>“You make my daddy smile a lot, like when he looks at my drawings. If you can make him that happy, then I want you here.”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes well up with tears, his voice choked as he hugs Takumi tightly. “Thank you, Takumi,” he whispers, a smile spreading across his face.</p><p>Yugo’s eyes shimmer with unshed tears, a smile etching itself onto his face, a hopeful look in his eyes as he gazes at Jesse and Takumi, two of the most important people in his life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A year had zipped by since Jesse had first bared his heart to Takumi, and now Jesse and Yugo were not only officially dating but doing a pretty good job of it too. In the blink of an eye, Takumi had gone from shyly peeking at Jesse from behind his dad to dragging him by the hand to show off his latest dinosaur drawings to calling him “Jesse-kun” instead of “Jesse-sensei.” The trio had made it a habit to spend their weekends together, exploring parks, museums, and even the odd planetarium visit – all thanks to Takumi’s space obsession.</p><p>Jesse had become a staple at Yugo and Takumi's apartment, and not just on weekends. He had found himself over at their place more and more often, his toothbrush now had a permanent home in their bathroom, and he’d even stashed a few shirts in Yugo's closet. It was hard to say who had more of Jesse’s heart, Yugo or Takumi.</p><p>Jesse wakes up to the smell of pancakes wafting through the air. He stretches and glances over at the clock, surprised to find it’s already 8 a.m. He hears the sizzling of bacon and smiles, realizing Yugo is in the kitchen. Jesse pulls on a shirt and pads into the kitchen, where he sees Yugo flipping pancakes expertly.</p><p>“Morning,” Jesse murmurs, wrapping his arms around Yugo’s waist from behind.</p><p>Yugo turns his head, his smile lighting up the room. “Morning, love.”</p><p>They share a quick kiss, and Jesse feels a warmth in his chest that has nothing to do with the hot stove.</p><p>The patter of little feet echoes down the hallway, and Takumi appears at the kitchen entrance, his hair sticking up in all directions. He rubs his eyes, looking around the room.</p><p>“Morning, buddy!” Jesse calls out, reaching over to ruffle Takumi’s hair. Takumi grumbles but allows the gesture.</p><p>Takumi climbs onto a barstool at the kitchen counter, peering at the stack of pancakes. “Jesse-kun, you're here a lot,” he says, his voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>Jesse chuckles, looking over at Yugo, who is suppressing a smile. “Yeah, I like hanging out with you and your dad.”</p><p>Takumi considers this, spooning a generous helping of syrup onto his pancakes. “If you're here all the time, why don’t you just live here?”</p><p>Yugo and Jesse exchange a glance, both caught off guard. Jesse can see the love and uncertainty in Yugo’s eyes. He squeezes Yugo’s hand reassuringly.</p><p>Yugo clears his throat, looking down at Takumi, who is busy cutting up his pancakes. “Well, buddy, that’s something Jesse and I need to talk about.”   </p><p>Jesse reaches over and affectionately ruffles Takumi’s sleep-mussed hair again. “You make a good point though. I have been here a lot more lately. So if your Daddy and I decide I should move in, how would you feel about that?”</p><p>Takumi considers the question, eyes thoughtful. He glances between the two men, then gives a small shrug. “I guess that would be okay,” he decides through a mouthful of pancakes.</p><p>Yugo and Jesse exchange an amused smile.</p><p>“We’ll keep thinking about it,” Yugo promises. He takes a sip of coffee, meeting Jesse’s gaze over the rim of the mug. The look conveys wordlessly that the two of them will be revisiting this topic soon.</p><p>As they sit around the breakfast table, Jesse can't help but feel a sense of completeness. They chat and laugh, and the room is filled with a warm and loving atmosphere. Jesse looks forward to the future, a future where he, Yugo, and Takumi can build a life together. He is grateful for the family he has found in Yugo and Takumi and can’t wait to see what the future holds for them.</p><p>In that moment, as the sun streams through the windows, casting a golden glow over everything, Jesse feels an overwhelming sense of contentment. He looks at Yugo, who is watching him with a smile on his face, and he knows he has found his home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The autumn breeze whispers through the trees as Jesse arrives at his and Yugo’s new apartment complex. He pauses to take in the sight of the plain brown building they now call home. It’s not much, but it’s theirs.</p><p>Jesse climbs the stairs to their apartment, smiling as he unlocks the door. The smell of roasted vegetables and grilled meat wafts through the air—trust Daigo to arrive early and start prepping the food.</p><p>“Honey,  I’m home,” Jesse announces jokingly as he steps inside.</p><p>Yugo looks up from setting the table, his stern face breaking into a grin. “Hey,” he says, pulling Jesse into a quick kiss. “Cutting it a little close, aren’t you?”</p><p>Jesse glances at his watch. “I know, sorry. Parent-teacher conferences ran late.”</p><p>“Well, you’re here now,” Yugo says. “Everyone else is in the living room. I’ll get Takumi to help you carry up the rest of the plates.”</p><p>Jesse nods and heads into the living room where their family and friends are chatting amiably.</p><p>“Jesse!” Juri calls out, waving a beer in greeting. “Fashionably late as always.”</p><p>Jesse laughs. “Good to see you too, Juri.” He exchanges greetings with Aya, Daigo, Hokuto, and Taiga.</p><p>“Uncle Jesse!” Sakiko barrels into him, nearly knocking the wind out of his lungs. Jesse catches the enthusiastic eight-year-old, spinning her around playfully.</p><p>“Hey kiddo,” he says, setting her down gently. “Where’s your favorite cousin?”</p><p>“Takumi!” Sakiko yells at the top of her lungs. “Uncle Jesse is here!”</p><p>Within seconds, Takumi comes racing into the room and crashes into Jesse's waiting arms.</p><p>“You made it!” the boy exclaims. At eight years old, he’s all elbows and knees, but Jesse doesn’t mind.</p><p>“Of course, I did,” Jesse says, ruffling Takumi’s hair. “Did you help your dad set up?”</p><p>Takumi nods eagerly. “Yeah! And Uncle Daigo let me stir the sauce. Wanna see?”</p><p>“Maybe after we get the rest of the stuff from the storage room,” Jesse suggests. He’s constantly amazed by Takumi’s limitless enthusiasm.</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Takumi allows Jesse to steer him toward the door to help with the remaining party supplies.</p><p>Soon the food is spread out and everyone is seated around the too-small dining table making plates. Laughter and banter fill the cramped space as they pass dishes back and forth. Jesse meets Yugo’s eyes next to him, seeing his own joy reflected there.</p><p>After shoveling down his food with typical seven-year-old gusto, Takumi tugs insistently on Jesse’s sleeve. “I made something for you and Daddy,” he whispers loudly. “Wanna see?”</p><p>“Of course, bud.”</p><p>Beaming, Takumi retrieves a sheet of construction paper from the other room. It’s one of his colorful drawings, depicting stick figures of Jesse, Yugo, and Takumi holding hands, surrounded by the rest of their family.</p><p>Jesse’s eyes sting with sudden tears. He pulls Takumi into a one-armed hug. “It’s perfect. Thank you.” Over Takumi’s head, he meets Yugo’s tender gaze.</p><p>The drawing makes the rounds, eliciting a chorus of “awws” from their family. Soon discussion turns toward the future, with Aya suggesting they consider giving Takumi a sibling.</p><p>Jesse laughs along good-naturedly, but feels Yugo stiffen slightly next to him. They haven’t breached the topic of expanding their family again just yet. For now, he gives Yugo’s knee a reassuring squeeze under the table, content with the way things are.</p><p>After dinner, Juri taps his glass and stands up to speak. “I just wanted to say congrats to Yugo and Jesse on this new chapter.” He grins wryly. “Never thought I’d see the day when my best friend became a domesticated family man.”</p><p>Everyone chuckles. Yugo shakes his head, but can’t keep the smile off his face.</p><p>“You two have been through a lot to get here,” Juri continues sincerely. “But I think I speak for everyone when I say we’re happy you found your way together. To Yugo and Jesse!”</p><p>“To Yugo and Jesse!” the guests chorus, raising their glasses high.</p><p>Jesse is grateful no one can see him discreetly wiping a tear from his eye. He never imagined they’d receive so much support, but here they all are—friends, family, even his ex-boyfriend—celebrating their love without judgment. It’s more than he could’ve dreamed of.</p><p>Slowly the guests begin to trickle out, exchanging heartfelt hugs and well-wishes with Yugo and Jesse as they leave. Before long, only Takumi remains, passed out on the couch between his fathers after a day filled with fun and excitement.</p><p>Jesse runs a gentle hand through the boy’s hair, heart bursting with love for this family they’ve created.</p><p>“Thank you,” he says softly, meeting Yugo’s eyes. “For everything.”</p><p>Yugo leans in and kisses him tenderly. “Thank you,” he echoes. “For not giving up on me … on us.”</p><p>They sit in contented silence for a while, Takumi's deep breathing the only sound. There will be new challenges ahead, but right now, Jesse thinks, everything is exactly as it should be.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
