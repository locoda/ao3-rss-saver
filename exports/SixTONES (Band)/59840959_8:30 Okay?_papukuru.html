<h2 class="toc-heading">8:30 Okay?</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was so quiet Taiga could swear he could hear the imaginary crickets chirping in the closed indoor room.</p><p>Five minutes had already passed and neither of them had said a single thing.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>How did it turn out like this?...</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>One moment he was studying his script and suddenly he was thrown into a room with an unbearable atmosphere.</p><p>If the silence went on for much longer, Taiga was sure he was going to be suffocated by it.</p><p>“Uh–” “Um—”</p><p>Their mouths that they had opened to speak immediately shut the moment their voices clashed.</p><p>No, Taiga took it back, his hands growing clammy and cold.</p><p>If he didn't figure something out soon, this room would be his grave.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Kiss scenes weren't supposed to be difficult, were they? All it was, was just a kiss. The touching of two pairs of lips at a slight angle. The bumping of mouths. The gesture of affection and love. That was it. A kiss. That's all it was.</p><p>But for some reason, Taiga was cursed by something beyond the human veil that made it difficult.</p><p>“Kyomoto? You closed your eyes just a little too quickly… Everything was fine, but could you do it one more time?”</p><p>“Ah. Uh. Yeah. Sorry.”</p><p>One more time, the director said.</p><p>This was already the fifth time…</p><p>More than feeling guilty for messing up something so simple, Taiga felt bad for making his co-star kiss him more than necessary. When he bowed and apologized after finally getting a good take, she smiled and told him it was okay and that it was just work. Taiga understood that it was all part of the job, but he knew that kissing the person who was essentially her coworker couldn't have been pleasant.</p><p>It was like he was stumbling at the start line. His acting career was just picking up and for some reason he struggled with something so basic. He was praised mostly for everything else, but the scenes that would be the topic of articles and the subject of social media posts by fans had to be the thing he fought with the most.</p><p>The original incident had already happened months ago, but it refused to stop haunting him as he read over his script in the backseat of his manager’s car.</p><p>In his new drama, there was already a kiss scene in episode three.</p><p>The trauma from filming his movie hardly had the chance to wear off before having to do another one again.</p><p>Apparently, his sigh had been louder than he thought when he saw his manager peek at him through the rear view window before bringing his attention back to the road.</p><p>“Is there something wrong?”</p><p>Though at first reluctant, Taiga opened up. This manager worked with him often with his filmings and was present to see the mess he had caused earlier this year.</p><p>“There's a kiss in tomorrow's script…”</p><p>“Already?”</p><p>Taiga was happy to know his thoughts weren't only of his own.</p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p>“Did you get the chance to practice like you wanted?”</p><p>“No… not really.”</p><p>He had already forgotten about the loose promise he gave his last director after apologizing for keeping everyone late. He said he would practice, followed by a smile and a shared laugh, but “practicing” a kiss wasn't exactly easy when he didn't have a partner.</p><p>It wasn't like he was about to ask any of his old female co-stars for help. That just sounded like a surefire way to either get complaints for sexual harassment or a scandal to be sent to gossip magazines.</p><p>And he didn't exactly have a romantic partner.</p><p>If he did, his performance probably wouldn't have been so terrible in the first place.</p><p>The car went quiet for a moment, neither of them speaking as the turn signal began to click as they stopped at a red streetlight.</p><p>They were almost at the office building. The group was scheduled to meet today though they were a bit early due to Taiga’s morning filming schedule.</p><p>The silence went on as the car turned, leaning Taiga into the side door before they straightened out with the spinning of the wheel.</p><p>“I think I might know someone who can help you.”</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“There's someone in the office today who has a lot of acting experience. I think he should have some time available before the shoot starts. Should I see if—”</p><p>“Yes!! Uh, yes please!”</p><p>In hindsight, Taiga realized he shouldn't have been so gung-ho without asking who the name of the person was first, but at that very moment, all Taiga could see was a way out.</p><p>Finally, there was an answer to his problems. There was a light at the end of the tunnel that he could escape to at last. And even if it doesn't work out, he could at least walk away from the experience knowing he had tried.</p><p>Something was better than nothing as he excitedly looked down at his script again, not listening to the conversation his manager had on the phone.</p><p>Anything was better than nothing.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>But just not this.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Matsumura Hokuto, his own member, his group mate, one of the five people he shared the name SixTONES with, was an excellent actor.</p><p>At his age, he had already a wide range of acting experience under his belt and had no signs of stopping.</p><p>Taiga knew this. He even praised and openly admired this about Hokuto.</p><p>But when his manager mentioned someone with lots of acting experience, he didn't think he meant Hokuto.</p><p>… Why?</p><p>Well, in Hokuto’s own words, they didn't exactly “<em>get along</em>”.</p><p>Their notorious relationship was infamously rocky. The pair affectionately called <em> kyomohoku </em> had gone through its fair share of ups and downs and very very steep downs. Admittedly, things had healed significantly since their debut (called the melting of their ice age) and had been rather steady ever since, the fact that it was steady was precisely why Taiga wasn't exactly keen on rocking the boat.</p><p>It was steady now and he wanted to make sure it stayed steady.</p><p>But being pushed through the green room door by his manager before he left with only a swift thank you and sorry for the sudden request wasn't exactly what Taiga called “not rocking the boat”.</p><p>Taiga would have preferred discussing the topic of “kissing” with the scariest of seniors before facing his own group's Matsumura Hokuto. But here they were. Standing in the uncomfortable silence that was almost synonymous with their names paired together.</p><p>The silence that was left with them was increasingly unbearable and proportionally, the awkwardness that came from it became worse and worse.</p><p>As much as Taiga wished there was, there wasn't really an escape route here.</p><p>Of course, he could just run out the door. He <em> could</em>, but he wouldn't.</p><p>After all, Hokuto was a precious member of his group as the others were as well. They had a unique relationship many other people would never know or ever have. He couldn't run out the door.</p><p>Not without saying anything, anyways.</p><p>“Ah– so… Uh. You were the one the manager asked?...” Taiga finally said, not without looking at his own script as an excuse not to meet Hokuto’s eyes.</p><p>Hokuto couldn't have known he was the one their manager was speaking about, right? Realistically speaking, Hokuto probably didn't want to do this either.</p><p>With the right words, Taiga could create a scapegoat for both of them and let them part with no hard feelings. Japanese culture was all about the power of suggestion and subtleties. If he was able to pick the right words, he could find a way out of this hellish situation.</p><p>“Um… Yeah,” Hokuto replied.</p><p>“Is… is that a problem?”</p><p>Taiga wanted to wack his forehead with his palm.</p><p>Damnit, Hokuto.</p><p>Please read where I'm trying to go with this, he thought to himself.</p><p>“No no, not at all–” Taiga said, waving his hand. “I know you have a lot of experience. I know you're good at it too. It's just–”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Taiga mentally cringed.</p><p>Yes, Taiga watched his dramas. Even the romantic ones. He had seen every kiss scene Hokuto had in his repertoire but he'd rather die than admit that.</p><p>Just saying he watched Red Eyes in front of their group mates was enough to make both of them completely turn red. And frankly, Hokuto didn't need to know those details.</p><p>“Uh… Yeah. Sometimes, when I have time…”</p><p>“Oh. Well, thank you.”</p><p>The awkward feeling Taiga had tried so hard to dispel slowly came seeping back in as they both felt quiet again.</p><p>People have called him the weird one but then why was Hokuto so horrible at reading the room??</p><p>He was trying to do them both a favor by moving past this but Hokuto was tripping him at every step he took.</p><p>It was like sabotage, though usually in sabotage, the other party benefited from it. Right now, it really just felt like Hokuto was shooting himself in the foot.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I… don't mind giving you tips…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga blinked, right as he was trying to force himself to find something to talk about.</p><p>When he turned to him, Hokuto wasn't looking at him, which was what he expected, but immediately he could tell Hokuto was trying as hard as he was.</p><p>All the key motions Taiga had learned over the years that signaled Hokuto’s anxiety were coming to the forefront.</p><p>The fidgeting in his chair. The biting of his lip.</p><p>His odd habit of touching his nose whenever he became nervous.</p><p>Despite his first impressions, Hokuto really was putting in his best efforts.</p><p>While Taiga was trying to run away, Hokuto was trying to find a way to help him.</p><p>Taiga’s shoulders relaxed as Hokuto rambled, filling in for the absence of Taiga's immediate response.</p><p>“Only if you want them, of course. When our manager was talking about it on the phone, it sounded like you were at an impasse so I figured I could try to help…</p><p>“– Not that I assume I know better than you,” Hokuto corrected, “but you know…”</p><p>“As your fellow member…”</p><p>As was mentioned before, he and Hokuto didn't really “<em>get along</em>”.</p><p>But a lot had changed since then.</p><p>Since their debut, Hokuto had really become more of himself than he had ever been in the last twelve years. Had this been six years ago, Taiga wondered if Hokuto would have even saved him if he was drowning.</p><p>What kind of person would he be, turning down help his member so cautiously offered?</p><p>Taiga wasn't that cold-hearted.</p><p>Not to mention he really did need the help too.</p><p>His hands tightened on his script.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks…”</p><p>“I'll take anything you have to offer.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga sat down on the couch across from Hokuto and explained his problems. The stiff feelings, the unnatural flow, the unfortunate timing of closing his eyes. Hokuto listened patiently, nodding his head as he kept his eyes down on the empty table between them, taking in what were essentially his woes.</p><p>“So basically, it doesn't feel natural?”</p><p>Taiga sighed, sinking in his seat. “Something like that…”</p><p>“But you've done one for a drama before, haven't you?”</p><p>“ — Or that's what I've heard, at least…”</p><p>“Ah. Uh… yeah.”</p><p>Despite the abruptly added caveat Hokuto added to his question, he was right.</p><p>Before <em> Ienai Himitsu</em>, Taiga had done one kiss scene for <em> Tsukunoma no Ichika </em> where it finished with them sharing a vulnerable and tender moment as the cold waves washed over them on the shore. From what Taiga could tell, it was well received but during filming, he still had difficulties with the odd angle before finally capturing one that worked.</p><p>“But, it didn't really teach me a lot, obviously…” he followed.</p><p>“Do you maybe get nervous?”</p><p>Taiga thought for a moment, his head tilting as he pondered.</p><p>Nervous wasn't really the right word for it. It wasn't like his hands shook or his heart began to race every time the film started rolling. It was something else.</p><p>“It's more like… I'm not sure what I'm doing.”</p><p>The pages of the script flipped in Hokuto’s hand and he hummed quietly.</p><p>“I think I understand.”</p><p>“Sometimes it's hard to make it feel natural rather than forced.”</p><p>After the cover of the script shut, Taiga looked over to find Hokuto taking out his own.</p><p>“Yes… Exactly…”</p><p>The edge was already decorated with evenly spaced tabs, unlike the rough dog ears of his own. Even the pages were already filled to the brim with clean highlights and neat notes that pass with streaks of color as the pages flipped by.</p><p>It was easy to forget about the other sides of someone when you're with them so often.</p><p>Taiga so often saw the relaxed and playful person Hokuto became when surrounded by the peaceful atmosphere of their group that he had forgotten the side of Hokuto he rarely ever saw.</p><p>Hokuto truly loved acting. It was obvious simply from the way the cover already had creases and the stiff paper had relaxed from repeated use. It was a passion he had ever since they shared a screen for that drama all those years ago.</p><p>Even though Taiga was the one busy with roles all year, as Jesse once said, Hokuto was the one with the heart of an actor.</p><p>Taiga could only aspire to love this profession so dearly.</p><p>“The same thing happens to me too sometimes,” Hokuto said, his eyes scanning the words on the page. “When I'm caught up in my head or focus too hard on the details, it starts to get stiff and robotic.”</p><p>“When that happens, I try to focus back on who I need to be and what I should feel.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Taiga believed he more or less knew, but for the purpose of making Hokuto elaborate, he asked.</p><p>He watched as Hokuto’s brow pinched, his mind trying to find the right words as he flipped the page.</p><p>“Acting is less about putting on a show than it is to portray the heart of your character, right?” Hokuto asked rhetorically, but Taiga still hesitantly nodded. “Acting is easier done when you can understand their mind and their feelings as if they were your own.”</p><p>“Kiss scenes may be uncomfortable to you because in that moment, you're too busy in your own mind being yourself than your character who's living in that crafted world.”</p><p>“When you're kissing someone you want to kiss, you don't think about all the small details…”</p><p>“... Right?”</p><p>As Hokuto finished his sentence, he raised his head and their eyes, intentionally or unintentionally, met.</p><p>Immediately, Taiga’s stomach twisted as both he and Hokuto quickly distracted themselves with something else, Taiga with checking the time on his phone and Hokuto with fixing a crease in his script.</p><p>“Uh… Yeah. Right…”</p><p>This was why he didn't want to talk to Hokuto about this kind of thing.</p><p>They had gotten clos<em>er</em>, but not nearly close enough that they were openly discussing topics like this.</p><p>Already, the group was rather adverse to talk about their own private relationships and out of all of them, Hokuto was absolutely the last person Taiga would have chosen.</p><p>There was no doubt Hokuto felt the same as he quickly moved on, holding his hand out to Taiga, surprising him.</p><p>“W-what–? What do you want–?” Taiga stammered as he jumped a little, making Hokuto quickly withdraw his motion.</p><p>“Sorry– umm…” Hokuto paused, his words getting scrambled in his mind as he waved his hands. “Your script! I meant to ask for your script. Can I see it?”</p><p>With everything going on, Taiga had completely forgotten about it peeking out from the top of his bag.</p><p>He tried to wash away the heat building in his face as he scrambled for it, pulling the straps of his bag off his shoulders to swiftly retrieve it before depositing it in Hokuto’s hands.</p><p>“Uh- mind if I read?...”</p><p>“N-no, not at all. By my guest.”</p><p>As Hokuto laid it out before them on the coffee table, Taiga helped guide him to the part he believed Hokuto was looking for.</p><p><em> Omukae Shibuya-kun </em> had only begun filming a few weeks ago. The main criticism for his scenes had taken place during <em> Ienai Himitsu </em>, but once seeing the all too familiar kiss scenes return again, he couldn't help but feel anxious. The first kiss happened so early. Most series would wait until the last few episodes for the climax of the growing romance between characters. Yet, somehow, the first fully shown kiss was already happening in episode three.</p><p>The kiss was under the pouring rain after Shibuya is found wandering the streets alone. After a sweet moment, he kisses his sister's kindergarten teacher he's had a crush on under a small umbrella.</p><p>By nature, scripts never gave much direction for the kiss itself and this was no exception. The action was written in simple quick words, leaving the details to be crafted by the setting and the spoken lines. Though admittedly, the loose rules made Taiga worry more. He liked to follow his script like a rule book, but the fewer rules there were, the less direction he had.</p><p>He sighed softly to himself as he watched Hokuto turn the pages of his script.</p><p>It was a little embarrassing how his notes weren't nearly to the same level as Hokuto’s, but it wasn't like his were messy or unorganized, they just weren't as neurotic as the man in front of him.</p><p>Maybe if he tried as hard as Hokuto, he wouldn't be in this situation, asking for advice from his member.</p><p>But as Taiga watched Hokuto quietly skim through the pages, he knew he couldn't afford the time to sulk over it.</p><p>Maybe the only real solution was just to work a little harder…</p><p>“... There's not that many lines, are there?”</p><p>The silence and Taiga’s musings were broken when Hokuto spoke, the room suddenly coming back to life after a temporary stagnation.</p><p>Taiga nodded, agreeing with him as he leaned in to peer over at the page Hokuto had open.</p><p>“Ah… Yeah.”</p><p>His character didn't speak much, though he felt a lot.</p><p>His emotions spoke stronger through his body than his face or his voice. It gave the drama a comedic edge that made it fun, but also made the execution just that more difficult.</p><p>“... You know, sometimes when I'm having a hard time, I just… forget myself for a moment.”</p><p>When Taiga looked up, Hokuto’s eyes were still down on the script, following the lines.</p><p>His hand creased the paper as his fingers pressed into its curve.</p><p>“He's quite emotional, isn't he?”</p><p>The “<em>he</em>” Hokuto refers to is Shibuya Taikai, the role Taiga plays.</p><p>“His actions are funny but it's only because he feels a lot. Aota is his first love and his feelings are going wild,” Hokuto goes on.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Sensei, do you not like younger men</em>?”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga’s eyes widened.</p><p>For a moment, he forgot to breathe.</p><p>From just one simple line, Hokuto seemed to transform.</p><p>Maybe it wasn't the perfect Shibuya Taikai, but it was someone else. His eyes, his speech and the pressure of his fingers on the page weren't his own, but the ones taken from the words in the script.</p><p>He wore the feelings of another person like it was easy as breathing. Taiga understood what it was like to stand on a stage and have his muse and the music take over, controlling his own body and his voice to show the audience before him, them and not himself, but Hokuto managed to do it with a whole other delicacy.</p><p>The cadence of his voice, his composure, his expression. It was as if he was no longer the person he had known for ten years. Even the way his lips moved and his fingers pressed into the page carried his longing.</p><p><em> His </em> longing.</p><p>Matsumura Hokuto was absolutely incredible.</p><p>There was still so much for Taiga to learn.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... Can you show me?”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... Huh?”</p><p>As their eyes met, Taiga shared the confusion that Hokuto had in his eyes because he wasn't even really sure he knew what he was asking for.</p><p>All he knew was that there was something Hokuto was in touch with that he didn't yet have and he wanted to learn.</p><p>How he lost himself in the character.</p><p>How for a moment, he was less himself but <em> them </em> instead.</p><p>“Uh… Show you what?”</p><p>Taiga needed a moment to think about it himself before finding an answer.</p><p>“Show me how you do it.”</p><p>“D-do what?...”</p><p>“That.”</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘that’?...”</p><p>Hokuto was so painfully difficult sometimes.</p><p>Taiga grabbed his script and nearly shoved it in his face.</p><p>“<em>This</em>. The kiss scene. The wearing of the role. All of that.”</p><p>“Huh??” Hokuto reeled back. “How am I supposed to do that??”</p><p>Taiga dropped and planted his script into the table with his hands and a sigh. “I don't know, Hokuto. Just like… just do the scene again so I can watch.”</p><p>“How?? It's a two-person scene!”</p><p>“Then I'll be your partner!”</p><p>That was the obvious solution, wasn't it?</p><p>It was a two-person scene and there were two of them in the room. The answer was literally as easy as one plus one, one role for them each.</p><p>But as Hokuto covered his face with an exasperated sigh, Taiga soon realized he had forgotten an important part of the equation.</p><p>This was a kiss scene.</p><p>At the end, the two characters kissed.</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Right.</p><p>He had fucked up.</p><p>This wasn't something he should have asked his own member, Matsumura Hokuto, whom he had a strange relationship with, to do with him.</p><p>He really shouldn't be asking any of his members to kiss him, and Hokuto was an especially delicate subject, but Taiga wasn't about to back down now.</p><p>If anything, it'd only make him look weird and pathetic to take it all back at this point. He had to charge forward and in the end, there was still something he hoped to learn.</p><p>He just wanted to see it up close one more time.</p><p>“Ah– uhh well– just leave out the kiss… we can do everything up until then, right?” Taiga quickly said.</p><p>Nice damage control, though the recovery was only marginal. There was still and odd air between them, but this was better than silence.</p><p>“I just want to see you do it. Not necessarily so I can copy you but— I just want to know…”</p><p>Hokuto’s lips flattened as he opened the script again, easily finding the page that had been crisply dog-eared.</p><p>This scene was particularly difficult as Shibuya didn't have many lines himself. The world was more or less happening around him before he felt the whim to lean in and kiss Aota, but that only made Taiga more curious.</p><p>He wanted to know how Hokuto would wear it. He wanted to see how Hokuto would feel it.</p><p>Taiga watched as Hokuto let out a quiet sigh before ruffling the back of his hair and itching at his neck while wearing a slightly twisted expression. It didn't take a genius to tell that he didn't really want to do this, but with another deep breath, he relented.</p><p>“... We stop before the kiss, right?”</p><p>Taiga nodded.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Right before the kiss.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga went to get a drink to give time for Hokuto to read over the script again. He expected to sit in silence for a while longer, but by the time he opened the door, Hokuto already seemed ready.</p><p>It was a short scene after all, but Taiga thought he would have more time to prepare himself. Since he only knew Shibuya’s lines, he would be using the script to read Aota’s straight from the page, but still, there was something he needed to steel within himself before he sat on the same couch and read them face to face with Hokuto.</p><p>But the clock was ticking. Their next job was starting soon.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Ready?...”</p><p>“... Ready.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The scene was set in the middle of the night, covered in heavy rain.</p><p>The green room, obviously, was not.</p><p>As Hokuto said, it was hard to become immersed without the set of the stage, but with the desire to make things work, Taiga shut off the ceiling lights and left only the narrow standing lamp as if it were to be the street light over their heads. Still, there was no rain and there was no umbrella for them to share under the shower, but without risking property damage or superstitious bad luck, the best they could do was use their imagination as Taiga held up an invisible handle to guard them from the invisible rain.</p><p>Taiga set the script in his folded lap and nodded as Hokuto told him he'd begin a little further back from where their scene started to set the pace.</p><p>“Give me about five seconds, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>They faced each other in the dimly lit room.</p><p>And as Hokuto took in a deep breath, Taiga instinctually followed as the room went silent.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Five.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Four.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Three.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Two.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>One.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Sensei</em>.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was Taiga’s character and along with direction, Taiga had made him his own. It was only natural that Hokuto's Shibuya would be different after only reading sections of the script a couple times, yet for what they were doing and from what he knew, it was perfect.</p><p>His voice was low and flat as the difficult Shibuya was meant to be, but it undoubtedly carried something different.</p><p>A yearning. An ache of a confused boy in love.</p><p>Taiga moved his ‘umbrella’ forward as he glanced down at his line, reading straight from the page.</p><p>“<em>Shibuya-san? What are you doing here? You're soaking wet!</em>”</p><p>His delivery was more stiff. As to be expected. He was playing a woman's role that he was delivering for the first time, and while he was vaguely familiar with the lines, he didn't know them perfectly.</p><p>But in the end, it wasn't his performance that mattered.</p><p> </p><p>It was Hokuto’s.</p><p>And Taiga consumed every detail he could.</p><p>Truly, even the smallest things made a huge difference. Just the way Hokuto swallowed before he spoke or let out his remaining breath in a soft sigh that followed made him completely and utterly someone else.</p><p>To put it simply, Hokuto was amazing. Incredible, even.</p><p>It made Taiga not want to lose with such a half-assed delivery.</p><p>And when he held out the invisible umbrella, Hokuto lowered his head as if the clear vinyl was truly there.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... <em> Sensei </em>…”</p><p>“<em>Do you not… like younger men?...</em>”</p><p>“<em> … N-No I never said anything like that–...</em>”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto was younger than him too, wasn't he?</p><p>Sometimes Taiga forgot.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<em>I'm so relieved…</em>”</p><p>“<em>You're all wet…</em>”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga didn't know at what point it started.</p><p>But as the scene went on, he thought he could hear the rain.</p><p>As they traded their lines, he could hear the gentle pattering over the street and their small shelter, he could feel the droplets he brushed from Hokuto’s stained shoulders, wetting his palms.</p><p>He thought he could see the rain that fell from Hokuto’s dark hair as his eyes watched him with an unrelenting gaze. One they would never share between them as Taiga and Hokuto, but as Aota and Shibuya.</p><p>The thunder was just as real as he flinched, pulling down his umbrella that drew them closer, tangling the boning in Hokuto’s hair.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“<em>I'm so sorry! Are you okay??</em>”</p><p>“<em>... Ah. Yes…</em>”</p><p>“<em>Wait, sorry. Your hair got stuck. Stay still for a second…</em>”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga reached out to rescue the strand that wasn't stuck in the metal limbs that weren't there, but in that moment, they were. In that moment, the bindings refused to let go as he fought with it, his brow furrowing before leaning closer.</p><p>He didn't notice the breath that nearly reached his lips until his hand was suddenly pulled away and he met the eyes that made his body and his heart stop all at once.</p><p>The rain was pouring around them as Hokuto’s grip tightened around his wrist.</p><p>Hokuto’s gaze was so heavy, Taiga couldn't bring himself to breathe.</p><p>So much was held in his eyes.</p><p>A need.</p><p>A want.</p><p>A love he couldn't control as he began to lean in.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was truly amazing.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>A kiss would never be natural if he put too much thought into it. Taiga learned that now. A kiss couldn't be directed because when people kissed, their first thought was never to think of when they closed their eyes, how far to turn their head or what shape to make their lips.</p><p>It was simply the desire and love that moved couples forward and lowered their eyes.</p><p>It was that painful yearning. That wanting. That silent burning affection of the person he was meant to play.</p><p>It wasn't his own.</p><p>It was <em> theirs</em>.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… They were supposed to stop, weren't they?</p><p>By the time Hokuto’s lips met his, Taiga had completely forgotten.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>How long had he been in love with Hokuto?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>At this point, it was too many days to remember.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Somewhere along the way, Taiga decided to wear a mask of his own. It was really the only thing he could do to hide that those first few years of their freeze didn't hurt him and that Hokuto’s sudden cold disposition after being so warm didn't hurt.</p><p>He had been stuck in this act since then, playing the role of someone who had never hoped things had been just a little different. A character who hadn't wished he had tried just a little harder to keep Hokuto close.</p><p>Even now, Taiga was still supposed to be acting.</p><p>He was supposed to be Aota Aika, the teacher who was the token of Shibuya Taikai’s strong affections.</p><p>But, right now.</p><p>More than anything.</p><p>More than anytime.</p><p>More than anyone.</p><p>He was himself.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Right now, he was Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He was the Kyomoto Taiga that still battled with his own feelings.</p><p>The Kyomoto Taiga that wished on his worst days that he could forget.</p><p>The Kyomoto Taiga that was still in love with Matsumura Hokuto many years later.</p><p>The Kyomoto Taiga that could feel the heat of Hokuto’s soft lips.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>After they kiss, Aota Aika pushes Shibuya Taikai away in her shock.</p><p>The umbrella held in her hand is discarded before she runs away, leaving them both in the rain and Shibuya sits alone under the street light to stew in his mistakes.</p><p>… But that was Aota Aika.</p><p>In the dimly lit green room of their company building, Kyomoto Taiga let go of the empty space in his hand to softly take Matsumura Hokuto’s cheek.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And before either of them could open their eyes, Kyomoto Taiga kissed Matsumura Hokuto again.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>There wasn't a moment’s hesitation as their lips met once more.</p><p>Taiga didn't think. His body simply moved as each kiss that followed was his desire and his love. He didn't ponder the angle of his head or the pacing of his breath as he let their lips meet in a careful and sweet synchronicity. He didn't worry about the view of the nonexistent camera as Hokuto adjusted their kiss to catch his lips more fully.</p><p>His mind was full of nothing but Hokuto as the room crafted for privacy held only them and the gentle sounds made between their breaths were emboldened by its silence.</p><p>As their lips melted together, the grip Hokuto had on his wrist loosened only enough to travel up to take his hand. He drew it to his chest as their noses bumped, Taiga’s fingers slowly unfurling to lay flat against him.</p><p>With Hokuto’s breath hot against his skin, under his palm, Taiga could feel the soft heartbeat that pounded against it.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Who were they anymore?...</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga knew he had already strayed far from his role, but who was Hokuto?</p><p>He didn't know who the person was before him.</p><p>Was the pleading in his eyes and his shaking of his breath Shibuya’s or was it his?</p><p>Was the gentle catching of his lip for Aota or was it for him?</p><p>Taiga couldn't tell anymore.</p><p>But for the moment, he was willing to forget as long as he could wind his fingers in the ends of Hokuto’s hair.</p><p>As Hokuto leaned in, Taiga let himself slowly fall, the other following closely until his back met the flat of the narrow couch.</p><p>Taiga could feel Hokuto’s shoulders flinch when his script tumbled from his lap to fall heavily to the floor, but he quickly soothed the shock from his body as he looped his arms around Hokuto’s neck, drawing him back into him.</p><p>Who knew how much time had passed. Taiga didn't know as seconds felt like minutes between each rock of their lips and each break for a breath felt like hours, but when Hokuto finally pulled away, it felt like the world stopped as he gazed down at him. Their eyes locked in ways they hadn't since they were young as the single lamp shed light only on his back.</p><p>Taiga could still feel his heart pounding against his palm (a <em> kyuun </em> maybe) as Hokuto’s lips began to form words.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What would he say?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Whose name would he say?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Sensei? Or–</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“...... —”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Before Taiga could find out, a brisk knock on the room door sent them jolting apart.</p><p>The both of them were already scrambling to pull themselves together before the voice of their own member called through it.</p><p>“Kyomo~! Hokuto~! Are you guys done?? We're about to start filming soon!”</p><p>Hokuto nearly jumped to his feet while Taiga rolled over, grabbing his script from the floor to tuck under his arm as he watched Hokuto rush for the door.</p><p>Hokuto was scrubbing his lips with the back of his hand before he undid the latch.</p><p>Taiga could only guess it was to rid himself of the sensation as he opened the door to greet Juri before saying something typical and slipping past him with his bag.</p><p>Juri peeked inside, catching Taiga’s eye as he rose from the couch, wiping his own lips against his sleeve.</p><p>“I heard from the manager that you guys were having some kind of lesson?”</p><p>“... Something like that,” Taiga said flatly as he grabbed his bag.</p><p>“I was shocked, you were in there for a while. Did you learn anything useful?” Juri held the door open, letting Taiga through to see his other members along with Hokuto already settling in for their shoot.</p><p>“Debatable…”</p><p>“But it wasn't a waste of time?”</p><p>“No, not a waste of time… I wouldn't call it that.”</p><p>“Then what was it?”</p><p>Taiga kneaded his slightly swollen lip between his teeth before shoving his script back into his bag.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Confusing.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><hr/><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“So how did it go?”</p><p>“Mnnn… Alright?… It’s hard to say…”</p><p>Hokuto only heard bits and pieces of the conversation between Juri and Taiga as he stood up, muttering quietly to Yugo that he'd be studying in a private room.</p><p>He slung his bag onto his shoulder with his script under his arm, only getting a glance of Taiga’s pensive face before he walked away, their voices growing distant.</p><p>“The director said it was better… More realistic maybe, but it still took a couple takes.”</p><p>“Out of all things, I thought kissing would be easy…”</p><p>“Sure, coming from the person who hasn't had a kissing scene in years—...”</p><p>It has already been just over a month since he and Taiga… kissed… or something like that.</p><p>Their lips certainly touched and breaths were definitely traded, but Hokuto couldn't really say he understood exactly what had happened. Everything after Taiga began reading his lines was all a blur.</p><p>It wasn't the first time he had been blinded by his role before. There had been times before where his character’s emotions wore him so well that everything just came naturally. The heat of the stage lights, the pressure of the watching camera and the detailed set put him exactly where he needed to be as he became completely immersed in his role.</p><p>But this had been in a green room.</p><p>All they had were dim lights and an imaginary umbrella in Taiga’s hand.</p><p>All he could remember was the shape of Taiga’s lips and the glistening in his eyes he rarely ever got to see.</p><p>Hokuto let out a sigh after shutting the door behind him, enclosing him into the small private room and throwing his bag down onto the couch with a soft thump.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>How long had he been in love with Taiga?</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It had been so long, he lost track.</p><p>After disconnecting himself from him, he acted cold to Taiga for years, fighting the desire to do anything but be sweet to him.</p><p>For the most part, it went well. Hokuto could only believe his successful acting career was an attestment to how well he had been able to pull it off for so long. He had been pretending for years that they just “<em> didn't have a connection </em> ” and “ <em> didn't get along </em>” despite how close they had been before.</p><p>Though, recently, the cold front had started to melt.</p><p>The atmosphere between them had become less frigid as they comfortably traded simple conversations alone and found their tastes matched more often than they originally imagined. It made work easier and less stressful to simply get along, but as much as Hokuto enjoyed laughing at his jokes and seeing his pleased smile, it only made it more difficult to keep up his act.</p><p>It was becoming more difficult to pretend he didn't care, that he hadn't been in love with him since they first met all those years ago. It was becoming harder to not smile when their eyes just happened to catch or when their shoulders accidentally bumped.</p><p>He felt like Sisyphus with his boulder. He was forever cursed with pushing the heavy stone up the steep slope, trying to reach the top of the mountain called <em> getting over Kyomoto Taiga</em>. On most days, he was able to hold on. Even when his arms ached and his body was sore, he could push past the feelings he locked inside himself and carry on rolling his boulder.</p><p>But the moment their lips met, his foot slipped. The boulder had become too much as it took him down with it, tumbling and blundering all the way back to the foot of the mountain where all he could do was stare at the peak in the distance as he had to face his feelings all over again.</p><p>He reprimanded himself for days after, but this wasn't the first time he and his boulder fell to the bottom, and Hokuto knew this wouldn't be his last.</p><p>Like the cursed man himself, Hokuto would have to push it all the way back up the mountain over and over again only to never reach the top.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>As he went to take a seat, the door clicked and swung open so abruptly he almost fell back.</p><p>Thankfully, he was able to catch himself against the wall as he quickly spun around while the door shut again, but only for him to be thrown off kilter as he suddenly found he was no longer alone in the room.</p><p>His heart nearly jumped from his throat.</p><p>“W-woah!! You surprised me— Can't you come in with some more grace??”</p><p>Hokuto clasped his hand over his chest as Taiga only laughed in apology.</p><p>Typical of the spoiled member of their group.</p><p>“Hey, um… Do you have a minute?...”</p><p>Hokuto frowned a little as he went to his bag. Not that long ago, Taiga would make a face that told him he would rather die than stay in a room alone with him, but he didn't see a glimpse of anyone leading Taiga through the door.</p><p>If he came here by himself, then what was he here for?</p><p>His heart was beginning to race as he tried to act as normal as he possibly could.</p><p>“I was about to go over my script, but I have a minute, yeah,” Hokuto said, finding his pen case amongst his things, ignoring the way his hands grew clammy.</p><p>Every second that Taiga delayed his response, the stress in Hokuto’s muscles doubled.</p><p>Any longer and Hokuto would have crushed the thin pen in his hands.</p><p>“Well–...”</p><p>Over the last three weeks, neither of them mentioned what happened — not that Hokuto was surprised though — He knew that <em> he </em>wouldn't be saying anything and he had heavy doubts that Taiga would either.</p><p>Did that mean that Hokuto didn't think about it though?</p><p>No. Of course, not.</p><p>Rather, he thought about the confrontation so often that it kept him up at night as he stared at the dark ceiling of his bedroom.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “It was disgusting.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You're disgusting.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I regret what happened.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Why would you kiss me?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You took advantage of me.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Let's forget this ever happened.” </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Naturally, only the worst to the worst of the worst came to his mind, because why wouldn't they?</p><p>From the very moment their lips parted, Hokuto expected Taiga to be revolted both by him and the feelings he fought so hard to hide. He had been saved by the knock on the door and the work that immediately preceded it, but every day that passed just added to the sinking anticipation for what may or may never happen.</p><p>But it was happening now, wasn't it?</p><p>He would finally be receiving the harsh words that he surely deserved for taking advantage of him in that moment.</p><p>It was fine. It had to happen eventually. Maybe things would become cold between them again, but there really was no other choice. Maybe this would be good for him. Maybe this time he could finally take the time to get over Taiga.</p><p>Maybe he could—</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Uh… Hokuto?...”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto almost gasped, his mind snapping back to the present after Taiga waved his hand between his empty eyes and the bag he had been blankly staring into.</p><p>If Taiga had been talking, he hadn't heard a single thing he said.</p><p>“Um… Huh?...”</p><p>Taiga sounded anxious as he sighed, pushing his lengthening hair behind his ear.</p><p>“Can you just say yes or no, already?...”</p><p>As much as Hokuto wanted to give Taiga the answer he wanted, he had no idea what he was saying yes or no to, but Taiga was growing impatient.</p><p>It probably would have been better to just ask Taiga to repeat himself, but Hokuto’s problem solving skills weren't the best when under pressure.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Uh… Yeah. S-sure.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jeez.</p><p>Really. How could Hokuto not be in love with him?</p><p>He didn't know what he had said yes to, but whatever it was made Taiga turn red from ear to ear.</p><p>The way he covered his mouth with the back of his hand was so cute.</p><p>“Okay… Then I'll contact you later.”</p><p>“O-oh… Okay–”</p><p>In an instant, Taiga was gone as quickly as he arrived, and the moment the door closed behind him, all the stress weighing on Hokuto’s body fell from his shoulder as he fell into the stiff couch.</p><p>Well, that didn't go as he imagined, though he wasn't really sure he could say what even happened, but it was better than the alternatives.</p><p>Whatever it was made Taiga happy —or something like that— and that was enough for Hokuto to be satisfied without exactly knowing why.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Though, he would forever regret not paying attention when he got the first message ever from Kyomoto Taiga on his phone.</p><p>
