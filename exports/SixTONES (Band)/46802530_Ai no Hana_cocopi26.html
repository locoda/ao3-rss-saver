    <div class="userstuff">
      <p> </p><p>"<em> Oniichan..</em>."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> wake up!"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse tried to open his heavy eyes as someone shook his body, calling his name, waking him up in this early midnight summer. He tried to reach his clock on his desk but he couldn't find it as someone held his hands.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Charlotte?"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em>!"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Happy birthday!!" Charlotte said cheerfully with her bright smile as though Jesse, his brother, could see it. Jesse had woken up forcibly after Charlotte grabbed his wrist. His lap was full of a cake, which he still couldn't recognize, with candles saying 26 on it. He heard Charlotte take a deep breath before she started singing. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday dear Oniichan… </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you… </em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Her voice sounded so soft yet cheerful. Jesse clapped his hands with Charlotte when she finished her singing. Jesse had opened his eyes wide as he saw the beautiful candle had lit. He crossed his fingers and made a wish before he blew it. A soft smile etched on his lips as Charlotte circled her arms around his broad shoulders. She turned ON the lamp and Jesse could see everything clearly. It was a small round white chocolate baked cake with flower-shaped colorful whipped cream around it. There was a handwritten Happy Birthday and three cherries in the corner. It was simple yet beautiful and quite satisfying to his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you bake it?" </p><p>Charlotte nodded as she smiled softly. Knowing how hard she tried caused warmth inside his heart. Jesse knew Charlotte never baked a cake before. She can cook, indeed, but just simple cooking. Their grandma was the one who cooked for them everyday.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis, the first child in their family and Charlotte Lewis, her sister, used to live with their grandparents. Their parents had passed away 7 years ago because of an airplane accident. They were on a business trip to LA and wanted to come back to Japan to celebrate Jesse's birthday.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>But fate said otherwise.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>It was so tough for them, especially Charlotte because she was still 9 years old at that time. Of course it was so <em> damn </em>difficult for Jesse too. He had been blaming himself for years because he thought everything happened because of him.</p><p> </p><p>Because they wanted to celebrate his birthday. </p><p> </p><p>If he didn't ask them, they might still be here with him.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>His grandma had come to pick them up and asked them to live together in their house in Osaka. They didn't have any reason to say no. It was too painful for Jesse if he kept living only with Charlotte in their house in Tokyo. Jesse, who was still fifteen, had to study harder because he had to take care of his father's company. His grandpa had been taking the role as the chairman and he needed Jesse to help him. So Jesse learned a lot from him. He went to college and graduated with a master degree in Business and Management. He had planned to go for a PhD but his grandpa asked him to be the CEO of Lewis Company. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Jesse, you've studied hard these years. It's time for you to become your father's successor. Come and join me." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That's why he postponed his PhD programs and joined his grandpa in their company. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Charlotte, on the other hand, had been taken care of by her grandmother. She had been in a private school. She had been planning to go to a Science and Technology University. </p><p>Jesse had been living alone in Tokyo since he turned 22, to make it easier for him because it's closer to Lewis Company. He felt lonely, of course. He has no one but Charlotte and his grandparents. So Jesse tried another way to wash his loneliness. </p><p> </p><p>He was in a relationship.</p><p> </p><p>He had been in a relationship before, but she dumped him. </p><p> </p><p>She said that he was too busy. </p><p>She didn't love him anymore.</p><p> </p><p>A classic reason for someone who already knew who she dated.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Jesse really did his best to give his time for her. He had spent his weekend with her, letting her plan anything that she wanted for them. Somehow they went on dates, watched movies, or just spent their time in Jesse's house. Jesse really loved her and he felt delighted to be with her. She was a sweet girl with a sweet voice and a radiant smile. She was full of kindness and caring. She has long black hair that reached her back and Jesse used to play it while they were cuddling or when she leaned on Jesse's chest while watching a movie. He had a joyful time with her.</p><p> </p><p>Especially on his birthday.  </p><p> </p><p>Somehow Jesse celebrated it alone. Somehow with his family in Osaka. They had celebrated in the usual way, but Jesse couldn't hide his sadness. </p><p> </p><p>He had celebrated his birthday once with his girlfriend. His ex-girlfriend. It was just two of them but the atmosphere was warm. He felt delighted to celebrate it with her, especially since his birthday was the saddest day for him because it was the same day as the death anniversary for his parents. Her existence gave him a new color in his life. It didn't mean that he didn't feel thankful to his family, but it was just more like he could share his pain with her and tried to cover the hole in his heart. </p><p>It was so painful for him when she asked him to break up. He asked her the reasons, but when she said that he was too busy and it made her not love him anymore, he gave up. It was cruel, indeed. But maybe she wasn't for him.</p><p>So he moved on. It had been two years since the last time he celebrated his birthday with her. Since last year, Charlotte had been coming to his home to celebrate his birthday because he couldn't leave his work here.</p><p> </p><p>Last year, Charlotte had prepared a small birthday party for him. She had come with their grandparents. Some of his childhood friends had also come. Jesse had a lot of fun and felt so grateful for their love.</p><p>Tonight, Charlotte had come alone in this midnight early summer. Honestly, he wasn't sure whether she had come alone or with their grandparents again. So he tried to look for them in his entire house and he found no one but Charlotte and him. He went back to sleep last night on his own bed and Charlotte in the other room. He had been living alone but he still had two bedrooms in his house. Just in case, if he had a visitor beside his family. </p><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>Jesse blinked his eyes slowly as he tried to open his eyes. He woke up after smelling something delicious coming from the kitchen. He checked his clock on his desk. It was 9 in the morning. He walked through the door and saw Charlotte had finished preparing their meals.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! You woke up. Good morning!"</p><p> </p><p>"Please have a seat." Charlotte said with her cheerful tone. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, I need to wash my face first." </p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked towards his bathroom. He took his toothbrush that hung under the mirror. As he washed his teeth, Charlotte called him. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want tea or coffee?"</p><p>"Teaaa!!" Jesse said with his loud voice. As he finished washing his face, he walked to the kitchen and took a seat on their dining table. </p><p> </p><p>"You know I've learned a lot, so don't worry. It tastes good." Charlotte said with confidence. Jesse let out a chuckle and did what she ordered. To be honest, it was a common breakfast for him. She prepared steamed rice, a bowl of miso soup, a grilled fish as the main dish, <em> tamagoyaki </em> , and a small plate of pickled vegetables. Jesse slurped the miso soup and it tasted so good. His eyes were closed and he couldn't stop humming to show how yummy the miso soup was. Then he took a bite of the grilled fish and his eyes widened as he chewed the fish. The texture was soft and it blended well with the miso soup. He took a piece of <em> tamagoyaki </em> in one bite and took his steamed rice in a big bite. He was eating it peacefully. He didn't even realize that Charlotte hadn't taken any bite because she was busy watching him. </p><p>"... Does it taste so good or are you just hungry?" Charlotte asked jokingly.</p><p>"..... Both, I guess." Jesse said and he laughed freely.</p><p>"Are you going back today?"</p><p>"Yup. Grandma said she wanted to go to onsen and I will come with her."</p><p>"I see… Anyway, please tell her I might come at the end of this year."</p><p>"Okaaaay~~"</p><p> </p><p>They kept their focus back to their food, finishing it and cleaning the table. Jesse helped with the dishes as he let his sister take a shower first. </p><p>His eyes caught something on his table. A pot of a plant. He had been wondering since when he bought a plant. He never did it before, or he did?</p><p>"Oh! I forgot to tell you. That was my gift for you." Charlotte said in front of her room when she finished changing her clothes.</p><p> </p><p>"A plant?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> said you're lonely, right? So I bought you a plant. I can adopt a dog or a cat for you though but you're busy. Pet needs the owner to play with them. So I bought a plant. It is easier to feed and you can talk with them too."</p><p>Jesse eyebrows furrowed as his lips pursed. He felt thankful to Charlotte for her gift. But he had never grown a plant before. He couldn't help but worry about what if the plant wilted because he forgot it?</p><p>"Just put it around your windows, make sure it gets sunlight and water every morning. It's easy, <em> Oniichan </em>." Charlotte said as she read his mind. Jesse gave a nod and grinned as he said thank you to her.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked his sister to the front door and bid her goodbye. He closed the door and went back to the kitchen to take his plant. He put them in his living area, close to his window, then he watered it.</p><p> </p><p>"Eat well, grow well..." Jesse said before he walked to the bathroom and got ready to go to work.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>
