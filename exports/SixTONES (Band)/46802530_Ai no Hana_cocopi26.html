<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>"<em> Oniichan..</em>."</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> wake up!"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse tried to open his heavy eyes as someone shook his body, calling his name, waking him up in this early midnight summer. He tried to reach his clock on his desk but he couldn't find it as someone held his hands.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Charlotte?"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em>!"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Happy birthday!!" Charlotte said cheerfully with her bright smile as though Jesse, his brother, could see it. Jesse had woken up forcibly after Charlotte grabbed his wrist. His lap was full of a cake, which he still couldn't recognize, with candles saying 26 on it. He heard Charlotte take a deep breath before she started singing. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday dear Oniichan… </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you… </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Her voice sounded so soft yet cheerful. Jesse clapped his hands with Charlotte when she finished her singing. Jesse had opened his eyes wide as he saw the beautiful candle had lit. He crossed his fingers and made a wish before he blew it. A soft smile etched on his lips as Charlotte circled her arms around his broad shoulders. She turned ON the lamp and Jesse could see everything clearly. It was a small round white chocolate baked cake with flower-shaped colorful whipped cream around it. There was a handwritten Happy Birthday and three cherries in the corner. It was simple yet beautiful and quite satisfying to his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you bake it?" </p><p>Charlotte nodded as she smiled softly. Knowing how hard she tried caused warmth inside his heart. Jesse knew Charlotte never baked a cake before. She can cook, indeed, but just simple cooking. Their grandma was the one who cooked for them everyday.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis, the first child in their family and Charlotte Lewis, her sister, used to live with their grandparents. Their parents had passed away 7 years ago because of an airplane accident. They were on a business trip to LA and wanted to come back to Japan to celebrate Jesse's birthday.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>But fate said otherwise.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was so tough for them, especially Charlotte because she was still 9 years old at that time. Of course it was so <em> damn </em>difficult for Jesse too. He had been blaming himself for years because he thought everything happened because of him.</p><p> </p><p>Because they wanted to celebrate his birthday. </p><p> </p><p>If he didn't ask them, they might still be here with him.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>His grandma had come to pick them up and asked them to live together in their house in Osaka. They didn't have any reason to say no. It was too painful for Jesse if he kept living only with Charlotte in their house in Tokyo. Jesse, who was still fifteen, had to study harder because he had to take care of his father's company. His grandpa had been taking the role as the chairman and he needed Jesse to help him. So Jesse learned a lot from him. He went to college and graduated with a master degree in Business and Management. He had planned to go for a PhD but his grandpa asked him to be the CEO of Lewis Company. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Jesse, you've studied hard these years. It's time for you to become your father's successor. Come and join me." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That's why he postponed his PhD programs and joined his grandpa in their company. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Charlotte, on the other hand, had been taken care of by her grandmother. She had been in a private school. She had been planning to go to a Science and Technology University. </p><p>Jesse had been living alone in Tokyo since he turned 22, to make it easier for him because it's closer to Lewis Company. He felt lonely, of course. He has no one but Charlotte and his grandparents. So Jesse tried another way to wash his loneliness. </p><p> </p><p>He was in a relationship.</p><p> </p><p>He had been in a relationship before, but she dumped him. </p><p> </p><p>She said that he was too busy. </p><p>She didn't love him anymore.</p><p> </p><p>A classic reason for someone who already knew who she dated.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Jesse really did his best to give his time for her. He had spent his weekend with her, letting her plan anything that she wanted for them. Somehow they went on dates, watched movies, or just spent their time in Jesse's house. Jesse really loved her and he felt delighted to be with her. She was a sweet girl with a sweet voice and a radiant smile. She was full of kindness and caring. She has long black hair that reached her back and Jesse used to play it while they were cuddling or when she leaned on Jesse's chest while watching a movie. He had a joyful time with her.</p><p> </p><p>Especially on his birthday.  </p><p> </p><p>Somehow Jesse celebrated it alone. Somehow with his family in Osaka. They had celebrated in the usual way, but Jesse couldn't hide his sadness. </p><p> </p><p>He had celebrated his birthday once with his girlfriend. His ex-girlfriend. It was just two of them but the atmosphere was warm. He felt delighted to celebrate it with her, especially since his birthday was the saddest day for him because it was the same day as the death anniversary for his parents. Her existence gave him a new color in his life. It didn't mean that he didn't feel thankful to his family, but it was just more like he could share his pain with her and tried to cover the hole in his heart. </p><p>It was so painful for him when she asked him to break up. He asked her the reasons, but when she said that he was too busy and it made her not love him anymore, he gave up. It was cruel, indeed. But maybe she wasn't for him.</p><p>So he moved on. It had been two years since the last time he celebrated his birthday with her. Since last year, Charlotte had been coming to his home to celebrate his birthday because he couldn't leave his work here.</p><p> </p><p>Last year, Charlotte had prepared a small birthday party for him. She had come with their grandparents. Some of his childhood friends had also come. Jesse had a lot of fun and felt so grateful for their love.</p><p>Tonight, Charlotte had come alone in this midnight early summer. Honestly, he wasn't sure whether she had come alone or with their grandparents again. So he tried to look for them in his entire house and he found no one but Charlotte and him. He went back to sleep last night on his own bed and Charlotte in the other room. He had been living alone but he still had two bedrooms in his house. Just in case, if he had a visitor beside his family. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">*****</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse blinked his eyes slowly as he tried to open his eyes. He woke up after smelling something delicious coming from the kitchen. He checked his clock on his desk. It was 9 in the morning. He walked through the door and saw Charlotte had finished preparing their meals.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! You woke up. Good morning!"</p><p> </p><p>"Please have a seat." Charlotte said with her cheerful tone. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, I need to wash my face first." </p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked towards his bathroom. He took his toothbrush that hung under the mirror. As he washed his teeth, Charlotte called him. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want tea or coffee?"</p><p>"Teaaa!!" Jesse said with his loud voice. As he finished washing his face, he walked to the kitchen and took a seat on their dining table. </p><p> </p><p>"You know I've learned a lot, so don't worry. It tastes good." Charlotte said with confidence. Jesse let out a chuckle and did what she ordered. To be honest, it was a common breakfast for him. She prepared steamed rice, a bowl of miso soup, a grilled fish as the main dish, <em> tamagoyaki </em> , and a small plate of pickled vegetables. Jesse slurped the miso soup and it tasted so good. His eyes were closed and he couldn't stop humming to show how yummy the miso soup was. Then he took a bite of the grilled fish and his eyes widened as he chewed the fish. The texture was soft and it blended well with the miso soup. He took a piece of <em> tamagoyaki </em> in one bite and took his steamed rice in a big bite. He was eating it peacefully. He didn't even realize that Charlotte hadn't taken any bite because she was busy watching him. </p><p>"... Does it taste so good or are you just hungry?" Charlotte asked jokingly.</p><p>"..... Both, I guess." Jesse said and he laughed freely.</p><p>"Are you going back today?"</p><p>"Yup. Grandma said she wanted to go to onsen and I will come with her."</p><p>"I see… Anyway, please tell her I might come at the end of this year."</p><p>"Okaaaay~~"</p><p> </p><p>They kept their focus back to their food, finishing it and cleaning the table. Jesse helped with the dishes as he let his sister take a shower first. </p><p>His eyes caught something on his table. A pot of a plant. He had been wondering since when he bought a plant. He never did it before, or he did?</p><p>"Oh! I forgot to tell you. That was my gift for you." Charlotte said in front of her room when she finished changing her clothes.</p><p> </p><p>"A plant?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> said you're lonely, right? So I bought you a plant. I can adopt a dog or a cat for you though but you're busy. Pet needs the owner to play with them. So I bought a plant. It is easier to feed and you can talk with them too."</p><p>Jesse eyebrows furrowed as his lips pursed. He felt thankful to Charlotte for her gift. But he had never grown a plant before. He couldn't help but worry about what if the plant wilted because he forgot it?</p><p>"Just put it around your windows, make sure it gets sunlight and water every morning. It's easy, <em> Oniichan </em>." Charlotte said as she read his mind. Jesse gave a nod and grinned as he said thank you to her.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked his sister to the front door and bid her goodbye. He closed the door and went back to the kitchen to take his plant. He put them in his living area, close to his window, then he watered it.</p><p> </p><p>"Eat well, grow well..." Jesse said before he walked to the bathroom and got ready to go to work.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It has been a month since Charlotte gave this plant to him.</p><p> </p><p>It has been a week since the last time he watered it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Last week was so hectic for Jesse. He had flown to LA and London to attend important meetings. He just arrived in Japan yesterday and he didn't even check his entire house or clean up the pile of dust in his house. His body and his brain needed some rest. </p><p> </p><p>He just had time today. After taking more than 10 hours of sleep, he finally woke up.</p><p> </p><p>More precisely, he forced himself to wake up.</p><p> </p><p>It was so difficult to open his heavy eyes in the morning though. His bed gravity was too strong and caused him to stumble a few times as he tried to bring his body up. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse just realized that he didn't change his suit last night. He started remembering that after loosening his tie, he dived to his bed without even taking off his socks. </p><p> </p><p>It was around 3 in the afternoon. After taking a bath, he was unpacking his luggage and sorting every sheet of his clothes. He didn't forget to buy some gifts for his beloved people.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse bought a bottle of fragrance with Orange Blossom Cologne for Charlotte because he knew that his little sister loves perfume and it would fit her perfectly if Jesse remembered how bright she is as a person. He bought hampers of The Afternoon Tea Collection for her grandma because she is a tea-lover. Meanwhile, for his grandpa, he only bought him a set of Lewis Chessmen Chess.</p><p> </p><p>No, no. He didn't buy it because there was Lewis on it. He didn't. He just simply bought it because his grandpa loves an old-stuff and he loves playing chess. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse bought all of them in London because he never wanted to be in LA too long. It is such a crucial place for him. He wished he would never visit that place again but he knew it's impossible. </p><p>He also bought a pack of small handmade gifts to give to the employees later. </p><p> </p><p>As he finished sorting his luggage, Jesse walked out of his room, turned on the music of his favorite playlist, and started cleaning up. He vacuumed the living room. Thankfully his current house is not a big one and he didn't have much furniture in his living room. Just a fluffy sofa, a small cabinet to put his books, DVDs, and a TV above it even though he barely turned it ON. So it didn't take a lot of time to clean it. Once he finished cleaning the living area, he moved to the kitchen. There was more dust there since it was in the corner. The rotten food in the fridge also needed to be thrown before the smells came out. He also cleaned the three cabinets above the sink before more dust came. As he wiped the glass of the cabinet, he could hear a growl of his stomach. If Jesse remembered, he hadn't eaten anything since this morning. He was too caught up with cleaning up, he didn't even feel hungry at all. He wanted to make something but he hadn't cleaned the bedrooms yet. He moved to his own room and vacuumed it quickly. He placed the vacuum cleaner back to its place as he skipped to clean the other room because no one would use it. Charlotte was still busy with school and preparing for her exams. He didn't think she would come this month.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse went back to the kitchen to make a couple of sandwiches. He wanted to eat karee but his stomach had growled so loud. He didn't have time to make it. He could just walk to go to the market but it's not closer to his house. So he decided to make sandwiches instead. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse took a couple of eggs and a beef inside the fridge and started cooking them. He also started making tea. Jesse loves tea. His grandma used to serve him with tea when they lived together and he loved the taste. It brought him a calm and peaceful mind. As he finished making his sandwiches, he walked to the sofa. A big and fluffy sofa. He fed himself peacefully, enjoying every bite of the sandwich. As he chewed the beef, his mind was going somewhere else. He felt like there was something he forgot. He looked around to check if there was something he missed besides cleaning the visitor room. But he didn't find anything. He made sure that he finished everything.</p><p> </p><p>"What did I miss?" Jesse mumbled to no one but himself. He looked at the window and spotted something that surprised him.</p><p> </p><p>He forgot about the plant.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse just simply forgot about it.</p><p> </p><p>He swallowed the sandwich and drank his tea to wash it from his throat. He walked towards the plant and worries increased in his body.</p><p> </p><p>"What should I do… " </p><p> </p><p>Jesse never grew a plant before. Little did he know about it. Charlotte only told him to watered it and made sure it got enough sunlight. He forgot to do more research about it.</p><p>More importantly, it was Charlotte's gift. He always treasured every single thing that Charlotte gave to him. But this plant, he really forgot it. He didn't even ask the name of this plant so he had no idea to replace it with a new one. He could only stare blankly at his dead plant as he leaned his head on his palm and let out a long sigh.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to buy a new one.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>After washing his dishes, Jesse spent around 2 hours on his desk completing the work that was piling up. It was around 5 o'clock in the afternoon and he still had a lot of time before the end of the day. He busied himself with another thing, which was looking for the same flower as his dead plant on the internet. He had tried so many keywords to find it but still nothing. Probably because his brain wasn't functioning well, he forgot that he could try to look in Google Image instead of words. However, he found something that caught his eyes. </p><p>
  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnmy21ppj00kabs/Green%20White%20Minimalist%20Aesthetic%20Plant%20and%20Flower%20Shop%20Logo.png?raw=1" alt="" width="210" height="210" align="center"/>
</p><p>He clicked the image and it directed him to a website of a flower shop. A new flower shop that just opened a couple weeks ago. He looked at the address and it was close enough from his house. Jesse could even walk there. He didn't need more time to think. He had changed his clothes, took his hat, then went out to buy a new plant. </p><p> </p><p>It took around 15 minutes for Jesse to arrive at the shop. A smile etched on his lips as he saw a pink blossom board hanging with floral ornaments at both corners and written La Vie En Rose in the center. It looked prettier than what he had seen earlier. The shop was not big, but it was decorated well. As he stepped inside, Jesse felt like he just entered a magical garden. The ambiance was exuding elegance, sophistication, and beauty. He also smelled some scents that brought him a peaceful and relaxing mind. He couldn't help but look around the shop with sparkling eyes. Jesse had no idea about flowers, but he found the beauty in them. </p><p> </p><p>He was looking around to see the flowers but then someone caught his eyes.</p><p>There was a man sitting on the desk with flowers around him. Jesse could only see his back. He wore a white t-shirt and a black denim dungaree as an outer. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse took off his hat and walked closer to him. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me…" Jesse asked politely.</p><p> </p><p>But the man didn't move. Maybe Jesse's voice was too soft. He cleared his throat, slightly bent to make him closer and tried again.</p><p> </p><p>"... Ummm, Excuse me…" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But still, he didn't get any answers. Jesse bit his lower lips as he thought about something. </p><p> </p><p>Was it okay if he patted his shoulder gently?</p><p> </p><p>As Jesse tried to reach the man's shoulder, he saw him move from his seat. He was turned around and startled by Jesse's existence who was slightly bent behind him. The man stumbled and before he fell, Jesse managed to catch him on his back and brought him closer to his face. He was so close as he could feel his hair on his lips and smell its scent. </p><p> </p><p>It smelled like a peach blossom. It was sweet like honey and almond.</p><p> </p><p>The man raised his head and caused them to lock their eyes unintentionally. It was just a few seconds but Jesse captured him with his eyes so well.</p><p> </p><p>The man has long eyelashes, a small nose and small lips. He even has a pretty nostril. His skin looked so smooth. Jesse could say it was ethereal. </p><p> </p><p>He looked so beautiful… </p><p> </p><p>He looked even more beautiful than the flowers around him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse almost forgot how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't hear anything but his pounding heart. It was so loud and he started worrying that the man might hear it. </p><p> </p><p>He pushed Jesse from him and bowed to him as an apology. He was going to leave Jesse but then he came back. His lips widened as he realized something. He signaled Jesse to wait for him as he walked inside the small room behind him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse blinked as he was stunned to speak. He didn't move at all until the man came with a tablet hanging on his neck and a phone in his hand. He showed something on his tablet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Welcome to La Vie En Rose.</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>A world where the flowers bloom.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>He swiped the screen. </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Is there anything I can help you with?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He swiped it again.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I'm a deaf, so I'm using it as our translator. It might be a bit troublesome, but I'm so good at flowers. Don't hesitate to ask me anything. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He gave a radiant smile to Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>Once again, Jesse was stunned to speak. It took a few minutes for him to realize that the man was waiting for his answer. Jesse stuttered before he could tell what he needed.</p><p> </p><p>"Umm… I'm looking for this kind of plant. I… I don't know the name of it though, I only have a picture of it."</p><p>The man checked his phone, then he nodded. Jesse showed him a pic of his dead plant. It took a few seconds for him to get what Jesse wanted.</p><p>He guided Jesse to the corner of the shop and showed him the plant that he asked for.</p><p> </p><p>It was the same as Charlotte gave to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Can I grow this one?" Jesse asked. </p><p>The man checked on his phone again and nodded. But before that, he typed something long on his tablet. He showed it to Jesse. He let Jesse read it as he made a thin line on his lips. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Yes, you can grow it if you want. But it would be more difficult in this season because this one needed more special care to survive in summer.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>"Aaaaah… " Jesse nodded as he understood the problem. Charlotte didn't tell him about it. He doubted she knew about it. Jesse even started to think that she probably picked a random plant as a gift for him. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you have any recommendations for me? I'm a beginner." Jesse asked him shyly. He knew so well that he had no idea about plants, but he wanted to try it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>…… Jesse probably just wanted to talk to him longer.</p><p> </p><p>The man nodded and guided Jesse to the opposite side. This corner seemed designed for a beginner like him. There were various small plants on the shelf. Jesse looked at them one by one. Honestly, he couldn't even be concrete at all. His heart still beat faster and he could feel his neck had turned so red. He took a glance at the man whenever he could. The man had stopped his step and waved at Jesse as he pointed a small pot of a green plant in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse read the plant's name and turned his face to the man beside him.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p><em>I think Jade is the best for you if you want to try to grow a plant in summer.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse's lips pursed a bit as he waited for another word from him.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p align="left">
    <em>Jade is a relatively hands-off plant. Just make sure it has bright, indirect light, and well draining-soil. Water it more frequently in spring and summer.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse gave a small nod. He looked at the man who was typing again on his tablet.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>But make sure the soil is never soggy.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse nodded again. The man gave him a bright smile that made Jesse's heart beat faster again. He would take this plant but before that, he had to make sure that he knew it clearly. So he asked the man again as he tried to buy some time.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm, ho-how many times should I water it?"</p><p> </p><p><em>Damn</em>. Jesse cursed himself inside because he couldn't stop stuttering. </p><p> </p><p>The man read his phone again then looked into Jesse. He typed something on his tablet again. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Usually it's once every 2 or 3 weeks. But it would be better if you check it regularly. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse's lips pursed and gave a small nod. He told him that he would take it. He asked Jesse to wait as he prepared a box to put the plant on it. Jesse chose to take a seat kinda far from him. He needed to calm his heart.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to calm his pounding heart, but at the same time, he couldn't keep himself from looking at him.</p><p> </p><p>Even the way he packed the plant on the box while smiling was so beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>"Can you stop… pounding hard like this… " Jesse mumbled to himself as he punched his chest gently. He looked at the man again. The man raised his head as if he could feel that someone looked at him. He gave a nod as he signaled that he had finished. Jesse stood up and followed him to the cashier to pay it. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse saw him write something on a note and handed it to him with the box of his plant. It was a simple note of how to grow a Jade. Jesse thought that maybe the man wanted him to remember this. He read the two last sentences at the bottom of the paper.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Please come again later. Thank you!</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>"<em>Could you please write your name on it too?</em>" Jesse wanted to ask that but he kept it. He didn't have the guts to ask. Not for now. </p><p> </p><p>The man bid him goodbye and smiled brightly at him. The brightest smile he ever seen in his life. Jesse nodded and walked slowly out the shop.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse stopped his step and looked at the man for the last time. He saw him waving slowly at him.</p><p> </p><p>He waved at him while smiling.</p><p> </p><p>He looked so cute…</p><p> </p><p>He looked so damn cute and Jesse couldn't hide his cheeks that started getting pink. </p><p> </p><p>He turned his face and walked away from the shop with a pounding heart. It was getting louder than before. Jesse couldn't stop smiling as he tried to take a deep breath.</p><p> </p><p>He had made sure that he would come again sooner. </p><p> </p><p>He had promised to himself that he would get his name.The name of the owner of the most beautiful smile that he just saw a few minutes ago.</p><hr/><p> </p>
