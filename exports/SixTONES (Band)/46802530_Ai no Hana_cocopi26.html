<div class="userstuff">
  <p> </p><p>"<em> Oniichan..</em>."</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> wake up!"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse tried to open his heavy eyes as someone shook his body, calling his name, waking him up in this early midnight summer. He tried to reach his clock on his desk but he couldn't find it as someone held his hands.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Charlotte?"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em>!"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Happy birthday!!" Charlotte said cheerfully with her bright smile as though Jesse, his brother, could see it. Jesse had woken up forcibly after Charlotte grabbed his wrist. His lap was full of a cake, which he still couldn't recognize, with candles saying 26 on it. He heard Charlotte take a deep breath before she started singing. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday dear Oniichan… </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Happy birthday to you… </em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Her voice sounded so soft yet cheerful. Jesse clapped his hands with Charlotte when she finished her singing. Jesse had opened his eyes wide as he saw the beautiful candle had lit. He crossed his fingers and made a wish before he blew it. A soft smile etched on his lips as Charlotte circled her arms around his broad shoulders. She turned ON the lamp and Jesse could see everything clearly. It was a small round white chocolate baked cake with flower-shaped colorful whipped cream around it. There was a handwritten Happy Birthday and three cherries in the corner. It was simple yet beautiful and quite satisfying to his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you bake it?" </p><p>Charlotte nodded as she smiled softly. Knowing how hard she tried caused warmth inside his heart. Jesse knew Charlotte never baked a cake before. She can cook, indeed, but just simple cooking. Their grandma was the one who cooked for them everyday.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis, the first child in their family and Charlotte Lewis, her sister, used to live with their grandparents. Their parents had passed away 7 years ago because of an airplane accident. They were on a business trip to LA and wanted to come back to Japan to celebrate Jesse's birthday.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>But fate said otherwise.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was so tough for them, especially Charlotte because she was still 9 years old at that time. Of course it was so <em> damn </em>difficult for Jesse too. He had been blaming himself for years because he thought everything happened because of him.</p><p> </p><p>Because they wanted to celebrate his birthday. </p><p> </p><p>If he didn't ask them, they might still be here with him.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>His grandma had come to pick them up and asked them to live together in their house in Osaka. They didn't have any reason to say no. It was too painful for Jesse if he kept living only with Charlotte in their house in Tokyo. Jesse, who was still fifteen, had to study harder because he had to take care of his father's company. His grandpa had been taking the role as the chairman and he needed Jesse to help him. So Jesse learned a lot from him. He went to college and graduated with a master degree in Business and Management. He had planned to go for a PhD but his grandpa asked him to be the CEO of Lewis Company. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Jesse, you've studied hard these years. It's time for you to become your father's successor. Come and join me." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That's why he postponed his PhD programs and joined his grandpa in their company. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Charlotte, on the other hand, had been taken care of by her grandmother. She had been in a private school. She had been planning to go to a Science and Technology University. </p><p>Jesse had been living alone in Tokyo since he turned 22, to make it easier for him because it's closer to Lewis Company. He felt lonely, of course. He has no one but Charlotte and his grandparents. So Jesse tried another way to wash his loneliness. </p><p> </p><p>He was in a relationship.</p><p> </p><p>He had been in a relationship before, but she dumped him. </p><p> </p><p>She said that he was too busy. </p><p>She didn't love him anymore.</p><p> </p><p>A classic reason for someone who already knew who she dated.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Jesse really did his best to give his time for her. He had spent his weekend with her, letting her plan anything that she wanted for them. Somehow they went on dates, watched movies, or just spent their time in Jesse's house. Jesse really loved her and he felt delighted to be with her. She was a sweet girl with a sweet voice and a radiant smile. She was full of kindness and caring. She has long black hair that reached her back and Jesse used to play it while they were cuddling or when she leaned on Jesse's chest while watching a movie. He had a joyful time with her.</p><p> </p><p>Especially on his birthday.  </p><p> </p><p>Somehow Jesse celebrated it alone. Somehow with his family in Osaka. They had celebrated in the usual way, but Jesse couldn't hide his sadness. </p><p> </p><p>He had celebrated his birthday once with his girlfriend. His ex-girlfriend. It was just two of them but the atmosphere was warm. He felt delighted to celebrate it with her, especially since his birthday was the saddest day for him because it was the same day as the death anniversary for his parents. Her existence gave him a new color in his life. It didn't mean that he didn't feel thankful to his family, but it was just more like he could share his pain with her and tried to cover the hole in his heart. </p><p>It was so painful for him when she asked him to break up. He asked her the reasons, but when she said that he was too busy and it made her not love him anymore, he gave up. It was cruel, indeed. But maybe she wasn't for him.</p><p>So he moved on. It had been two years since the last time he celebrated his birthday with her. Since last year, Charlotte had been coming to his home to celebrate his birthday because he couldn't leave his work here.</p><p> </p><p>Last year, Charlotte had prepared a small birthday party for him. She had come with their grandparents. Some of his childhood friends had also come. Jesse had a lot of fun and felt so grateful for their love.</p><p>Tonight, Charlotte had come alone in this midnight early summer. Honestly, he wasn't sure whether she had come alone or with their grandparents again. So he tried to look for them in his entire house and he found no one but Charlotte and him. He went back to sleep last night on his own bed and Charlotte in the other room. He had been living alone but he still had two bedrooms in his house. Just in case, if he had a visitor beside his family. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">*****</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse blinked his eyes slowly as he tried to open his eyes. He woke up after smelling something delicious coming from the kitchen. He checked his clock on his desk. It was 9 in the morning. He walked through the door and saw Charlotte had finished preparing their meals.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! You woke up. Good morning!"</p><p> </p><p>"Please have a seat." Charlotte said with her cheerful tone. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, I need to wash my face first." </p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked towards his bathroom. He took his toothbrush that hung under the mirror. As he washed his teeth, Charlotte called him. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want tea or coffee?"</p><p>"Teaaa!!" Jesse said with his loud voice. As he finished washing his face, he walked to the kitchen and took a seat on their dining table. </p><p> </p><p>"You know I've learned a lot, so don't worry. It tastes good." Charlotte said with confidence. Jesse let out a chuckle and did what she ordered. To be honest, it was a common breakfast for him. She prepared steamed rice, a bowl of miso soup, a grilled fish as the main dish, <em> tamagoyaki </em> , and a small plate of pickled vegetables. Jesse slurped the miso soup and it tasted so good. His eyes were closed and he couldn't stop humming to show how yummy the miso soup was. Then he took a bite of the grilled fish and his eyes widened as he chewed the fish. The texture was soft and it blended well with the miso soup. He took a piece of <em> tamagoyaki </em> in one bite and took his steamed rice in a big bite. He was eating it peacefully. He didn't even realize that Charlotte hadn't taken any bite because she was busy watching him. </p><p>"... Does it taste so good or are you just hungry?" Charlotte asked jokingly.</p><p>"..... Both, I guess." Jesse said and he laughed freely.</p><p>"Are you going back today?"</p><p>"Yup. Grandma said she wanted to go to onsen and I will come with her."</p><p>"I see… Anyway, please tell her I might come at the end of this year."</p><p>"Okaaaay~~"</p><p> </p><p>They kept their focus back to their food, finishing it and cleaning the table. Jesse helped with the dishes as he let his sister take a shower first. </p><p>His eyes caught something on his table. A pot of a plant. He had been wondering since when he bought a plant. He never did it before, or he did?</p><p>"Oh! I forgot to tell you. That was my gift for you." Charlotte said in front of her room when she finished changing her clothes.</p><p> </p><p>"A plant?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"<em> Oniichan </em> said you're lonely, right? So I bought you a plant. I can adopt a dog or a cat for you though but you're busy. Pet needs the owner to play with them. So I bought a plant. It is easier to feed and you can talk with them too."</p><p>Jesse eyebrows furrowed as his lips pursed. He felt thankful to Charlotte for her gift. But he had never grown a plant before. He couldn't help but worry about what if the plant wilted because he forgot it?</p><p>"Just put it around your windows, make sure it gets sunlight and water every morning. It's easy, <em> Oniichan </em>." Charlotte said as she read his mind. Jesse gave a nod and grinned as he said thank you to her.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked his sister to the front door and bid her goodbye. He closed the door and went back to the kitchen to take his plant. He put them in his living area, close to his window, then he watered it.</p><p> </p><p>"Eat well, grow well..." Jesse said before he walked to the bathroom and got ready to go to work.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It has been a month since Charlotte gave this plant to him.</p><p> </p><p>It has been a week since the last time he watered it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Last week was so hectic for Jesse. He had flown to LA and London to attend important meetings. He just arrived in Japan yesterday and he didn't even check his entire house or clean up the pile of dust in his house. His body and his brain needed some rest. </p><p> </p><p>He just had time today. After taking more than 10 hours of sleep, he finally woke up.</p><p> </p><p>More precisely, he forced himself to wake up.</p><p> </p><p>It was so difficult to open his heavy eyes in the morning though. His bed gravity was too strong and caused him to stumble a few times as he tried to bring his body up. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse just realized that he didn't change his suit last night. He started remembering that after loosening his tie, he dived to his bed without even taking off his socks. </p><p> </p><p>It was around 3 in the afternoon. After taking a bath, he was unpacking his luggage and sorting every sheet of his clothes. He didn't forget to buy some gifts for his beloved people.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse bought a bottle of fragrance with Orange Blossom Cologne for Charlotte because he knew that his little sister loves perfume and it would fit her perfectly if Jesse remembered how bright she is as a person. He bought hampers of The Afternoon Tea Collection for her grandma because she is a tea-lover. Meanwhile, for his grandpa, he only bought him a set of Lewis Chessmen Chess.</p><p> </p><p>No, no. He didn't buy it because there was <em>Lewis</em> on it. He didn't. He just simply bought it because his grandpa loves an old-stuff and he loves playing chess. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse bought all of them in London because he never wanted to be in LA too long. It is such a crucial place for him. He wished he would never visit that place again but he knew it's impossible. </p><p>He also bought a pack of small handmade gifts to give to the employees later. </p><p> </p><p>As he finished sorting his luggage, Jesse walked out of his room, turned on the music of his favorite playlist, and started cleaning up. He vacuumed the living room. Thankfully his current house is not a big one and he didn't have much furniture in his living room. Just a fluffy sofa, a small cabinet to put his books, DVDs, and a TV above it even though he barely turned it ON. So it didn't take a lot of time to clean it. Once he finished cleaning the living area, he moved to the kitchen. There was more dust there since it was in the corner. The rotten food in the fridge also needed to be thrown before the smells came out. He also cleaned the three cabinets above the sink before more dust came. As he wiped the glass of the cabinet, he could hear a growl of his stomach. If Jesse remembered, he hadn't eaten anything since this morning. He was too caught up with cleaning up, he didn't even feel hungry at all. He wanted to make something but he hadn't cleaned the bedrooms yet. He moved to his own room and vacuumed it quickly. He placed the vacuum cleaner back to its place as he skipped to clean the other room because no one would use it. Charlotte was still busy with school and preparing for her exams. He didn't think she would come this month.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse went back to the kitchen to make a couple of sandwiches. He wanted to eat karee but his stomach had growled so loud. He didn't have time to make it. He could just walk to go to the market but it's not closer to his house. So he decided to make sandwiches instead. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse took a couple of eggs and a beef inside the fridge and started cooking them. He also started making tea. Jesse loves tea. His grandma used to serve him with tea when they lived together and he loved the taste. It brought him a calm and peaceful mind. As he finished making his sandwiches, he walked to the sofa. A big and fluffy sofa. He fed himself peacefully, enjoying every bite of the sandwich. As he chewed the beef, his mind was going somewhere else. He felt like there was something he forgot. He looked around to check if there was something he missed besides cleaning the visitor room. But he didn't find anything. He made sure that he finished everything.</p><p> </p><p>"What did I miss?" Jesse mumbled to no one but himself. He looked at the window and spotted something that surprised him.</p><p> </p><p>He forgot about the plant.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse just simply forgot about it.</p><p> </p><p>He swallowed the sandwich and drank his tea to wash it from his throat. He walked towards the plant and worries increased in his body.</p><p> </p><p>"What should I do… " </p><p> </p><p>Jesse never grew a plant before. Little did he know about it. Charlotte only told him to watered it and made sure it got enough sunlight. He forgot to do more research about it.</p><p>More importantly, it was Charlotte's gift. He always treasured every single thing that Charlotte gave to him. But this plant, he really forgot it. He didn't even ask the name of this plant so he had no idea to replace it with a new one. He could only stare blankly at his dead plant as he leaned his head on his palm and let out a long sigh.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to buy a new one.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>After washing his dishes, Jesse spent around 2 hours on his desk completing the work that was piling up. It was around 5 o'clock in the afternoon and he still had a lot of time before the end of the day. He busied himself with another thing, which was looking for the same flower as his dead plant on the internet. He had tried so many keywords to find it but still nothing. Probably because his brain wasn't functioning well, he forgot that he could try to look in Google Image instead of words. However, he found something that caught his eyes. </p><p>
  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xnmy21ppj00kabs/Green%20White%20Minimalist%20Aesthetic%20Plant%20and%20Flower%20Shop%20Logo.png?raw=1" alt="" width="210" height="210" align="center"/>
</p><p>He clicked the image and it directed him to a website of a flower shop. A new flower shop that just opened a couple weeks ago. He looked at the address and it was close enough from his house. Jesse could even walk there. He didn't need more time to think. He had changed his clothes, took his hat, then went out to buy a new plant. </p><p> </p><p>It took around 15 minutes for Jesse to arrive at the shop. A smile etched on his lips as he saw a pink blossom board hanging with floral ornaments at both corners and written <em>La Vie En Rose</em> in the center. It looked prettier than what he had seen earlier. The shop was not big, but it was decorated well. As he stepped inside, Jesse felt like he just entered a magical garden. The ambiance was exuding elegance, sophistication, and beauty. He also smelled some scents that brought him a peaceful and relaxing mind. He couldn't help but look around the shop with sparkling eyes. Jesse had no idea about flowers, but he found the beauty in them. </p><p> </p><p>He was looking around to see the flowers but then someone caught his eyes.</p><p>There was a man sitting on the desk with flowers around him. Jesse could only see his back. He wore a white t-shirt and a black denim dungaree as an outer. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse took off his hat and walked closer to him. </p><p> </p><p>"Excuse me…" Jesse asked politely.</p><p> </p><p>But the man didn't move. Maybe Jesse's voice was too soft. He cleared his throat, slightly bent to make him closer and tried again.</p><p> </p><p>"... Ummm, Excuse me…" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But still, he didn't get any answers. Jesse bit his lower lips as he thought about something. </p><p> </p><p>Was it okay if he patted his shoulder gently?</p><p> </p><p>As Jesse tried to reach the man's shoulder, he saw him move from his seat. He was turned around and startled by Jesse's existence who was slightly bent behind him. The man stumbled and before he fell, Jesse managed to catch him on his back and brought him closer to his face. He was so close as he could feel his hair on his lips and smell its scent. </p><p> </p><p>It smelled like a peach blossom. It was sweet like honey and almond.</p><p> </p><p>The man raised his head and caused them to lock their eyes unintentionally. It was just a few seconds but Jesse captured him with his eyes so well.</p><p> </p><p>The man has long eyelashes, a small nose and small lips. He even has a pretty nostril. His skin looked so smooth. Jesse could say it was ethereal. </p><p> </p><p>He looked so beautiful… </p><p> </p><p>He looked even more beautiful than the flowers around him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse almost forgot how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't hear anything but his pounding heart. It was so loud and he started worrying that the man might hear it. </p><p> </p><p>He pushed Jesse from him and bowed to him as an apology. He was going to leave Jesse but then he came back. His lips widened as he realized something. He signaled Jesse to wait for him as he walked inside the small room behind him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse blinked as he was stunned to speak. He didn't move at all until the man came with a tablet hanging on his neck and a phone in his hand. He showed something on his tablet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Welcome to La Vie En Rose.</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>A world where the flowers bloom.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>He swiped the screen. </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Is there anything I can help you with?</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He swiped it again.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I'm a deaf, so I'm using it as our translator. It might be a bit troublesome, but I'm so good at flowers. Don't hesitate to ask me anything. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He gave a radiant smile to Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>Once again, Jesse was stunned to speak. It took a few minutes for him to realize that the man was waiting for his answer. Jesse stuttered before he could tell what he needed.</p><p> </p><p>"Umm… I'm looking for this kind of plant. I… I don't know the name of it though, I... only have a picture of it."</p><p>The man checked his phone, then he nodded. Jesse showed him a pic of his dead plant. It took a few seconds for him to get what Jesse wanted.</p><p>He guided Jesse to the corner of the shop and showed him the plant that he asked for.</p><p> </p><p>It was the same as Charlotte gave to him.</p><p> </p><p>"C-can I grow this one?" Jesse asked. </p><p>The man checked on his phone again and nodded. But before that, he typed something long on his tablet. He showed it to Jesse. He let Jesse read it as he made a thin line on his lips. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Yes, you can grow it if you want. But it would be more difficult in this season because this one needed more special care to survive in summer.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>"Aaaaah… " Jesse nodded as he understood the problem. Charlotte didn't tell him about it. He doubted she knew about it. Jesse even started to think that she probably picked a random plant as a gift for him. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you... have any recommendations... for me?I-... I'm a beginner." Jesse asked him shyly. He knew so well that he had no idea about plants, but he wanted to try it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>…… Jesse probably just wanted to talk to him longer.</p><p> </p><p>The man nodded and guided Jesse to the opposite side. This corner seemed designed for a beginner like him. There were various small plants on the shelf. Jesse looked at them one by one. Honestly, he couldn't even be concrete at all. His heart still beat faster and he could feel his neck had turned so red. He took a glance at the man whenever he could. The man had stopped his step and waved at Jesse as he pointed a small pot of a green plant in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse read the plant's name and turned his face to the man beside him.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p><em>I think Jade is the best for you if you want to try to grow a plant in summer.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse's lips pursed a bit as he waited for another word from him.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p align="left">
    <em>Jade is a relatively hands-off plant. Just make sure it has bright, indirect light, and well draining-soil. Water it more frequently in spring and summer.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse gave a small nod. He looked at the man who was typing again on his tablet.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>But make sure the soil is never soggy.</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse nodded again. The man gave him a bright smile that made Jesse's heart beat faster again. He would take this plant but before that, he had to make sure that he knew it clearly. So he asked the man again as he tried to buy some time.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm, ho-how many times should I water it?"</p><p> </p><p><em>Damn</em>. Jesse cursed himself inside because he couldn't stop stuttering. </p><p> </p><p>The man read his phone again then looked into Jesse. He typed something on his tablet again. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Usually it's once every 2 or 3 weeks. But it would be better if you check it regularly. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse's lips pursed and gave a small nod. He told him that he would take it. He asked Jesse to wait as he prepared a box to put the plant on it. Jesse chose to take a seat kinda far from him. He needed to calm his heart.</p><p> </p><p>He needed to calm his pounding heart, but at the same time, he couldn't keep himself from looking at him.</p><p> </p><p>Even the way he packed the plant on the box while smiling was so beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>"Can you stop… pounding hard like this… " Jesse mumbled to himself as he punched his chest gently. He looked at the man again. The man raised his head as if he could feel that someone looked at him. He gave a nod as he signaled that he had finished. Jesse stood up and followed him to the cashier to pay it. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse saw him write something on a note and handed it to him with the box of his plant. It was a simple note of how to grow a Jade. Jesse thought that maybe the man wanted him to remember this. He read the two last sentences at the bottom of the paper.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Please come again later. Thank you!</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>"<em>Could you please write your name on it too?</em>" Jesse wanted to ask that but he kept it. He didn't have the guts to ask. Not for now. </p><p> </p><p>The man bid him goodbye and smiled brightly at him. The brightest smile he ever seen in his life. Jesse nodded and walked slowly out the shop.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse stopped his step and looked at the man for the last time. He saw him waving slowly at him.</p><p> </p><p>He waved at him while smiling.</p><p> </p><p>He looked so cute…</p><p> </p><p>He looked so damn cute and Jesse couldn't hide his cheeks that started getting pink. </p><p> </p><p>He turned his face and walked away from the shop with a pounding heart. It was getting louder than before. Jesse couldn't stop smiling as he tried to take a deep breath.</p><p> </p><p>He had made sure that he would come again sooner. </p><p> </p><p>He had promised to himself that he would get his name.The name of the owner of the most beautiful smile that he just saw a few minutes ago.</p><hr/><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Jesse had finished his lunch box on his sofa. It had been thirty minutes but he still hadn't moved from his seat. He crossed his legs and leaned his back on the sofa. He closed his eyes as his mind was going somewhere. He almost fell asleep but someone interrupted him by knocking on his door. </p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Lewis?" Juri walked in his room. </p><p> </p><p>"These are some new documents that need your signature, Sir." He placed a pile of paper on Jesse's desk and bowed as he took a permit to leave Jesse's room. Jesse opened his eyes and walked towards his desk. He took a seat and started to check the document. He read the pages carefully while twirling the pen in his hand. He didn't know how long he spent reading one document as he heard Juri had opened his door again and walked towards him. </p><p> </p><p>"These are some new proposals that need your review, Sir." He placed the new pile paper beside the papers that he just placed earlier. He bowed again and took a permit as he walked out. Jesse couldn't say anything as he saw there were 2 piled up documents on his desk. He looked at the document that he had been reading and realized that he had reached the last page. He was going to give his signature but then he realized something.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't even know what the document was about. </p><p> </p><p>He clearly read it, he knew it. But he didn't remember anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>He lost his concentration while checking the document as his mind was still going somewhere. Jesse let out a long sigh. He leaned on his seat, closing his eyes and placing his arm on his forehead.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed again and placed his jaw on his hand. Jesse felt like he wanted to empty his lungs from the misty air as he let out a long and deep sigh again, again, and again. He didn't know how long he had been doing it until he heard Juri asked him, "Why do you keep sighing?" Jesse raised his head and found Juri was sitting on the sofa.</p><p> </p><p>"How long have you been here?" Jesse asked as his eyebrows furrowed. He got too caught up with his own thoughts. He didn't even realize Juri's existence in his room.</p><p> </p><p>"Since 30 minutes ago. I brought you some documents." Juri said as he pointed a pile of documents in front of Jesse. He realized that there were 3 piles of documents on his desk that needed to be checked. </p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, is this a new bouquet? Don't you think you have been buying too much? You didn't even give it to anyone." Juri said as he screened the room and found many bouquets placed around. "This is the… 7th? 8th… flower bouquet that you bought in the past two weeks." Juri continued. Jesse let out a long sigh again this time. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Why do you keep sighing?" Juri asked him again. "It's so rare to see you like that. Do you have something bothering you?" Juri continued. Jesse didn't give him any answer. He buried his face in his palm, ignoring Juri's voice that kept calling him.</p><p> </p><p>"Jesse?"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Jesse… ?"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Jes-..." Jesse let out a deep sigh before Juri could continue his words.</p><p> </p><p>"I-... Am I bothering you?" Juri said as he placed his hand on his chest, eyes widening in surprise. Jesse let out a whine instead of giving Juri any answer. He leaned back on his seat and let his hands hang down. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, I'm leaving!" Juri said as he stood up from his seat. He was going to walk out but his steps had stopped as Jesse finally let his words out. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Juri… " He said. He looked at Juri lazily. "How do you ask someone's name?" He looked at Juri who stared at him in astonishment. </p><p> </p><p>"...... D-did you….. Did you just ask me how to ask someone's name?" Juri repeated Jesse's question. Jesse only nodded slowly. He knew Juri would give this reaction. He knew Juri might laugh at him because Juri knew how Jesse managed to deal with people especially when he became a CEO. Juri was Jesse's old friend. They had known each other in highschool. Jesse met him again accidentally when his grandpa helped him to find some candidates to be his secretary. That was also the reason he didn't need much time to decide who he wanted to be his right hand. They had been working together for years and knew each other so well. Of course Juri would laugh at him for his question.</p><p> </p><p>"Jesse Lewis doesn't know how to ask someone's name?" Juri let out a chuckle. Jesse glared at him before he let out his words, "Are you making fun of me?" He asked, his body had straightened on his seat. Juri pursed his lips a bit and averted his eyes from Jesse. "If you don't want to help, then go out." Jesse continued before he placed his elbow on his desk, he leaned his head on his palm as if it could bear his thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry." Juri said quietly. There was a silence between them before Juri continued his words, "Who do you want to ask anyway? Is it a stranger woman that you met on the street? Or a woman that you met randomly in a restaurant? Or a woman in a coffee shop? Or a baked shop? Or som….— " Jesse didn't hear the rest of Juri's questions as he sighed again. He felt tired and started massaging his temples. He sighed again before he cut Juri by his own words, "It's someone… you don't know." Jesse said as he saw Juri still didn't move from his seat.</p><p> </p><p>"Aaaaah…" Juri said before he walked towards Jesse and took a seat in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>"Who is it?" Juri asked in curiosity. He grinned and placed his jaw in his palm with his elbows resting on the desk.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't have to know… " Jesse said quietly. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh come on!!" Juri leaned on his seat, showing his disappointment after hearing Jesse's answer. </p><p> </p><p>"Why do you have to know?" Jesse asked as he felt irritated. </p><p> </p><p>"Because I'm curious." Juri said casually. Jesse wanted to tell him about it, but he didn't know how to say it. His mind was complicated with his own thoughts about <em> how to get your name </em> as <em> your name </em>was referring to the same person that he had been thinking about in the last 2 months.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you free after this?" Jesse asked directly.</p><p> </p><p>"Yep. What? You want to go out with me?" Juri teased him as he raised his eyebrow, giving Jesse goosebumps.</p><p> </p><p>"Help me to get the name." Jesse said. He felt desperate and he needed Juri to help him as he knew how good Juri could be with <em> this </em>thing.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***** </p><p> </p><p>"Where are we going?"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse let out a long sigh. It had been the 7th time Juri asked the same question to him. He hadn't told Juri where they would go because he didn't know how to explain it to Juri, so he would just let him figure it out by himself.</p><p> </p><p>"Here." Jesse said as he asked Juri to pull over. Juri parked Jesse's car on the side of the road. They took off the belt and got out of the car. They were still in office suits as Jesse didn't want to change because they just finished their work late. He was worried that the shop might be closed soon.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked in a big step and left Juri behind him who tried to chase him by running. They had stopped their steps as they had arrived in front of the flower shop. The same flower shop that he had been visiting for the past 2 weeks. He left Juri behind who was whining as he realized that they would buy another bouquet. It was amazing for Jesse who had been visiting this place many times, but it was still giving him the same feeling as the first time he came. <em> La Vie En Rose </em>is really like a magical garden. He didn't mind to fill his lungs with the elegance and sweet of the flower scents. He wouldn't feel tired with the beauty of flowers around him that satisfy his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Especially the beauty of the florist… </p><p> </p><p>He looked so beautiful as always. Jesse didn't know how someone could look beautiful every day. He even felt the florist looked more beautiful today. He wore a cream t-shirt and an olive dungaree. It was kinda funny how he always wore dungaree whenever Jesse came.  Jesse saw him taking a seat and sighed. Seemed like he just finished cleaning some trash that scattered around. </p><p> </p><p>"He looks tired… " Jesse murmured.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm?" Juri asked him, making Jesse realize that he had been watching the man too deep.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing…"</p><p> </p><p>"Let's go." He walked first before Juri without looking how confused Juri was. They walked closer towards the man who was resting his head on his palm. Jesse felt guilty for bothering him, but he couldn't help it. Jesse waved at him and smiled softly.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse was right. He looked tired but he kept smiling at him. He bowed and took a permit to go back and came back with a tablet and a phone in his hands. He greeted Jesse in the same way as he used to.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Welcome back! </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Is there anything I can help you with? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote><p>He smiled at them. Jesse had been seeing the same smile many times. The same smile that kept perching on his mind. But it never failed to pound his heart. Jesse had been visiting this place many times. He had been talking to him many times, but he still couldn't stop stuttering. Juri realized there was something different about Jesse. He kept glancing at him and smirked when he saw him stuttering.</p><p> </p><p>"What?" Jesse asked Juri as the man prepared to make a bouquet. Juri kept grinning for a moment before he let out his words, "Your neck is getting red." Juri said as he smirked. Jesse could feel his face getting warm. He cleaned his throat, "Can you help me?"</p><p> </p><p>"What will I get?" Juri asked. He felt his lips were drying because he smiled a lot. He couldn't help it but teasing his best friend was one of his favorite things. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse took a deep breath before making a deal with Juri.</p><p> </p><p>"I will let you use my game for a week."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Deal!" Juri said without any hesitation. They saw the man had finished making a bouquet. He looked at Jesse and gave him a smile as he nodded, signaling to follow him towards the front desk.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Do you need a card?  </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>The man asked Jesse who was stunned in front of him. He was going to say his words but Juri already gave an answer to him.</p><p> </p><p>"No, he doesn't need it. It's for me." Juri said casually, but he didn't know how surprised and pissed off Jesse was after hearing his answer, making him cursed under his breath. The man only nodded and smiled at them. He handed Juri the bouquet and bowed gently as Juri paid for it. Juri talked casually to the man as if Jesse couldn't hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Well, he couldn't hear it because his pounding heart was too loud. He felt sweat rushing down his back. He wasn't ready for this. He was scared to see the man's reaction when Juri asked his name. Jesse wanted to run away but he couldn't even move his foot. He felt his heart had stopped as he heard Juri let out a question.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, what's your name?" Juri asked. Jesse saw the man smiled and introduced himself to them using sign language. </p><p> </p><p>"Kyo… Kyou?" Juri asked as if he could read Jesse's mind. The man smiled and started writing on his tablet. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Kyomoto Taiga </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Aaaaah. Kyomoto Taiga." Juri continued. The man gave a nod and a radiant smile. </p><p> </p><p>Beautiful…</p><p> </p><p>Even his name is beautiful...</p><p> </p><p>The name is as beautiful as its owner. Jesse made a thin line on his lips as he held his smile. He tried to hide his happiness even though he could feel his ears getting red. He managed to hide his smile but he couldn't stop glancing at him. As their eyes met for a few seconds and the man smiled sweetly, Jesse thought he was going to explode. He was going to walk outside but Juri had stopped him by his words. </p><p> </p><p>"May I get your number?" Jesse's eyes widened, he turned his face to Juri who kept grinning. He continued his words, "My friend doesn't have the guts to ask you."</p><p> </p><p>Jesse felt like his face had dropped. Why did Juri ask him for his number? Jesse didn't ask him to do it. Of course he felt happy if he could get it, but it was so embarrassing. </p><p> </p><p>"Damn you, Juri." He cursed under his teeth. Jesse wasn't sure whether Juri heard it or not but he glared at him. Jesse swallowed hard. He was too embarrassed, he didn't want to know how the man looked at him. He really wanted to run away, but he couldn't even move his body. And the next thing he knew was Juri holding a note with a number on it. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Kyomoto." Juri said as he smiled. He bowed and walked away, leaving Jesse alone with the man. He looked at Jesse with his wide eyes and a thin line on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"I... Ummm... I-... Wh-... " Jesse swallowed his nerves. He didn't know what to say. His brain was too blurry and made him stutter. It had always been like this. He had been always stuttering whenever he talked to him. Jesse had lowered his face and scratched the back of his neck as he bit his bottom lip. He was too busy cursing himself under his breath, he didn't realize that the man was chuckling at him. Jesse raised his head and saw him covering his mouth. Jesse felt more embarrassed, but he felt warm at the same time. He was pleased to see the man laugh at him. </p><p> </p><p>"Umm… I-... I'm sorry." Jesse said after he calmed himself. The man shook his head and gave him a beaming smile. Jesse swore his heart was going to explode for real. He took a deep breath and continued his words, "I-... I wanted to ask you directly, but I wasn't sure how to do that." Jesse saw the man look at his phone, then shook his head again. He moved his hand from the right to the left on his chest as he said something. Jesse read his mouth and assumed that he was saying that it was fine. Jesse could only smile shyly as he saw the man kept raising his cheeks. </p><p> </p><p>"Umm… Nice to meet you, Kyomoto… " Jesse said as he scratched his own temple. The man nodded and smiled again. Jesse bid him goodbye and walked out. He didn't forget his habit to turn his face, looking at him who kept smiling and waved his hands cutely. Jesse bit his lower lips and stepped outside. As he walked, he punched his own chest gently many times because it didn't stop beating hard. He really thought his heart was going to jump out.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! Here he is~" Juri said as he saw Jesse in front of the alley. </p><p> </p><p>"Damn you!" Jesse cursed him again before he entered the car.</p><p> </p><p>"What did I do?" Juri acted innocently.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you embarrass me?" Jesse almost raised his voice. Juri really pissed him off for saying that silly thing. </p><p> </p><p>"But you like it, don't you?" Juri teased him. Jesse didn't give any answer as he turned his face, averted Juri's gaze.</p><p> </p><p>"Give me the number and I will give you the deal." He said quietly. He could hear Juri giggling next to him. "Yes, Sir." He said before drove away to drop Jess off. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Jesse had taken a shower and changed his clothes into pajamas. It was still around 9 in the evening but he had decided to sleep early tonight. Dealing with Juri was tiring. He didn't even have the energy to make dinner for himself. So he only took a piece of banana and water. He ate it lazily as he closed his eyes, his mind was traveling somewhere. A thin smile etched on his lips as he recalled a sweet memory that happened this afternoon. He still couldn't believe that he had known his name. Not only his name, but also his number. He blamed Juri for embarrassing him, but he couldn't deny that he felt thankful for him for helping him.</p><p> </p><p>As Jesse finished his dinner. He washed the glass and walked back into his room. He took his phone and laid his back on his bed. He looked at his contact and focused his eyes on a name.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga." He mumbled. He opened his LINE to check Taiga's name on his contact list, but he didn't find it.</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? He doesn't use LINE?" Jesse said as he pursed his lips. He felt it was weird if someone didn't use it, even his grandma had been using it. But Jesse thought maybe Taiga had his own reasons for not using it. He opened his messenger and started typing.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Hi, Kyomoto…" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse shook his head and deleted it. He started typing again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"Good night, Kyomoto :)" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse shook his head again and deleted it. He closed his eyes and placed his arm on his forehead. </p><p> </p><p>Why did he become like this?</p><p> </p><p>Why did it feel difficult for him to send a message?</p><p> </p><p>He could have just introduced himself as usual, but why did he have to think so hard?</p><p> </p><p>He looked at the clock on his desk and found that he had been doing it for 15 minutes. It was 9.34 at night. Jesse let out a long sigh. He clenched his hand into a first and took a deep breath. He started typing on the flat screen.</p><p> </p><p align="left">
  <em> "Kyomoto, this is Jesse. I'm one of your regular customers. We met this afternoon with my friend who asked for your number. I'm sorry if we made you uncomfortable. I hope we can be friends." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse had let out a sigh again and sent his message. He couldn't help but keep reading his text as if he made any mistake.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did I sound weird?" He mumbled. He ruffled his hair as he whined. He didn't want to wait for any answer. He didn't want to think about it. He placed his phone on his desk and turned off his lamp. He turned his back on the other side and decided to sleep, hoping to get good news tomorrow morning.</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>"Why are you pouting?" Juri asked him after he finished his 5th round of the game that he had been playing since this morning. It was around 8 a.m on Saturday and Juri had knocked on his door, waking him up from his sleep. He lazily opened his door for Juri, but he had to stop him from entering his house. Jesse was going to complain about it but he saw Juri came along with a big hand of food, so he let him in. </p><p> </p><p>As Jesse washed his face, Juri called him and served him with two pieces fresh baked bread with a garlic souce and salad. He also served him with a glass of tea. </p><p> </p><p>"Please have a seat, Sir." Juri said as he smiled.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't have to act formal like that, you know?" Jesse said casually. It was Jesse himself who told Juri not to be formal outside of work. Even though somehow Juri broke the rules by being informal when they were still at work, but Jesse didn't mind it. But it would be different if he acted formally outside of work, it could mean that Juri wanted something from him. </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" Jesse acted directly, eyes on Juri who kept grinning at him. Juri cleared his throat before saying his words, "Please let me stay here for 2 days." Jesse glared at him as he thought about something. Honestly he didn't mind if Juri wanted to stay with him, but he wanted to take advantage from him too.</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, but you have to serve meals for me."</p><p> </p><p>Juri's jaw hung for a few seconds as he looked at Jesse in disbelief. But in the end, he agreed. </p><p> </p><p>They had finished the breakfast and cleaned the kitchen. Juri had already sat in the living room, preparing the game that he wanted to play, meanwhile Jesse was going back to his room. He took his phone to check whether there was a good news or not.</p><p> </p><p>As he clicked the flat screen, he saw nothing on his notification bar. He let out a sigh and put his phone back to his desk as he walked into his bathroom. He let the warm water poured his body and washed away his gloomy thoughts. He managed to sleep peacefully last night as he dreamt about he got a reply from Taiga. But apparently it was just a dream.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse walked outside his bathroom, opening his wardrobe, picking a white t-shirt and a short pants for him. He didn't know why did he pick white t-shirt though.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Nah, he knew it. He picked it because it reminded him to Taiga.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He went out his room and greeted Juri who was too busy with his game. He sat behind him while watching him. Somehow he checked his phone to see whether he got a new message or not. But he got nothing. There was no messages. </p><p> </p><p>He placed his phone beside him and sighed. Juri heard it and turned his face to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Why are you pouting?" He asked. Jesse didn't give any answer as he pouted and scratched his fingers. </p><p> </p><p>"He doesn't reply… " He said quietly. Juri didn't even hear him as he asked again. But Jesse chose to ignore him. He stood up and walked over to his plant. He touched the leaf of the Jade as he mumbled something.</p><p> </p><p>"Shall I ask him?"</p><p> </p><p>A summer breeze suddenly come through his window, making his plant moved as if it nodded slowly. Jesse smiled and walked back to his room to take his hat. He didn't change his clothes because it was still summer and the place wasn't far from his house. </p><p> </p><p>"Juri, I'll go." He said in front of his front door, he opened it and went out, ignoring Juri who kept calling his name.</p><p> </p><p>"Wish me luck… "</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>As he arrived at <em> La Vien En Rose </em>, he looked around to find someone he needed. But he wasn't there. Taiga wasn't there. The shop had opened but no one was there. Jesse took off his hat and took a seat in the center as he waited for him to come.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse lowered his head and pouted. It had been 30 minutes but he didn't see him at all. He was giving up and wanted to leave. But then someone offered him a cup of coffee. He raised his head and saw him standing in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>With wet hair and his glowing skin, he greeted Jesse and smiled brightly at him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Welcome back! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The sunlight that radiated through the window in front of him made him look more beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse almost forgot how to breath. </p><p> </p><p>He stood up and saw the man was standing right in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>He looked gorgeous… </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had to keep himself not to land a kiss on him even though he knew it was so <em> damn </em>difficult. He shook his head and punch his thigh. How dare he thought something like this? </p><p> </p><p>He saw the man raised his index finger and shook it while giving a curious face. Jesse shook his head and told him it was fine. He offered Jesse a cup of coffee in his hand. Jesse bowed a bit and took it even though he didn't drink coffee. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Is there anything you need? </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p><em> "Yes… " </em>Jesse said under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummmm, I… I want to grow a flower." He said. He saw Taiga looked kinda surprised knowing it. He smiled and guided Jesse to the left corner of the shop. He introduced him some flowers that easy to handle in Summer. Even though this season would be over soon, but these flowers would bloom in the next season. Jesse nodded slowly after reading what Taiga wrote on his tablet.</p><p> </p><p>He was reading it, but he didn't remember it. He was too nervous and his mind kept repeating the same question that he wanted to ask. He wanted to shout it out.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> So, is there anything that caught your eyes? </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Taiga asked through his tablet.</p><p> </p><p>"You…<em> " </em>Jesse said quietly. Apparently Taiga saw him but he didn't get the word, which Jesse felt so thankful for. He cleared his throat, "Umm, this one." He said as he pointed to an Agapanthus in the upper shelf. He saw Taiga stroked his own chest gently and nodded slowly and said his words by using sign. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I understand. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Please wait here as I pack this for you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse waited for him in the same seat as before. He watched him carefully, packaging his flower and placed a note inside the box. It seemed like he put a reminder like he used to before. Jesse lowered his head, clenched his hand into a fist and bit his lower lips. He had to ask him now. He didn't want to go back home with the same feeling as when he went outside. He didn't want to.</p><p> </p><p>He raised his head and saw the man signaled that he had done. Jesse stood up and walked closer to him. Jesse took the flower after paying for it. He saw Taiga smiled and bid him goodbye as usual. But Jesse had stopped him.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummmm, Kyomoto-san… " Jesse called his name. Taiga raised his index finger and shook it again as he asked <em> what </em>to him. Jesse pushed his lips together before letting out his words, "Did… did you… Did you get my message?". Taiga looked into his phone and looked surprised.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse lowered his head and continued, "I… texted you last night… " Jesse said shyly. "I couldn't find your name on LINE, I thought you weren't using it. So I texted you by message. But I still don't get any answer, I wonder whether you had read it and forgotten it or you just ignored it. I-... Or you feel like I…." Jesse had stopped his words after he saw Taiga's hand waved under his face. He raised his head and saw Taiga apologizing.</p><p> </p><p>"Eh?" He saw Taiga hit the table with his palm a few times, and opened his palm as if he asked Jesse to give him something. But Jesse didn't get it. And then Taiga signaled a phone using his hand, "Ah, my phone?" Jesse asked and Taiga nodded at him. Jesse handed him his own phone and waited for him. He looked like he was scanning something on Jesse's phone, and then he gave it back to Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse, who had been confused, was now surprised when he saw Taiga's name had appeared on the notification bar. He clicked it and opened the text that came on his LINE.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> I'm sorry… </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I didn't mean to make you feel like that.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I didn't give my real number to your friend…  </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at him with his wide eyes. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> It wasn't my number. I don't even know if the number was available or not. That's why you couldn't find me on your LINE contact…  </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse raised his head and saw Taiga pushed his lips together. Jesse could say Taiga was being honest by seeing his eyes. There was guilt inside it. Jesse didn't mind it though. He felt grateful instead because it meant that Taiga didn't ignore him. But he wanted to know why he gave the wrong number to Juri. So he asked him by texting. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Your friend looked like he was flirting with me. I don't like it.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> So I gave him the wrong number.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I did think he was just using you as the reason. I didn't expect that you were really texting me… </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I'm so sorry…  </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse couldn't hide his laughter. He found it was so funny when he heard that Juri was the reason Taiga gave him the wrong number. It was the first time he heard someone thought Juri looked like a playboy who loved flirting. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse shook his head and started typing again on his phone.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> That's fine! </em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em> I'm happy to know that you didn't ignore me, hehe. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at Taiga who smiled shyly at him. He saw him saying thank you and bowed again. There was a silence between them as Jesse thought about something. He had been gone this far, so he would ask Taiga again.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Are you free tonight? </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at Taiga shyly as he waited for his answer.</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> I guess so. Why? </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse bit his lower lips and started typing again.</p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Do you want to go with me?  </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Jesse raised his head and saw Taiga looked surprised at him. He asked him directly where they would go and Jesse answered him by moving his hand, signaling that they would go for dinner. It looked like Taiga was hesitant about it, but then he nodded. Jesse couldn't hide his happiness as he grinned at him. </p><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em> Okay, I will pick you up tonight. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>He looked at Taiga and saw him nodding and smiled at him</p><p> </p><p>Jesse felt like happiness had been flooded inside him. He bid him goodbye and waved at him until he walked out of the shop. He couldn't stop smiling, his heart beating so fast, and his face was getting red. He couldn't wait until tonight. He had to make sure that he would dress well and brought Taiga to the best restaurant he ever knew. </p>
