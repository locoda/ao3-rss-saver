  <em>"If you really meant what you said, then show us! I’ll throw everything in here and start over just for you,"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>All went well at the beginning. Hokuto was raised in a very good environment, with supportive parents, and a loving family. Being the youngest son in the family makes him pampered and well-fed. He complains about nothing as he always looks up to his family. He adores the fact that he would undoubtedly be the type of married couple who is still holding hands wherever they go. And his sincere brother has always been his role model for being sincere towards everything. </p><p> </p><p>He thinks the world will support him as well, but it turned bottom side up as he finally stepped into the world he used to hold in admiration.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Hey, congrats, dude! I heard you guys were promoted!" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Sorry, what?"  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto learned his first bitter pill when he was just around his second year in the industry. People congratulate him, but he heard nothing about it. People also shut their mouths as they had just spilled the tea before Hokuto was informed. But in the end, the big cheese has never come to him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> "Sorry, man… I thought you'd go to the next level with them. You guys are always on the same team,"  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto vividly remembered how it feels to be defeated. He sensed betrayal, but he could do nothing as he was not the one who made the decisions. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s just not your time. They’ll come after you when the time is right… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>All the affirmation they gave makes Hokuto’s hope float. He was confident that the next time he'd go after them, he'd be on the same team as the people he knew best.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t want to feel defeated and live under their shadows just because he couldn’t catch up with them. However, the feeling of being underestimated while no one faced him as such caused him to have an attitude.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey! How’d you do?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm," </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s jealousy mixed with his misery made him unable to control how he should face people. He could just have a talk-to-my-hand attitude every time his ex-teammate reached out to see how he was doing. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’ll definitely be after you, and we’ll meet again at the same level with two totally different teams… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His relationship with his ex-teammate was shattered. Hokuto’s pride was all hell broken, and every nice word that came from whoever flew away leaving him hurt him the most. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why is it so hard to live outside? What was that all-loving atmosphere I had in my home environment? Where’s the reality? Am I living in my own wonderland?  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Why is it so hard for people to accept me? What am I lacking?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Day by day, Hokuto saw people grow, but he felt he still stood in the same place. No matter how he stretched his hand, he couldn’t reach them. Every improvement he saw from people that used to be on the same team made him feel like he was such a piece of shit. Useless and no one was looking for him. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto isolates himself in his shell and tells everyone to fuck off while he tries to deal with his shit—which is never ironed out if he continues to act in that manner<span>—</span>.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s lack of credibility made it difficult for him to make friends. His first betrayal–or that was what he thought—was enough for him to not get too attached to someone outside the family. He let people see him as a mystery, with a cold attitude, and as someone who was difficult to reach, while he was actually just trying to protect himself. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, I heard you landed four contracts this year! Congratulations, dude!"</p><p> </p><p>As a result of his jealousy and disappointments, Hokuto's enhancements grew to a significant level. He wolves out <em> every  </em>offer and promotion he got and he’s on a grand scale to reach the top. He was aware that there were so many ways to skin a cat, and he couldn’t just sit still and blame everything continuously. However, the salutations people gave to his big cheese never got through to his heart. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s not enough… It’s still not enough… </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, this is Morimoto and Lewis," </p><p> </p><p>"I’m Morimoto Shintaro,"</p><p> </p><p>"I’m Lewis Jesse. Just call me Jesse,"</p><p> </p><p>There was a time when Hokuto was finally united with some people who entered the industry earlier than him. Seeing himself paired with seniors who were younger than him caused him consternation. He instantly lost his ambition to make a breakthrough when he knew who would be joining. </p><p> </p><p>All of them were the lone wolves left by their flock. He knew how talented they are, but he also knew how the two of them were set apart from their group. Either they can’t be handled or they have rumors, he doesn’t really know what happened between them. Now that Jesse and Shintaro were part of his team, he couldn’t make something big but stay flat as he was collected into one class like no one could be a star. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, long time no see!" Shintaro greeted. He was one of the youngest members who made a breakthrough in his freshman year. They were never really in a team, but Shintaro knew that Hokuto was highly skilled. </p><p> </p><p>"Uh,—yeah," Hokuto replied nervously. A usual attitude he had every time he had to face a stranger<em> .  </em></p><p> </p><p>Hereupon, Hokuto was united with a group of top-notch individuals from different fields. Rumors circulated that he shouldn't get too attached to Shintaro and Jesse. Without knowing specifically what was happening, Hokuto observed them very profoundly and be the opinion that they lived on very different sides of the world. He believed that he wouldn’t fit them as if every perspective and opinion would bring them into a war of words. </p><p> </p><p>It’s hard for him to get along with his new team at the beginning. He felt like he was placed in the trash with some other dull members. Even though they were very skilled, he believed that there must be something wrong with them as they were also left by their flock. Not because he underestimated them, but because he abased himself that his value was apparently on the same level as some guys with rumors. Even when they’re together and having some conversations outside of work, he could just plug in his earphones as if he has nowhere to belong. He doesn’t want to be a part of his ‘<em> top dog </em>’ team. But as a professional, he should show how he cooperates with people for his own good in the future. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s okay… it’s okay… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s just for a while…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Every time Hokuto felt lonely, he could just tell himself that everything was going to be just for the moment. As predicted, their togetherness lasted for around one year. He gets back to his solo activity and tries so hard to not be placed in a dump anymore. He pleases everyone, he’s being a yes-man, and he works so hard that he doesn't know how to stop. </p><p> </p><p>"This is Jesse. You guys should be really good buddies,"</p><p> </p><p>"It’s been a while, Hokuto!" Jesse greeted him cheerfully. </p><p> </p><p>Another year passed, and Hokuto was paired with his old pal. The awkward moment he had was supposed to be gone until he realized Jesse was completely changed. Jesse wasn’t the kind of standout person he was back then, but as time went on, he was lost for words as if Jesse wasn’t the same moderately calm person he knew back then. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> Jesse! Come here, man! Let’s grab some lunch together! </em>"</p><p> </p><p>"<em> Jesse, what are you up to this weekend? </em>"</p><p> </p><p>"<em> Jesse-kun, could you help me to walk through this? </em>"</p><p> </p><p>The thick wall that was supposed to be gone as they shared the same moments back then was raised to the greatest level. Jesse turned out to be a star. He was known everywhere, everybody seemed to be like him, and despite his eye-catching figure, he could still find some modesty in his words. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> That Hokuto guy. It’s been years since he worked here and he never get used to us </em>,"</p><p> </p><p>There was one time that some random people from his division were talking about Hokuto behind his back. Hokuto was just about to take a cup of coffee, and he could just stand still overhearing what people said about him.  </p><p> </p><p><em> I know that…,  </em>he whispered to himself. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> Ugh! You’re nothing more than mine. He denied my proposal in front of everyone and knocked me down like I was a cockroach </em>," </p><p> </p><p>"<em> I wonder why the executives are keeping him </em> .  <em> What’s so special about him? </em>"</p><p> </p><p>"<em> His brains, absolutely! </em>" </p><p> </p><p>"<em> Brains over humanity? Zero for me," </em></p><p> </p><p>"<em> Hey, dumbass! If you wanna talk shit about people, consider where you do that. He heard everything </em> ," At that time, Jesse, who has no idea what Hokuto was doing outside the pantry, just came in and overheard that conversation. He tilted his head and pointed in the direction where Hokuto was standing. " <em> What’s brains over humanity? It was supposed to be our words. Do you think what you’re doing is humane? It’s not his fault if your proposal was trash, </em>"</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Jesse being so tough yet so fun made Hokuto more turbulent than before. Hokuto reminisced on how people wanted to get him down and Jesse knocked them over with an evil, harmless laugh, pointing out how tacky it was. Jesse could even spice up his sharp words with that one foolish laugh so that people wouldn’t take his shoddy words personally. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse's bravery made Hokuto see himself as a coward. Hokuto never found himself in a secure frame of mind watching people get ahead of their things. He was so afraid of being useless and looked down on by people. And now that he thought he hit the jackpot, everyone still talks about him. </p><p> </p><p>Everything was so hard when he stepped out of the house. However, he was aware that he had to pull himself together and get back to his own goal. He has to reach the top with a totally different team that absolutely gives a shit about him. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> I don't need you to do that </em>," Hokuto said flatly, rather than thanking him. He didn’t want to look like a loser more than this. </p><p> </p><p>"<em> You’re welcome </em>," but Jesse could just giggle at Hokuto's hot-cold attitude. </p><p> </p><p>But for all that, Hokuto still needs time to open his heart, even to his team, since he has been living in his Lonewolf situation for so long. </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for your hard work!" </p><p> </p><p>There’s a time when Hokuto needs space for himself. Apparently, he still couldn’t keep up with the teamwork situation, which resulted in him being in the middle of a lot of attention. He confined himself to the pantry and took a sip of hot tea while cooling down his head. At that one time, Jesse drew nearer to him to have some small talk. </p><p> </p><p>"…..what is your first name, Hokuto?" Jesse's question almost made Hokuto laugh, but he turned away because it was the most genuine thing he had heard in his current tense life.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto," he answered. Of course, Hokuto got the reaction he was expecting. "My surname is Matsumura,"</p><p> </p><p>"I didn’t know that. I mean, the boss is calling you like that, so I thought it was your surname," Jesse asserted. "Can I still call you Hokuto instead?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sure," Hokuto scoffed before shaking hands. "Matsumura Hokuto," </p><p> </p><p>"Jesse," Jesse took Hokuto’s offer.</p><p> </p><p>"You should say your name!"</p><p> </p><p>"I am! I’m Jesse!" Jesse giggled. "Shit! My recess time’s off! Catch you later, Hokuto!" </p><p> </p><p>One call from Jesse was nothing special for him. As he used to be called by his first name rather than his surname, Hokuto didn’t realize that it was how people welcomed him and accepted him in their circle. He was too focused on his own development to care about one little act. </p><p> </p><p>However, Jesse's salutation ignites his cloudy days, as if he began to consider that perhaps all of his negative thoughts about people are just how he denies the world and protects himself from being hurt. But then, the view of Jesse’s social butterfly figure made Hokuto go back to his thought that they might really be living in a different world. Jesse was kind to everyone. And Hokuto must not be an exception for him. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto! The boss called!"</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yeah! I’ll just gonna finish this first!" Hokuto chugged down his tea and walked out of the pantry with Shintaro. </p><p> </p><p>"No need to rush. He was just out for a cigarette. Maybe he’ll come back at 5," Shintaro chuckled as Hokuto choked on his own tea. ".......How’s it going with Jesse?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing particular. That is, as you can see. Everyone likes him. I used to see him here and there, with people calling his name, and his laugh seems to be all over."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah. I’m glad we’re seeing the same view," Shintaro nodded. "Please be kind to him,"</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"I mean, <em> please be kind to him, </em>" Shintaro repeated himself. "......I don’t know what kind of rumors you heard about us, but he’s been through a lot. I mean, seeing him like this is one of my admiration," </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was muddleheaded by Shintaro’s statement. He was so clueless about what kind of earth happened back then to Jesse that made Shintaro say his sentence twice on purpose. It is indeed true that Jesse was changed, but he thought that it might be just how he wasn’t used to new people like him. Hokuto suspected that Jesse was simply revealing his true self now that they had shared similar experiences for a certain amount of time. And everyone who gets in touch really well with him has known him for years. Above all, Shintaro seemed to notice that Hokuto was concerned about the rumors about him and Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>"AHAHAHAHAHA,"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse was blowing Hokuto’s mind as he gave him no clue as to what Shintaro meant. Jesse seemed so cheerful. He gets along with people so quickly, and people also show their favoritism towards him. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What kind of ‘a lot’ he had been through? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No way… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> A person like him would never understand what it really feels like to be alone…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was really envious of how Jesse could get close to everybody and catch their attention. He never kicked into his thought of how to be everyone’s favorite in the first meet. He just stays still in his line, trying not to make a problem so none of them see him as a pain in the neck. And yet, Hokuto came to underestimate Shintaro’s words. Jesse has definitely never experienced anything he considers to be heinous. Hokuto still thought that he went through the most horrible situation in the world and that no one would understand his feelings. He knew betrayal, struggle, feeling useless, and desperation to get people’s appreciation. </p><p> </p><p>"As expected, you’re doing a really good job, Lewis!"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis! Help me with this!"</p><p> </p><p>"Jesse-kun, the boss is calling,"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis, the department head asked me to pass this on to you. He said you had to finish it today,"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis, have you talked to the Director?"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis, how’s the shipment going?"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis, meeting at 15.00!"</p><p> </p><p>"Jesse! A call for you in Line 2!"</p><p> </p><p>"Lewis, here’s the revision. The Director wants this on his table before 5. Make sure you recheck it before you hand this report to him,"</p><p> </p><p>"Jesse! Mind to join drinks after work?"</p><p> </p><p>"<em> Sure! </em>"</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Something was off.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto didn’t know if Shintaro’s words were affecting his mind. Hearing Jesse’s name is already part of his daily intake as he was paired into one team at the moment. But hearing his name so frequently that he might not have time to sit still, Hokuto could just breathe heavily to feel how it would be if it was him. He never paid attention to his surroundings as he was too focused on climbing up and not falling. But now Hokuto finds that he almost cut the line and stands forward for Jesse to tell everyone that Jesse already has plenty on his plate. But Hokuto didn’t even know the right thing to do since it was a job, and he may have done the same if he was Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto never put his attention fully on Jesse. He always thought that Jesse was a sunshine that never goes down. The energy he had was second to none, and he could tell the difference whether Jesse came to the office or not just by how his division’s atmosphere was. Jesse was always fun, caring, and trustworthy. But now he gradually realized that Jesse was actually putting himself out to fulfill others' needs. He was being a yes man more than Hokuto, and he really can not sit still even for a while. Hokuto rarely saw Jesse sit tight on the stool next to him. He could imagine how exhausting it was to be Jesse, even though Jesse never seems to complain about what he got.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why doesn’t he stop for a while and get some rest? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Why is he not turning down everyone’s needs and getting the time to himself? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Do I even look like him when I’m doing my job? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His unspoken thoughts frustrated him. Hokuto wanted to talk to Jesse, but he got no chance to ask. The lively environment and the different world he lived in made Hokuto procrastinate talking, even though they are on the same team. He came to muse over who the fuck he is to tell Jesse to chill, and how people would see him if he told that half-white guy to get some time. </p><p> </p><p>"Thanks for your hard work," Jesse greeted as he caught Hokuto waiting for the elevator. The sky was already dark. There’s no one left in the office but them. Hokuto had just finished his report and presentation material for the next day, and Jesse had just gotten back from a dinner meeting outside. He seemed to have left his laptop and he got back to the office and got it back home with him. "....you still here?"</p><p> </p><p>"I just finished my presentation material for tomorrow. I don’t want to bring my job home,"</p><p> </p><p>"I see," Jesse said, nodding. "Do you have any plans after this?"</p><p> </p><p>"Nope. Why?"</p><p> </p><p>"Mind coming for some cheers?" </p><p> </p><p>One invitation from Jesse was like daybreak. Even though Hokuto was not a drinker, he noticed that he could not let this chance get away. As he was always curious about Jesse, Hokuto accepted Jesse’s invitation with no doubt while hoping that he might know Jesse a little bit better. He knew that Jesse’s kindness was not an exception for everyone, and Hokuto was glad to partake of that kindness either. </p><p> </p><p>"...........You know what? You’re really a tough one. How can you cope with everything like that when you already have plenty on your plate? I mean, you only have two hands and one body, right?" </p><p> </p><p>The izakaya they visited was crowded enough. But the two of them seemed to have a comfortable space as it didn’t create an inflexible atmosphere. So Hokuto could amplify his calm voice, and Jesse could do nothing but listen intently to what Hokuto said.</p><p> </p><p>"I feel like a fool if I can’t do everything on my own," Jesse answered bitterly, and it stunned Hokuto. "I’m not smart like you. So I thought at least I could probably do something with my body," </p><p> </p><p>"That’s not true. Everybody is expecting you. Everybody put hopes on you," </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto thought that Jesse knew nothing about struggling, feeling useless, and desperation to get people’s appreciation. The laughter he used to hear every day somehow became bitter as Jesse shared his point of view. Of course, the negative Jesse opened Hokuto's eyes wide, as if reversely bringing him a fresh breath of air. However, seeing Jesse become serene and deep in thought caused Hokuto to be the polar opposite. The gloomy face Jesse had oddly doesn’t fit him, so Hokuto makes a bid to bring Jesse’s funny face back. </p><p> </p><p>"I don’t want them to put hopes on me," Jesse confuted. </p><p> </p><p>"After all you’ve done? Why?" Hokuto seemed at sea. He didn’t understand why Jesse didn’t need people to put hope in him while Hokuto tried his best at all times to get that. </p><p> </p><p>"Because I only have two hands and one body?" Jesse chuckled as he ran away from the truth using Hokuto's words.</p><p> </p><p>"I’m serious!" </p><p> </p><p>"You just have to fulfill their expectations, and they won’t say any words to you anymore. But relying on hopes for me is a really great deal. I don’t even know what to do for tomorrow’s dinner," Jesse’s answer mixed with his dry jokes silenced Hokuto. "If I’m stupid enough and my body can't cope with everything, what else can I do then?"</p><p> </p><p>".....I’m not smart,"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a deep breath. It is true that the negative Jesse was giving him a breath of fresh air. But he doesn’t know that it would be this exhausting to keep someone’s spirit raised. The more he tried to cheer Jesse up, the more Jesse brought himself down. </p><p> </p><p>"I just need to fulfill their expectations. I need to prove to myself that they were mistaken. That’s it!" </p><p> </p><p>"What do you want to say?"</p><p> </p><p>"What do you think it is?" Jesse’s quick wit followed by his teasing laugh annoyed Hokuto. So that he decided to read the atmosphere and not ask any further. </p><p> </p><p>It always appeared as if nothing had happened. To put it simply, every eye staring at Jesse in awe was his daily intake. Every one of them thinks that Jesse always got what he wanted, including Hokuto. Jesse is so friendly, good-looking, caring, and talented. He probably put in no effort and rose to the top effortlessly, thanks to his distinct laughter and the way he drew everyone's attention with his intimacy and touch. Jesse fulfilled everybody’s wishes, and Jesse was easy to welcome at any event.</p><p> </p><p>On the contrary, Hokuto thought that he had nothing compared to Jesse. Everything he has now is the result of his hard work. The hard work he did was his special consideration to not envy other people and to concentrate on himself. Now that being said, being productive is Hokuto’s life goal for the time being. He knows really well how it feels to be useless and not expected. But looking at Jesse doing the same thing makes him look back at himself. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Do I look at him the wrong way?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto indeed wanted to be expected, but he always knew that he had no confidence to fulfill everybody’s wishes. While Jesse lowered himself as if he was nothing, Jesse was still standing at the place Hokuto couldn’t reach. He was. He always was. Jesse is not as spoiled, smooth, and sweet as he looked. And as the way he said that bold sentence, Hokuto felt Jesse had left him far behind while they were still on the same team. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto! I heard you made the new contract again! I’m so proud of you!"</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s weird.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto and Jesse were supposed to be on the same team. While they still have their own solo activities, Hokuto always feels that he works alone. He climbed so hard to be up there with Jesse, but people’s eyes said that they couldn’t be in the same place–or that’s what he thought—. </p><p> </p><p>"What happened? You didn't seem to be enjoying your victory," Jesse said, tilting his head.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing. I mean, thank you. But there’s still a lot to catch up on," Hokuto sighed. Any compliment he received did not seem to reach his heart. Hokuto still felt like an amateur while he was actually getting busier with both solo and group activities. </p><p> </p><p>"I wish you the best," Jesse said with a smile."Wanna have some meals after work?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, I'm actually not a drinker," Hokuto refused. ".....and I have to be here on the first morning,"</p><p> </p><p>"I said meals. There’s a Yakiniku restaurant I want to share with you. It’s my friend’s," Jesse repeated his words. "Anyways, I booked it for us. So I'm not going to take no for an answer!"</p><p> </p><p>"You what?"</p><p> </p><p>"Seven o’clock! At the lobby, okay?" Jesse immediately left Hokuto as a sign of his ignorance. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could just sigh at Jesse’s impulsive invitation. Jesse was indeed extremely difficult to refuse. Hokuto has no reason to refuse it either, but if he was Jesse, he might not have any courage to make that one-sided call. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~~ Lonewolf (TBC)</p>
