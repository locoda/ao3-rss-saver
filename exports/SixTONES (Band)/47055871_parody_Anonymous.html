I’ll study harder.”</p><p>But you did not, in fact, study harder. You got married.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>All little boys dream of their perfect wedding day - decked out in a dashing suit, hair perfectly coiffed, and perhaps, even a little teary-eyed in anticipation of getting married to their beloved.</p><p>So yes, Taiga had always imagined his wedding day differently. For one, he had not thought he’d start the morning tethering on the edge of a windowsill, debating his odds of surviving a fall of two floors. Surely, it wasn’t that high - humans had lived through worse. And he was desperate and foolish and feeling just the tiniest bit disposed to martyrdom. That would show his mother, for waking up one day and deciding it was time for her beautiful innocent baby boy to get hitched off to his betrothed… an arrangement that had been decided at birth, apparently.</p><p>“Oh Taiga, everyone knows about it. Your father, your aunts, your uncles, your fiance… Everyone’s expecting this marriage to happen,” she lamented, a handkerchief wiping at the dryness of her eyes.</p><p>“Except me,” he shouted, still wondering if this was a hidden prank show, still waiting for a host to pop out and scream “you’ve been PUNK’D!”</p><p>“Please Taiga, don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”</p><p>“Oh, is this hard for you, mother? Is it?” His voice got embarrassingly pitchy, but he couldn't care less. If there was one thing Taiga upheld above all else, it was the right to make his own mistakes. The right to fuck up his own life. Not giving others the honour of doing it for him.</p><p>One thing was for certain. He would not go down without a fight.</p><p>-</p><p>He went down without a fight. She was his mother after all, surely she had his best interests at heart… and a part of him still believed that this was simply an elaborate arranged marriage prank and who was he to deprive his audience of entertainment? Maybe he could make royalties off his appearance. Then he wouldn’t need to beg the university for one more chance at making it through his biology degree. No, they’d beg for him to attend, the rich, the handsome, the famous Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p>“Stand still son, you’re awfully twitchy,” the old man huffed, wrapping his measuring tape expertly around Taiga’s limbs and noting down measurements with just as much efficiency.</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, but stilled, eyeing himself in the mirror with appreciation. A little bend of the left leg to show off his assets. His audience needed to see his best angles after all.</p><p>“Taiga, for the hundredth time, you are not in a prank show,” his mother groaned from her perch, newspaper in one hand, an earl grey tea in another. “You can drop the act.”</p><p>“Mother, what is the world but a massive prank show? From which we play our parts from cradle to grave.”</p><p>“Theatre would have suited you better.”</p><p>“Yes, it would have, but you refused to pay for my tuition if I went into anything but a science, remember? Except political science, of course, it’s too, well, political, for you,” he shot back, arms waving in exasperation. Another huff from the old man.</p><p>“Your husband-to-be studied physics, dear, I wanted you to be on the same intellectual wavelength. You should be thanking me.”</p><p>The world stopped for an instant. Taiga took a deep breath.</p><p>“YOU HAVE BEEN PREPARING ME MY ENTIRE LIFE FOR THIS? WAS EVERYTHING A LIE?”</p><p>The tailor gave up and retreated. He’d make do with what he had. Just like, he supposed, his lord would have to make do with this specimen he was to soon marry.</p><p>-</p><p>“So, am I going to get to meet him?” Taiga asked, eyes wide as he took in his future home. Though “home” was doing the palace he found himself in a disservice. He had seen pictures of a French castle once, the interior all gilded and burgundy, and ivory and lush. This was almost halfway there. Maybe he could get used to this. This home was big enough that he could live out his days a hundred feet away from his husband. Then his husband would one day die of mysterious unforeseen circumstances and Taiga, the mourning widower, would inherit generations of wealth and the family dog.</p><p>“Oh mother!” He clutched her arms, “you do have my best interests at heart, after all!”</p><p>“Now, now,” she entangled herself, “go follow that maid over there. The ceremony will be an intimate affair, held in the ballroom here.”</p><p>Taiga nodded, still a little emotional over his mother’s deep-rooted affection for her only son, “When is it?”</p><p>“This afternoon.”</p><p>“You’re joking, we gave the tailor my measurements an hour ago.”</p><p>“The family wanted to expedite the process.”</p><p>Taiga nodded in understanding, “yes, he must be already very sick indeed.”</p><p>“What are you mumbling on about?”</p><p>“Nothing. No, that’s all well and good. So, when will I meet him? Or the family?”</p><p>“At the wedding, of course.”</p><p>-</p><p>The suit fit him well, a deep navy colour that complimented his pale skin. Despite his reservations, the hair and makeup artist insisted on dabbing some rouge on his lips and lining his eyes with brown. Fine, Taiga would do his part and look pretty as a picture. As long as his future husband did his, by promptly passing away after the wedding.</p><p>“Is the…” Taiga paused, realizing he had no way of referring to his husband-to-be in less than an hour, “is he… old? Or sick?”</p><p>The maid looked up from where she was tucking in the bedding.</p><p>“His lordship, sir? Oh, no, no. He is as young and healthy as a prize-winning stallion. Not to worry sir, for I daresay you shall spend many, many, many, long decades with his company.”</p><p>-</p><p>So, there he was, tethering on a windowsill. This was where he drew the line - only he got to fuck up his life by making poor choices.</p><p>“If this is a hidden prank show, reveal yourself now, or I will jump and your ratings will plummet!” He shouted, his complaints carried off into the wind.</p><p>Fuck this shit, Taiga thought to himself, closing his eyes. It was now or never. He dangled a foot off the ledge–</p><p>“Hey, hey! Don’t jump!”</p><p>Taiga opened an eye, curious that someone had spotted the runaway bride after all.</p><p>“Will you catch me?” He asked the man below.</p><p>“What? No, you’re insane! Don’t jump! Take the stairs!”</p><p>“So you won’t catch me?”</p><p>“No,” he could see the panic growing in the man’s voice, “it’s not that! Just don’t do anything crazy, there’s better ways of–”</p><p>Taiga landed right into the man’s hastily outstretched arms before the force of the fall took them both down. They tumbled for a second before Taiga landed on the side closest to the ground. He had expected that to hurt a lot more, but instead his head felt gently cushioned.</p><p>The man above him, with the gentle eyes, laughed. They were close enough that their breaths intermingled and a moment later, Taiga laughed, too. This was ridiculous, wasn’t it?</p><p>“Thank you,” he whispered once they managed to untangle. He brushed off the grass from his expensive suit - he needed to sell it on the dark market to make enough money to survive as a runaway after all. “Do you have a name? Or do I need to jump off at least 4 floors to get that out of you?”</p><p>“No more jumping off floors,” the man shook his head, though he was amused. The lifted corner of his mouth gave it away, “I’m Meguro Ren.”</p><p>“Ren, then. You can call me Taiga,” he held out his hand and they shook on it like proper gentlemen.</p><p>“So, Taiga, if I may be so forward, why the urgent need to jump out of a window?”</p><p>“To escape,” Taiga answered.</p><p>Ren looked curious, “From what?”</p><p>“My fiance.”</p><p>“Ah,” the man’s face lit up, “Well, that would be my brother, I suppose.”</p><p>Taiga smiled back, until his eyes landed on Ren's wrist, “Oh my god, you’re wearing a rolex?”</p><p>Ren followed his gaze and shook his head, “No it’s not a rolex–”</p><p>He looked up just in time to see Taiga making a mad dash towards the fence, blond hair and lithe limbs flailing in the mid-summer afternoon breeze. He smiled. Well, this was bound to be an interesting vacation after all.</p>
