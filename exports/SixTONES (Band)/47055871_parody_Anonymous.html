<div class="userstuff">
  <p>All little boys dream of their perfect wedding day - decked out in a dashing suit, hair perfectly coiffed, and perhaps, even a little teary-eyed in anticipation of getting married to their beloved.</p><p>So yes, Taiga had always imagined his wedding day differently. For one, he had not thought he’d start the morning tethering on the edge of a windowsill, debating his odds of surviving a fall of two floors. Surely, it wasn’t that high - humans had lived through worse. And he was desperate and foolish and feeling just the tiniest bit disposed to martyrdom. That would show his mother, for waking up one day and deciding it was time for her beautiful innocent baby boy to get hitched off to his betrothed… an arrangement that had been decided at birth, apparently.</p><p>“Oh Taiga, everyone knows about it. Your father, your aunts, your uncles, your fiance… Everyone’s expecting this marriage to happen,” she lamented, a handkerchief wiping at the dryness of her eyes.</p><p>“Except me,” he shouted, still wondering if this was a hidden prank show, still waiting for a host to pop out and scream “you’ve been PUNK’D!”</p><p>“Please Taiga, don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”</p><p>“Oh, is this hard for you, mother? Is it?” His voice got embarrassingly pitchy, but he couldn't care less. If there was one thing Taiga upheld above all else, it was the right to make his own mistakes. The right to fuck up his own life. Not giving others the honour of doing it for him.</p><p>One thing was for certain. He would not go down without a fight.</p><p>-</p><p>He went down without a fight. She was his mother after all, surely she had his best interests at heart… and a part of him still believed that this was simply an elaborate arranged marriage prank and who was he to deprive his audience of entertainment? Maybe he could make royalties off his appearance. Then he wouldn’t need to beg the university for one more chance at making it through his biology degree. No, they’d beg for him to attend, the rich, the handsome, the famous Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p>“Stand still son, you’re awfully twitchy,” the old man huffed, wrapping his measuring tape expertly around Taiga’s limbs and noting down measurements with just as much efficiency.</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, but stilled, eyeing himself in the mirror with appreciation. A little bend of the left leg to show off his assets. His audience needed to see his best angles after all.</p><p>“Taiga, for the hundredth time, you are not in a prank show,” his mother groaned from her perch, newspaper in one hand, an earl grey tea in another. “You can drop the act.”</p><p>“Mother, what is the world but a massive prank show? From which we play our parts from cradle to grave.”</p><p>“Theatre would have suited you better.”</p><p>“Yes, it would have, but you refused to pay for my tuition if I went into anything but a science, remember? Except political science, of course, it’s too, well, political, for you,” he shot back, arms waving in exasperation. Another huff from the old man.</p><p>“Your husband-to-be studied physics, dear, I wanted you to be on the same intellectual wavelength. You should be thanking me.”</p><p>The world stopped for an instant. Taiga took a deep breath.</p><p>“YOU HAVE BEEN PREPARING ME MY ENTIRE LIFE FOR THIS? WAS EVERYTHING A LIE?”</p><p>The tailor gave up and retreated. He’d make do with what he had. Just like, he supposed, his lord would have to make do with this specimen he was to soon marry.</p><p>-</p><p>“So, am I going to get to meet him?” Taiga asked, eyes wide as he took in his future home. Though “home” was doing the palace he found himself in a disservice. He had seen pictures of a French castle once, the interior all gilded and burgundy, and ivory and lush. This was almost halfway there. Maybe he could get used to this. This home was big enough that he could live out his days a hundred feet away from his husband. Then his husband would one day die of mysterious unforeseen circumstances and Taiga, the mourning widower, would inherit generations of wealth and the family dog.</p><p>“Oh mother!” He clutched her arms, “you do have my best interests at heart, after all!”</p><p>“Now, now,” she entangled herself, “go follow that maid over there. The ceremony will be an intimate affair, held in the ballroom here.”</p><p>Taiga nodded, still a little emotional over his mother’s deep-rooted affection for her only son, “When is it?”</p><p>“This afternoon.”</p><p>“You’re joking, we gave the tailor my measurements an hour ago.”</p><p>“The family wanted to expedite the process.”</p><p>Taiga nodded in understanding, “yes, he must be already very sick indeed.”</p><p>“What are you mumbling on about?”</p><p>“Nothing. No, that’s all well and good. So, when will I meet him? Or the family?”</p><p>“At the wedding, of course.”</p><p>-</p><p>The suit fit him well, a deep navy colour that complimented his pale skin. Despite his reservations, the hair and makeup artist insisted on dabbing some rouge on his lips and lining his eyes with brown. Fine, Taiga would do his part and look pretty as a picture. As long as his future husband did his, by promptly passing away after the wedding.</p><p>“Is the…” Taiga paused, realizing he had no way of referring to his husband-to-be in less than an hour, “is he… old? Or sick?”</p><p>The maid looked up from where she was tucking in the bedding.</p><p>“His lordship, sir? Oh, no, no. He is as young and healthy as a prize-winning stallion. Not to worry sir, for I daresay you shall spend many, many, many, long decades with his company.”</p><p>-</p><p>So, there he was, tethering on a windowsill. This was where he drew the line - only he got to fuck up his life by making poor choices.</p><p>“If this is a hidden prank show, reveal yourself now, or I will jump and your ratings will plummet!” He shouted, his complaints carried off into the wind.</p><p>Fuck this shit, Taiga thought to himself, closing his eyes. It was now or never. He dangled a foot off the ledge–</p><p>“Hey, hey! Don’t jump!”</p><p>Taiga opened an eye, curious that someone had spotted the runaway bride after all.</p><p>“Will you catch me?” He asked the man below.</p><p>“What? No, you’re insane! Don’t jump! Take the stairs!”</p><p>“So you won’t catch me?”</p><p>“No,” he could see the panic growing in the man’s voice, “it’s not that! Just don’t do anything crazy, there’s better ways of–”</p><p>Taiga landed right into the man’s hastily outstretched arms before the force of the fall took them both down. They tumbled for a second before Taiga landed on the side closest to the ground. He had expected that to hurt a lot more, but instead his head felt gently cushioned.</p><p>The man above him, with the gentle eyes, laughed. They were close enough that their breaths intermingled and a moment later, Taiga laughed, too. This was ridiculous, wasn’t it?</p><p>“Thank you,” he whispered once they managed to untangle. He brushed off the grass from his expensive suit - he needed to sell it on the dark market to make enough money to survive as a runaway after all. “Do you have a name? Or do I need to jump off at least 4 floors to get that out of you?”</p><p>“No more jumping off floors,” the man shook his head, though he was amused. The lifted corner of his mouth gave it away, “I’m Meguro Ren.”</p><p>“Ren, then. You can call me Taiga,” he held out his hand and they shook on it like proper gentlemen.</p><p>“So, Taiga, if I may be so forward, why the urgent need to jump out of a window?”</p><p>“To escape,” Taiga answered.</p><p>Ren looked curious, “From what?”</p><p>“My fiance.”</p><p>“Ah,” the man’s face lit up, “Well, that would be my brother, I suppose.”</p><p>Taiga smiled back, until his eyes landed on Ren's wrist, “Oh my god, you’re wearing a rolex?”</p><p>Ren followed his gaze and shook his head, “No it’s not a rolex–”</p><p>He looked up just in time to see Taiga making a mad dash towards the fence, blond hair and lithe limbs flailing in the mid-summer afternoon breeze. He smiled. Well, this was bound to be an interesting vacation after all.</p>

  <p>Taiga turned to the priest, droning on about health and happiness and marriage, tears welling up instantly. He sniffed prettily, dabbing at his eyes. It was all happening so quickly - for one, singular, glorious moment there, Taiga thought he had done it… He had escaped. Freedom was just one fence away. And then security descended upon him and no amount of thrashing would convince them to unhand him <i>this instance or they would be hearing from his attorney.</i></p><p>He’d been marched right into the ballroom, barely getting enough time to admire the ornate florals or lavishly dressed guests, before being deposited at the head of the altar. Out of the corner of his eye, he’d caught his mother flashing two thumbs up and so, he did what any mature yet scorned adult male would do: he stuck his tongue out at her.</p><p>The priest had reached the end of his sermon and was looking at him expectantly, “Well. Do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?”</p><p>Taiga sniffed some more, managing a nod in between. He’d Google how to poison a healthy-as-a-prize-stallion-husband without drawing suspicion later.</p><p>A warm smile adorned the priest’s face for a second before he turned to the laptop perched on the stool beside Taiga.</p><p>“And you, my lord, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?”</p><p>“Yes,” a tinny voice boomed from the speakers. Taiga swore he could hear oceanic waves in the background, “now– really– go. Signal– not great out here.”</p><p>And then silence. Taiga wailed harder as the guests broke to mingle – sure, he wanted his husband six feet under but to think the man did not even have the courtesy to show up to his <i>own</i> wedding? Was this even a legally binding marriage? Conducted over FaceTime?</p><p>“Oh wow, you look happy,” Ren materialized before him. While his appearance was glacial, the concern in his voice was apparent.</p><p>Taiga could only hiccup in response.</p><p>“I am happy, of course,” he crooned, sarcasm lacing his every word, “happily wedded to the love of my life! Who couldn’t even bother to show up by the way. A waste of makeup.”</p><p>Ren laughed, “To be fair, he wanted to make it back in time, just happened to misjudge how long sailing can actually take. And for what it’s worth, it wasn’t a waste - you look very pretty.”</p><p>“Flirting with your brother-in-law on his wedding day… What would your brother think?”</p><p>“Half-brother,” Ren corrected, as if the distinction made all the difference. Perhaps, it did - Taiga had no idea how the family dynamics worked around here.</p><p>“Maybe I should have been married to you instead,” Taiga shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe so.”</p><p>-</p><p>The rest of the day passed by unremarkably. Ren introduced Taiga to the family - the matriarch was a version of his mother, but an accomplished one. Taiga learned she had taken the family export business and turned it into a global enterprise while pregnant with her son, Ren. He also learned that his husband was from the first wife, who had passed away in childbirth. The father was a lord, so the title would go to his first son, Taiga’s husband. The mother was a shrewd businesswoman, so the business would go to her son, Taiga’s brother-in-law. Or at least that’s what Taiga deduced in the minute long conversation they had.</p><p>“Well, it was nice to meet you, child, I do hope you like it here,” Kaori Meguro was already walking away, the train of her fuchsia dress trailing behind her, “and don’t mind too much that he didn’t show up. He has a habit of not being there when you need him most.”</p><p>The mood was somber when he turned to face Ren.</p><p>“Shall we get out of here?”</p><p>Taiga smiled, for the first time all night, “As far as possible.”</p><p>-</p><p>“I said far, not a minute away!” Taiga groaned as he walked onto the rooftop. The moon was high in the sky, shining brightly, flanked by stars and constellations. It felt unfair, that the night was so glorious when he felt so wretched.</p><p>“You are the single most important person in this house today, I can’t be caught sneaking you out.”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, settling on the lone bench and drawing his knees close for warmth. He had abandoned his suit jacket at one point during the endless mingling and never managed to recover it. A moment later, he felt a blazer being draped over his shoulders.</p><p>“Are you into constellations much, Taiga?” Ren asked, moving to sit beside him.</p><p>Taiga was acutely aware of the presence beside him, the heat he radiated.</p><p>“No. They never made much sense to me,” he whispered, pointing to the smattering of stars, “it just all looks very random.”</p><p>He was about to withdraw his hand when he felt another on his, gently guiding his movements, until his fingers pointed to a particular section of the sky.</p><p>“The bright star there. The ones behind it like a tail. Do you see those Taiga?”</p><p>“Yes,” he breathed. He lied, he saw nothing but tiny, little, sparkly stars. He pulled the blazer closer to him - it smelled of jasmine and wood and grass.</p><p>Ren nodded, and when he spoke again, Taiga could have sworn he heard an aching sadness to his voice, “Yes. That’s the Big Dipper. How fitting.”</p>

  <p>It was well past midnight when Ren finally walked Taiga to his bedroom, ignoring the latter’s protests and insistence that he could <i>stay up longer and wasn’t sleepy at all.</i></p><p>Well, that was a battle lost. Arguing with Ren was like arguing with a wall, but even a wall could be more lenient, Taiga thought. He yawned, stopping midway as he realized that would basically prove Ren correct and he was too stubborn to admit defeat.</p><p>Instead his yawn turned to a sigh as they approached the door. This would be the first night he’d spend here, he realized, a bit woefully. His wedding day was over, just as suddenly as it had begun.</p><p>Ren moved first, opening the door and stepping into the threshold.</p><p>“What a gentleman,” Taiga whispered, mostly to himself, lids heavy with sleep. It was only after he’d taken five steps that he noticed his room was exceptionally… Red.</p><p>Beside him, Ren cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable as the realization dawned that this room had been very much styled as a, well, wedding night fantasy. Bouquets of fresh roses adorned every open surface, petals spread across floors and the bed, heart balloons, chocolates, wines, the works.</p><p>“Taiga, I had no idea–”</p><p>“Oh! Is this for me? It’s wonderful! I’ve never gotten roses before.”</p><p>Ren stopped and stared. Taiga didn’t seem disgusted or uneasy, instead he hopped around the room, smelling each bouquet and taking it all in with the curiosity of a kid let loose in a candy shop. Ren just watched, until Taiga stopped by his bed, poking at the mattress as if he didn’t trust it before deciding he did and promptly jumping into it.</p><p><i>He sure likes jumping into things. Or people,</i> he thought, bemused.</p><p>“This entire bed is for me? It’s so fucking huge - I’ve never had a bed this big.”</p><p>“I’m glad you like it, I should be heading out now…”</p><p>“Wait!” Taiga sat up on the bed so quickly, Ren would’ve thought he was electrocuted. He seemed nervous, as if choosing his next words carefully, “do you want to stay with me… on this bed…?”</p><p>Ren’s heart stopped. He supposed they had gotten quite comfortable over the past twelve hours, but to do this would be madness. It would go against all societal laws, familial ties, would be waging war in this very home–</p><p>“...We could use it like a trampoline. It seems very bouncy!”</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>“Ren? Do you think it’s rude of me to jump on this bed? I suppose it is your family home and it would be rude of me to–”</p><p>“No! Let’s jump on the bed.”</p><p>-</p><p>His head landed on the pillow with a soft thud as he gasped for air.</p><p>“This was fun, we should do it again sometime,” Taiga managed to say once his heartbeat evened out.</p><p>“Hmmm? Yeah, we should,” Ren responded, setting a pillow up against the headboard before leaning back. He was less physically winded but just as tired; having to entertain his brother-in-law was proving to be more demanding than he could have anticipated.</p><p>“It’s funny,” he said after a moment, the thought having been on his mind for a while, “that you agreed to this marriage so easily.”</p><p>He had meant it to be a light-hearted quip, but he could feel Taiga’s mood darken. The mirth disappeared from his golden brown eyes, and Ren knew then that he had overstepped.</p><p>“It felt like I had no choice. Why is this whole family so obsessed with me, anyways?” He asked, his tone dry, “Why me? Why was it so important that I be married to him?”</p><p>“You really don’t know?”</p><p>“You think my mother would have explained such things to me?”</p><p>“Well… Yes,” Ren sighed. No wonder Taiga seemed so restless, so lost. He was perhaps the only one who had no clue at all.</p><p>“Our father’s lineage comes from that of renowned oracles. They see things that come true. Might seem hard to believe, but we’ve served kings, presidents, and celebrities through the centuries… Our father’s gift was particularly strong. When his first son was born, he could not sleep for days because the visions were unbearable. Conveying to him that there was already someone on this earth that was meant for his son. Meant so powerfully for him that to deprive them of each other would be the ruin of both. So, he traveled across Japan until he found your parents. Only when he laid eyes on you did the visions stop. So, a promise was made and that is what brought you here.”</p><p>He turned to Taiga, who had managed to listen to the entire spiel with remarkable patience and silence, only to find the man bent over, head buried in a silk pillow, stifling laughter.</p><p>“O-Oh… Oh god, this is good,” he uttered between giggles, “This all happened because your father didn’t go see a doctor for his insomnia? Or a psychologist?” More giggles.</p><p>“I know it sounds like madness–”</p><p>“No, no, what is madness is that my mother agreed to this. When I was just a baby? And to hide it from me for my entire life… and when she sees me struggling through higher education, instead of reaching out to help, she drops me off to a house in the middle of nowhere and makes me someone else’s problem. Do you know what today just made me realize?”</p><p>A strange calm had come over Taiga by now, “I am like that first born child given up by their mother in the fairytales. I have no one.”</p><p>Ren just listened, not having the heart to correct him – to clarify that in the fairytales, the mother never wanted to give her baby up, that she fought and fought against the demon himself to ensure her child would stay her’s. But, in Taiga’s case, there was no mother who fought for him.</p><p>-</p><p>It was two in the morning when Ren finally slipped out of the room, the day having taken a toll on him. The pair had spent the rest of the night chatting while preparing for bed. In between brushing their teeth (Ren would have to replace his brother’s new brush later), he learned that Taiga was an only child, his parents having divorced when he was only seven. So, he felt truly indebted to his mother, for being the parent who stayed, who worked an assortment of menial jobs to ensure he was well-fed, clothed, and never left wanting for anything. She herself had grown up in wealth that disappeared overnight when her own father filed for bankruptcy and then abandoned his children and wife without so much as a goodbye. She retained those fanciful habits she’d grown up with, even while barely scraping together a living as an adult.</p><p>“Which is why I wanted to be the smart STEM kid who would make a shit ton of money, so she’d never have to work again,” he mumbled, toothbrush in mouth. “But as it turns out, I am very, very, dumb.”</p><p>Ren sat on the toilet seat while Taiga showered, piecing together the rest of the story over the roaring of the water. Taiga struggled throughout university, not having the aptitude for sciences or the skill for standardized examinations. The more he tried, the worst he failed, flunking out of most courses by his second year. He tried again, failed, tried again, failed. He gave up trying and continued to fail, being put on academic probation and brought to the dean’s office with the simple suggestion to consider dropping out altogether.</p><p>“And so then, my mother sits me down and tells me I am going to get married – could you pass the conditioner please?”</p><p>As Taiga changed into his pajamas and settled into bed, wet strands of blond hair soaking the red silk pillows beneath (not that Ren noticed!), he finished off his tale.</p><p>“Here I am, twenty-six and a complete academic failure. You asked me earlier how I agreed to this marriage so easily, but is it truly so unimaginable? Don’t people marry for the sake of their families all the time?” He turned to Meguro, gaze curious, “Isn’t that why my husband agreed also? To fulfill a promise to his father, just as I am fulfilling a debt to my mother.”</p><p>Now here he was, heading back to his room, feeling a mixture of fervent emotions he had put aside most of his life. He knew his family to be capable of great cruelty, but to take an unknowing young man and flip his life upside down over an old, dead man’s dreams was wicked. The prophecy could go fuck itself.</p><p>He reached for his phone, dialing his assistant in Paris.</p><p>“Leo? Move my flight out to next week, please. Yes, I know it’s in four hours, but an urgent matter came up.”</p>
