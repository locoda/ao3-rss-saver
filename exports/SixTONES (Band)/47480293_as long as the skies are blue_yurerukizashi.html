    <h2 class="toc-heading">as long as the skies are blue</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Shintaro has always known Hokuto — ever since they were kids, Hokuto with his endless stacks of books, and Shintaro with his soccer ball permanently attached to his foot.</p><p>Hokuto is the quiet, thoughtful type, always with his nose buried in some novel or jotting down poetic words in his journal.</p><p>Shintaro was, and still is, a social butterfly, always ready with a smile and a joke to lighten the mood.</p><p>Their hometown doesn’t have many kids their age, so it made sense that they ended up as friends. Though Shintaro is more than two years younger, they had always been inseparable despite their differences.</p><p>Today, they are lying on the beach, its white sand warm beneath them, soaking up the sun. Hokuto is reading, naturally, lost in another world as his fingers flip through the pages.</p><p>Shintaro is supposed to be reading, too, some book Hokuto recommended, but he can’t concentrate, his eyes drawn to Hokuto instead.</p><p>Something inside him shifts as he watches Hokuto. The sun rays reflect off his glasses, partially hiding the serious expression he gets when he’s absorbed in a story. His black hair flutters in the gentle sea breeze, and Shintaro can’t help but notice how the light illuminates his face, accentuating his sharp jawline.</p><p>Shintaro realizes he’s not just looking at his friend. He’s looking at Hokuto, and he finds him … attractive.</p><p>He shakes off the thought, brushing it off as nothing more than a momentary distraction. He sits up, reaching for his portable speaker, hoping that their favorite band’s music will bring things back to normal. But even as the familiar rhythm surrounds them, Hokuto’s form is all he can see, his presence all Shintaro can feel.</p><p>“Shin, are you okay?” Hokuto looks at him, worry tingeing his voice, bringing Shintaro back to reality.</p><p>“Yeah, just … lost in thought,” he responds, averting his gaze quickly, feeling heat rise to his cheeks. Since when did he start blushing around Hokuto?</p><p>Hokuto’s gaze lingers for a moment before he returns to his book, leaving Shintaro to grapple with his strange, newfound feelings.</p><p>And as the day slips into evening, with the sun setting over the breathtakingly beautiful island, his heart pounds with a strange mix of fear and exhilaration. This is all too much, too sudden.</p><p>But he can’t deny it anymore — he has a crush on his best friend.</p><p>Their lives have been made up of shared music, laughter, and endless discussions about everything from video games to Hokuto’s favorite authors. They’ve been each other’s constants in this ever-changing world. And as they pack up their things to head home, the familiar silence between them is suddenly heavy with the weight of Shintaro’s newfound realization.</p><p>Shintaro sneaks a glance at Hokuto. He’s humming their favorite song, completely unaware of the storm raging inside him. Little does Hokuto know, everything has changed for Shintaro. It’s been a typical day, yes, but not for his heart.</p><p>For the first time in their long history of friendship, Shintaro sees Hokuto not just as his best friend, but as someone he’s genuinely attracted to. And that realization frightens and excites him more than anything else.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Spring arrives, bringing with it a burst of vibrant cherry blossoms, their soft petals falling around them as if confetti at a celebration Shintaro is not sure he’s ready for. He’s still trying to navigate this maze of strange, newfound feelings that have somehow lodged themselves in the center of his chest.</p><p>Ever since that day on the beach, Shintaro finds himself seeing Hokuto in a new light. He notices the way Hokuto’s brow furrows when he’s solving a complex math problem, how he pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose when they slip, and how his eyes light up with genuine delight when he talks about his favorite authors. Shintaro finds himself entranced by the sound of Hokuto’s laughter, the way his whole face lights up in joy.</p><p>It's terrifying and thrilling at the same time.</p><p>One evening, they find themselves at their usual spot at the beach, sharing a pair of earphones as they sit shoulder to shoulder. A new track from their favorite band has just been released, and Hokuto wanted them to listen to it together — a small tradition of theirs.</p><p>Halfway through the song, Hokuto turns to Shintaro, his eyes wide with excitement. “This is amazing, isn’t it, Shin?”</p><p>“Yeah, it is,” Shintaro says, his heart pounding in his chest. Not because of the song, but because of the way Hokuto’s excitement is infectious, making him look more attractive than ever.</p><p>For the rest of the month, Shintaro feels like he’s walking on a tightrope, balancing his normal friendship with Hokuto and the emotions that seem to be blossoming. He’s in constant fear of tripping up, of saying something that might reveal these feelings he’s still trying to understand himself.</p><p>One afternoon, while they’re eating lunch together at their classroom, Shintaro feels Hokuto’s gaze on him. “You’ve been acting a bit strange lately, Shin. Is everything okay?”</p><p>Caught off guard, Shintaro almost chokes on his rice ball. “Yeah, I’m fine,” he manages to splutter out, avoiding Hokuto’s gaze. The thought of Hokuto noticing something amiss sends waves of panic through him.</p><p>Hokuto doesn’t push further, instead nodding and going back to his food, but the worry in his eyes doesn’t completely fade.</p><p>Shintaro realizes then how important their friendship is to him and how much he fears to lose it.</p><p>Throughout the month, Shintaro grapples with the confusion and the fear that takes root in his heart, standing on the precipice of what feels like a drastic change. His feelings for Hokuto aren’t going away — if anything, they’re getting stronger.</p><p>But the fear of ruining their friendship, of losing Hokuto, keeps Shintaro silent. As the days pass by, he feels himself caught in the throes of a beautiful yet heartbreaking spring.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>June brings with it the heat of summer, the shimmering ocean around the islands now a daily temptation. It also brings Hokuto’s birthday month, and Shintaro finds himself wanting to make it special, for reasons more than just friendship.</p><p>Shintaro is trying his best to act normal around Hokuto, to keep these feelings hidden. But it’s as if he’s waging a war within himself, each shared smile, each touch, each shared silence making it all the more difficult.</p><p>One sweltering afternoon, they’re back at our spot at the beach, the sea breeze providing some respite from the heat. Hokuto is helping Shintaro with a video game strategy, his focus on the screen, completely oblivious to the internal conflict raging inside Shintaro.</p><p>Hokuto’s closeness makes Shintaro’s heart race, and words form on the tip of his tongue, almost spilling out. Shintaro swallows them back, forcing a laugh instead, pointing at a ridiculous game character to distract Hokuto.</p><p>Another day, they’re at the music store, rifling through CDs of their favorite band. As Hokuto gets lost in the music samples, his face lit up with genuine joy, Shintaro’s heart clenches with a longing that’s now become all too familiar.</p><p>Shintaro wants to tell Hokuto right then and there, but the words get stuck, replaced by a lighthearted joke about one band member’s new hairstyle.</p><p>These moments of near confession happen more frequently as the days roll on. Each time, fear overpowers, forcing Shintaro to pull back, to retreat behind the walls of friendship.</p><p>Sleep proves elusive these nights. As the rest of the island sleeps, Shintaro finds himself staring at the ceiling, Hokuto occupying his thoughts. He longs for something more than friendship, yearning to break down these walls between them, but the fear of losing what they have holds him captive.</p><p>Finally, Hokuto’s birthday arrives. Shintaro decides to throw a small party for him at their favorite spot on the beach.</p><p>The setting sun, the salty sea breeze, everything feels perfect. As Hokuto walks in, surprise etched on his face, Shintaro’s heart swells.</p><p>Hokuto comes up to Shintaro, his face beaming. “This is the best birthday ever, Shin,” he says, his eyes sparkling.</p><p>“I’m glad you like it, Hokku,” Shintaro says, his voice trembling a bit.</p><p>That evening, as he blows out the candles on his cake, Shintaro makes a wish too. A wish to be brave enough to confess his feelings, to not let this fear overshadow the love that has quietly taken root in his heart.</p><p>But as Shintaro looks at Hokuto, his face glowing in the candlelight, he says nothing. The fear wins again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the calendar flips to July, Shintaro notices a shift in Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto’s always been observant, but these days it feels like his eyes are perpetually trained on Shintaro, his gaze searching, probing. He’s starting to pick up on the changes in Shintaro, the ones he’s been trying so hard to hide.</p><p>One day, while they’re at their beach spot, he hesitates before saying, “Shin, you’ve been … different lately. Is something bothering you?” His voice is full of concern, and Shintaro is taken aback by his blunt question.</p><p>Shintaro brushes it off with a shrug, forcing a laugh. “Just the heat getting to me, I guess.”</p><p>But Hokuto isn’t convinced, and Shintaro can see him mulling over his response. Hokuto’s trying to puzzle out the change, to understand why his friend has been acting so strange. Shintaro can see the confusion in his eyes, and it pains him to know he’s the cause.</p><p>On Shintaro’s sixteenth birthday, Hokuto takes him to a secluded spot on the beach. He hands Shintaro a beautifully wrapped gift. Inside is a limited edition poster of their favorite band, a gift so thoughtful that it stirs something within Shintaro. As he thanks Hokuto, his voice breaks slightly, and he catches it.</p><p>“Shin, you’re my best friend. You can talk to me about anything,” Hokuto says, his voice barely above a whisper, his gaze intense and unwavering.</p><p>There’s a part of Shintaro that wants to tell Hokuto everything in that moment, to lay bare his feelings and free himself of the weight he’s been carrying. But then, fear seizes him once more, the familiar dread of potentially losing his best friend keeps him silent.</p><p>Shintaro manages a weak smile, muttering, “I know, Hokku. Thanks.”</p><p>The month moves on, with Hokuto growing more worried and confused, and Shintaro sinking further into his shell. Hokuto’s attempts to understand his unusual behavior, his patience, and his unwavering care only makes Shintaro’s heart ache more.</p><p>Finally, on a humid afternoon, while they;re sharing a bowl of shaved ice at their favorite shop, Hokuto puts his spoon down, his expression serious.</p><p>“Shin, I can’t shake off the feeling that something’s off. You’ve been distant lately … Is it something I did?”</p><p>Hokuto’s words catch Shintaro off guard, and for a moment, he’s lost for words. Hokuto’s concern, the earnest look in his eyes, brings a lump to Shintaro throat. Here he is, madly in love with his best friend, while Hokuto’s agonizing over what he might have done wrong.</p><p>The irony isn’t lost on him.</p><p>“No, Hokuto,” Shintaro manages to say, his voice barely audible. “It’s not you. It’s … It’s me.”</p><p>And as he says those words, Shintaro realizes it’s time he confronts his feelings, time he stops hiding.</p><p>But for now, all Ihe can do is reassure Hokuto, his best friend, the boy Shintaro’s fallen for, that he’s not the one at fault.</p><p>As July comes to a close, Shintaro knows he can’t let this continue. He owes Hokuto an explanation, and he owes it to himself to be honest about his feelings.</p><p>But how he’s going to do that is a question for another day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As August rolls around, the heat of summer is relentless, matching the turmoil that churns within Shintaro. It’s the hottest month of the year, and yet, he feels like he’s the one burning, his emotions simmering just beneath the surface.</p><p>One afternoon, he and Hokuto are at their spot at the beach, the sea breeze doing little to alleviate the scorching heat. The silence between them is heavy.</p><p>Finally, Shintaro gathers up his courage. “Hokuto, there’s something I need to tell you.”</p><p>Hokuto turns to him, his eyes showing a mix of concern and anticipation. He nods, encouraging Shintaro to continue.</p><p>“I’ve been acting weird lately because … because …” Shintaro trails off, suddenly unsure. Taking a deep breath, he plunges ahead. “Because I think I’m in love with you, Hokuto.”</p><p>The words hang in the air between them. Shintaro watches as a range of emotions flash across Hokuto’s face — surprise, confusion, realization. A tense silence follows his confession, only broken by the distant sound of the sea waves.</p><p>“I don’t want this to ruin our friendship,” Shintaro rushes to add, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p>Hokuto remains silent for what feels like an eternity. When he finally speaks, his voice is low and steady. “Shin, I … I’ve felt the same way about you for a long time.”</p><p>His admission leaves Shintaro stunned. All this time, Hokuto’s felt the same way? Relief, happiness, fear — all these emotions wash over him like a tidal wave.</p><p>“Since we were kids, actually,” Hokuto adds, a faint blush coloring his cheeks. “I just didn’t know how to tell you.”</p><p>They sit there in silence, processing their mutual confessions. The tension that has been building for months starts to dissipate, replaced by a newfound understanding.</p><p>It’s scary, navigating this unfamiliar territory in their relationship. But as Shintaro looks at Hokuto, his face lit by the setting sun, he feels a surge of hope. They’ve been through so much together, weathered so many storms as friends.</p><p>As Shintaro reaches out to squeeze his hand, Hokuto squeezes back, a silent promise that no matter what, they’ll weather this too.</p><p>August comes with a wave of heat and a whirlwind of emotions. Shintaro’s confession, Hokuto’s admission, it all feels like a dream. But as Shintaro sees the understanding in Hokuto’s eyes, he knows it’s not a dream.</p><p>It’s a new reality, their reality.</p><p>As the summer sun blazes down on them, Shintaro realizes that confessing his feelings to Hokuto is the best decision he’s made. It feels like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders. The fear of losing his best friend still lingers, but knowing he feels the same way brings a sense of hope.</p><p>He and Hokuto have a lot to figure out. But right now, as they sit together under the vast, cloudless sky, everything feels just right.</p><p>For the first time in months, Shintaro finds himself looking forward to what the future holds, to exploring this new side of their relationship.</p><p>As the sun begins to set, casting long shadows on the beach, Shintaro turns to Hokuto, a newfound determination in his heart. “Let’s figure this out, together,” he says.</p><p>Hokuto nods, squeezing Shintaro’s hand tighter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The days bleed into moments marked by the unpredictable whims of typhoon season. Just like the weather, the transition from being best friends to something more is a rollercoaster of emotions for Shintaro and Hokuto.</p><p>One moment, they’re their usual selves, bickering over video games or discussing their favorite songs. The next, they’re navigating this new territory, tiptoeing around each other with a strange mix of shyness and anticipation.</p><p>One afternoon, as they sit huddled in Hokuto’s room, the sound of the typhoon’s fury muffled behind the closed windows, they decide it’s time to have ‘The Talk.’</p><p>“Shin, what does this mean for us?” Hokuto asks, his voice steady despite the hint of uncertainty in his eyes.</p><p>Shintaro takes a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. “It means … it means we’re more than friends, Hokuto.”</p><p>“But how do we do this? How do we … navigate?” Hokuto asks, his words mirroring his own fears.</p><p>“Maybe we just … try?” Shintaro suggests. “We give this a chance, see where it takes us. We don’t have to have all the answers, Hokuto.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, mulling over Shintaro’s words. After a moment, he agrees. “Let’s try, then. Despite the risks.”</p><p>There’s a tangible shift in the air around them, a silent acknowledgment of the path we're choosing to take. The initial few days are awkward, the air between them thick with uncertainty. They fumble and stutter around each other, the ease of their years-long friendship seemingly replaced by unfamiliar tension.</p><p>But then, one evening, as they’re sitting by the beach, watching the sun set after a day-long typhoon, Hokuto takes Shintaro’s hand in his, his fingers gently intertwining with his. It’s a small gesture, but one that feels like a breakthrough.</p><p>From that moment, the awkwardness starts to recede, replaced by the comfort of their established bond. They’re still learning, still navigating this new relationship, but every shared smile, every hand held, every whispered conversation under the stars, reassures them that they’re on the right path.</p><p>As the typhoon season draws to a close, Shintaro looks at Hokuto, his face illuminated by the soft glow of the setting sun, and he feels a surge of affection for him. Yes, their friendship has changed, evolved into something more. But at the core, they’re still them — Shintaro and Hokuto, two boys trying to figure out life, love, and everything in between.</p><p>And for now, that's enough.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🖤💚</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As the calendar flips to October, the weather on the island becomes more stable. It’s hot on some days, mild on others, a mirror of the ebb and flow of emotions between Shintaro and Hokuto. As the month progresses, they continue to navigate their way around this new relationship, finding solace in the familiar yet thrilling dynamics of being officially together.</p><p>One day, under the warm sun, Hokuto asks, “Are we … are we dating, Shin?”</p><p>Shintaro can’t help but laugh at his serious tone. “What do you think we’ve been doing, Hokku?” he teases.</p><p>Hokuto blushes, his cheeks turning a delightful shade of pink, and Shintaro’s suddenly struck by how lucky he is to have him.</p><p>“Yes,” Shintaro adds, softening his tone. “We’re dating.”</p><p>The admission brings a sweet sort of happiness. It’s official. They’re no longer just best friends. They’re a couple.</p><p>With each passing day, they continue to strengthen their bond, their shared history forming the strong foundation upon which they’re building this new chapter of their lives. They promise each other to always cherish and respect their relationship, a pledge sealed with a tentative, then increasingly confident, kiss.</p><p>Underneath the brilliance of the sun, their shared smiles speak of a promise kept, a friendship evolved into something more profound, something beautiful. There are still uncertainties, still fears lurking in the corners of their minds, but they’re eclipsed by the trust and love that continue to bloom between them.</p><p>In the quiet moments, when it’s just Shintaro and Hokuto under the vast, open sky, Shintaro finds himself reflecting on their journey. From childhood friends to teenagers navigating the complex world of emotions and now, as a couple, each chapter of their story has been filled with memories, laughter, tears, and, most importantly, each other.</p><p>As the month draws to a close, Shintaro and Hokuto find themselves back at the beach, the place that has witnessed the evolution of their friendship. The setting sun paints the sky in shades of orange and purple, a serene backdrop to our quiet companionship.</p><p>“Here’s to us, Hokuto,” Shintaro says, pulling Hokuto close in an embrace. “And to whatever comes next.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles, his eyes reflecting the twilight hues. “To us, Shin. No matter what.”</p><p>As they seal their promise with a gentle kiss, Shintaro can’t help but feel a sense of contentment.</p><p>Yes, they have a long journey ahead.</p><p>Yes, there will be challenges.</p><p>But as Shintaro stands here, with Hokuto by his side, he knows they’re ready for it.</p><p align="center">
