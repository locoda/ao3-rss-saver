<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">
<span>🖤</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Guten Abend."</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>"</span>
</em>
<span>I'm Hokuto Matsumura.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The clapping sounds of the excited audience filled the theater. Hokuto bowed a bit longer as he tried to hide his flushed cheeks and his wide smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He just finished the first tour of their new album in Osaka and Hokuto had a flight to Berlin to attend a film festival to promote his new movie with his co-star, Mone Kamishiraishi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't his first time to be invited to Berlinale, but Hokuto couldn't come back then. He just got a chance to go this time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wasn't lying that he was afraid of the cold reaction he would receive, but they introduced him as Shouta, the boy who turned into a chair in his previous movie and seeing how enthusiasm filled the theater room gave more confidence for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hundreds of smiles shone brightly over the room. The theater which was filled with the sound of sobbing was now replaced by loud and warm clapping hands that filled Hokuto's ears and his heart. Such the best reaction that he got from the audience as the film that was played had finished, he thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The warmth smile that he saw from the staff and his co-star, Mone, was also the reason for the increase of warmth within himself. Hokuto felt grateful that he could go to this country and was warmly welcomed by them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even though their manager had to reschedule all their tour dates and Hokuto had to swallow hard his uncomfortable feelings for being a burden to his group. But seeing their happy faces when he told them that he would go, it erased the uneasy feelings within him.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Guys, I will go to Berlin tomorrow." Hokuto told them while smiling shyly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Eeeh so you will really go? Uwaah that's unfair!!” Shintaro whined about how he couldn't go with him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm so happy for you, Hokuto. You finally will be able to go." Kochi gave a pat on his shoulder as he smiled warmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Hokuto. Do you want some recommendations of food? I can give you some and I also have some friends who live there and maybe they could help you." Jesse butting in as he walked closer while drying his hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh? Friends?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto, who was not good at socializing, didn't think that he could go out with Jesse’s friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How long will you be there, Hokuto?" Juri came in with a cup of coffee in his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Just a few days."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The buzz of their voices filled the room as Shintaro started another whine by requesting a sudden wish to go together with him. Hokuto merely smiled as he watched how excited they were to watch him later. His lips lifted in warmth, wishing the same for them to go together or at least, they would have some spare time to watch him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And there he was, Kyomoto Taiga, sitting alone with his phone in his palm. The stuff he had scattered around him; his camera, bag, clothes, even his socks, as if the seat was only his. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kyomoto Taiga was there, watching the rest like he used to, merely smiling without saying anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Hokuto told them about this, Taiga only smiled and clapped his hands calmly like the others. Hokuto didn't really look at him as he did find it would be awkward. But his eyes caught a slight disappointment within Taiga's eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Taiga look disappointed? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto remembered how happy Taiga was when he told them that he got invited again to Berlinale. Even though he still didn't know if he could go or not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Hokuto remembered how sparkling Taiga's eyes were. He even congratulated him for that. Not exactly like the other did though, when they patted his shoulder or gave him a big hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was just there, smiling brightly and warmly that Hokuto could feel it within his heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this time, Taiga didn't say anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His smile also looked different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no big smile, there was no warmth in his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It looked… sad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked sad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto couldn't make sure if he was mistaken or what. He didn't know if it was just his brain fooled him. He didn't know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He couldn't tell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But he knew that it hurt him… a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Matsumura-san, congratulations!! How does it feel to be able to come here to promote your new movie and greet your fans? You weren't able to come last year, but now you're here with us." The man in a black suit who stood next to him distracted Hokuto from his own thoughts. Hokuto smiled warmly as he tried to wash away his mind about Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>More likely, about how Taiga looked at him that time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I couldn't come last year but now I'm able to be here. I feel delighted and seeing how good their reaction after the film finished really touched my heart. I'm happy I'm able to see them.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The buzz of excitement filled his ears. Hokuto smiled brightly as he faced the audience. The light shone brightly towards him and the clicking sound of cameras all over the place. Hokuto turned his eyes to all of them, one by one, giving the best smile while waving at them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the cheering went louder, Hokuto turned his eyes to look into the one camera in the corner of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The spotlight shone too bright towards him and Hokuto's vision went white for a moment. He turned his eyes the other way. But then the voice of the MC speaking next to him became unheard when his eyes caught someone standing across from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The figure of someone who felt so familiar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just by a quick look, Hokuto knew he looked tall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>…Wait, how could he be sure that it was “he"?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It could be "she”, but why did Hokuto think it was "he”?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The photographer wore a black overcoat and a black hat, standing directly opposite him with a face half covered by camera, but Hokuto knew it was “him". </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto's breath seemed to stop when his eyes accidentally met him as he lowered the camera away from his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It only happened in a brief moment before the photographer lowered his face and walked away from Hokuto’s sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without him realizing, Hokuto let his eyes follow him until the doorway. His ears filled with the sound of his own heart beating. Heat started to spread over his face and caused a flush on Hokuto’s cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't him, was it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was probably just Hokuto’s mind trying to fool him by thinking that it was </span>
<em>
<span>him.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It really looked like him, but it couldn't be him. Hokuto had to convince himself many times that it wasn't him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It could never be him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It could never be Kyomoto Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no way he could have just seen Kyomoto Taiga in Berlin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Promptly his mind tried to fool him as he kept thinking about Taiga almost all the time. His mind kept leading him to Taiga when he went to have some food with Mone and other staff yesterday. His mind kept leading him to Taiga when he saw some artistically buildings in Berlin, as if he knew that Taiga would love it. His mind kept leading him to Taiga when he arrived at this theater, imagining him seeing Taiga's face on the audience seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He kept thinking about Taiga until he had to distract himself harder so he could focus on other things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah it was just his tricky mind. He must have mistaken it. It could never be Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was just him who missed Kyomoto Taiga without him realizing.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>🩷</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Guys, I'm going to Berlin tonight."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s eyes widened as the words hit him through his ears. The phone he was holding slipped from his hand onto the floor. Taiga grabbed it fast before anyone in the room could even blink. His heart skipped a bit as he took a glance towards him, the person who just told them that he would go to Berlin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Matsumura Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was such big news when Hokuto told them for the first time that he got invited again to go to the Berlin International Film Festival. Taiga was delighted knowing it, he really was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yet he couldn't express it well as the others came and gave pats or big hugs to Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was just there, showing a wide and genuine smile while clapping his cold hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga wasn't even sure if Hokuto saw his smile, but he did feel happy for him. Taiga knew how Hokuto dedicated himself to acting and knowing that his skill was being appreciated very well by others made him happy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But when Hokuto told him for the second time that he really would go to Berlin, its news came like a bombshell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga couldn't even react when Shintaro threw a joke that he wanted to go with Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga couldn't even say anything like Kochi or Jesse did to Hokuto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga couldn't even look at them when Juri came and asked how long Hokuto would visit Berlin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga couldn't even say anything as he kept his eyes on the white screen of his phone. His heart sting a bit as his mind whirled of the thoughts that Hokuto would go to Berlin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, Hokuto would just visit Berlin for work, but Taiga didn't know why his heart felt empty. The corner of his lips were down as he imagined being away with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Taiga feel this… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did he have to feel lonely when Hokuto was away from him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Weren't they always being like this? It didn't mean that Taiga was always with him 24/7. They had their own work outside of the group.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But why did Taiga feel so lonely about the fact that Hokuto would go abroad just for a few days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or maybe he did, but admitting wasn't his style so he chose to be blind for it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The corners of his lips lifted quickly when his eyes met Hokuto's and caught a soft smile on his lips. A soft and warm smile that Taiga could feel had flooded within him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But the sting in his heart that came caused Taiga to look away, afraid that he could no longer hide the little sadness gnawing within him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga couldn't even think clearly when he arrived at home. His mind whirled on the thought that Hokuto would go to Berlin. Taiga didn't know why it mattered so much. He and Hokuto were just friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Indeed their friendship was getting better, they're getting closer, almost the same as when they were young, if Taiga could say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it shouldn't have caused Taiga to feel sad when Hokuto was away from him, should it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It shouldn't have caused him to feel lonely when he didn't see him, should it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga should have thought how many times they didn't see each other, and he didn't feel lonely.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He didn't feel lonely, did he?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He did feel happy when he was alone. But the moment when they spent their time together came, he felt delighted. He did laugh a lot when he heard their silly jokes. He did feel joy whenever they were together. There were no best moments but whenever they gathered as a group. There was no doubt that Taiga felt it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And it was just Hokuto who would go abroad. It was just for a few days. They could just talk as usual on group LINE. Why did Taiga have to be sad about it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Taiga have to feel lonely when he was away from him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>… Did Taiga always feel like this?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or did it only happen this time? Did it only happen just after Taiga realized how close they were now? Did it only happen just after Taiga realized how soft Hokuto’s act towards him and how gentle Hokuto’s eyes whenever he looked at him? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn't know what to do. He couldn't even sleep well that night. He even lost his focus when they were gathering in the dressing room as his eyes kept locking on Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course he averted his own eyes whenever Hokuto looked at him. Taiga didn't want to be caught by the man he had been paying attention to from afar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Besides, Hokuto looked quite busy preparing for his flight in a couple of hours. So Taiga didn't want to bother him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But why did it sting?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did his heart sting when Hokuto didn't even say anything as he would go to Berlin tonight? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why didn't Hokuto say anything? He could just say something that could calm Taiga. Even if it was just a little joke of how he would bring them gifts or a joke he threw to Shin that he would go with him next year. Or maybe saying anything to him in person so that Taiga could spill the sentence of “have a safe flight” to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or maybe Hokuto could throw another joke by saying "I'd be happy if you guys could watch me” because Taiga would do that. He would do it even in his busy times.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Hokuto didn't say anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why didn't Hokuto say anything?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't even take a look at him after they finished the concert. Hokuto didn't even bother to ask Taiga why he became more quiet than usual. It was clear enough how Taiga acted that night, but why didn't he ask him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damnit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Taiga think about it so much? It was just a simple thing; Hokuto would go to Berlin for a few days. Why did Taiga have to be sad? Why did Taiga have to feel empty? Why did Taiga have to feel this?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga could no longer lie about a little sting inside his heart and how this thing made him a bit upset.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What would you do if I went to Berlin after you, Hokuto?” Taiga mumbled to himself as he kept his eyes on Hokuto’s back. He let out a long and deep breath before he went back to packing his bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just go."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga almost broke his neck as he heard Juri’s voice behind him, eyes widened in surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just go. I'm sure he'd be happy seeing you there." Juri spoke in a gentle tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga turned his eyes back to his bag on his hands, putting back his camera inside it as he spoke, “no, Juri. He wouldn't like it."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How did you know?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can just go there. Or shall I call your manager to reschedule your work?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Don't!” Taiga replied rapidly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another sharp and long breath escaped from his lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It would be crazy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga would be crazy if he flew to Berlin after Hokuto. What if he found out about it? Taiga couldn't bear the embarrassment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not that easy, Juri. What I'm gonna say if he finds out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Anything. You can say anything. Bring your camera, go there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga stared at his camera with brows slightly being pulled up together. He still couldn't make sure about what he wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Juri wasn't wrong. He could just come there to see Hokuto. Then left without being noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No. No he couldn't. Taiga didn't really need to go there. He didn't have any specific reason to go to Berlin. Just wanted to see Hokuto because his heart sting couldn't be a reason for him to fly to Berlin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can't."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was sure he told Juri that he didn't want to go. He was sure that he didn't need to fly to Berlin. He didn't have to embarrass himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then why are you here now?" Taiga mumbled to himself while leaning his head against the passenger seat. He couldn't even believe himself calling his manager to empty his schedule for the next three days. He couldn't even believe that he headed to the theater after having a 12 hour flight to Berlin. And the worst thing was he lost his bag in the airport and now he was still poorly dressed wearing black overcoat with a hat in his hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But who cares. Nobody knew him here. Nobody would recognize him. It would be good if people would see him as a shabby amateur photographer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I might have lost my mind…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A long sigh escaped from his lips as he cast his gaze on the road, catching the beauty of Berlin at night. The gleam of city lights he passed by made his eyes sparkle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But no matter how beautiful Berlin was at night, he still couldn't enjoy it wholeheartedly as hesitation crept in within him. His body tensed, his heart pounding loudly. He couldn't even hear the buzz of excitement inside the room theater as he stood at the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga really thought it was just his luck for being here. His flight was delayed for an hour, then he arrived at this theater just when the show had started. And it was such a big luck that he could come in after tricking the security.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn't even realize why he could trick them. Everything was happening smoothly, so smooth that it started to worry him even more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't even dare to look up at the stage nor the audience as he kept his face down while lowering his hat even more. He started regretting forgetting his mask.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His mind was too occupied with the thing that he wanted to see Hokuto…</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fine! He admitted it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no reason to hide it anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He came this far, he rescheduled his works, he lied to his manager. Everything he did just because his heart pushed him to do what he </span>
<em>
<span>actually </span>
</em>
<span>wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Taiga tied up his guts to look up as he heard the names of actors being called.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His breath seemed to stop as his eyes caught the figure of a tall man standing in the center, wearing a black suit with striped pattern and a blue handkerchief in the pocket. His wavy hair looked shiny. Taiga stood in the corner of the room but he could see how good-looking Hokuto was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Hokuto’s smile looked so bright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't hear what they had talked about on the stage as his ears filled with the sound of his pounding heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The excitement of the audience also became unheard as Taiga moved unintentionally for a few steps to the side, standing right across to Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His heart skipped even harder as he saw Hokuto looking towards him and giving a radiant smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga felt like he had stopped breathing and butterflies started filling his stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He knew how attractive Hokuto was, but this time, Hokuto looked different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He looked like a mesmerizing art that needed to be immortalized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga wanted to photograph this moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga wanted to photograph Hokuto who smiled brightly towards him. He wanted to keep Hokuto’s smile that flowed down till his heart and warmed him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And without wasting any seconds of time, Taiga clicked his camera.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was just in a few seconds but Taiga felt like his heart had burst. He didn't even realize that he had lowered his camera and gazed at Hokuto who looked stunned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Taiga's mind reacted faster than his heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He realized how his eyes met with Hokuto’s in a brief moment until Taiga averted his eyes and lowered his hat to hide his flushed cheeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I have to go,</span>
</em>
<span> Taiga thought as he walked away before Hokuto could recognize him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p>
<span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The winter wind blew softly against his face. The gleam of city lights around embellished the beauty of night. Taiga buried his face deeper into his coat as he walked under the night sky of Berlin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The street that was crowded had become quiet. Just a couple of people walked past him a few times. Taiga fished his phone in his pocket to check the time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was already midnight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga had been walking around Berlin for an hour. He was captivated by the beauty of Berlin while taking some pictures of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As he walked under the night sky with stars scattered above him, his eyes caught a wooden bench with a little garden behind it. Taiga placed his phone back in his pocket and walked towards the bench, taking a break while checking some of his pictures.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga took off his hat and kept his eyes on his camera for a while, checking a hundred of pictures he had taken with a soft smile formed on his lips. He was so occupied with his camera until he realized something tickled his feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga bent down to look at it and found a puppy with brown fluffy fur sitting under him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hnnn? Are you lost?” Taiga tried to reach it gently but his body jolted as he heard his name being called by a voice he had known. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kyomoto-kun?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His heart dropped as he faced the person who stood next to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was Mone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! It's really you, Kyomoto-kun!!" Mone smiled widely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Mone's appearance had surprised Taiga, but someone who stood behind her with the same face as him shocked him even more</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga wanted to run away but his body froze. He couldn't even say anything as Mone approached him by throwing some questions at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But none of them Taiga could answer as he kept darting his eyes around, looking for any reason — reasonable reasons. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His lips hanging loosely, camera in hand was shaking a little bit, his heart skipped faster. His body heated up as he tried to catch his own breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga felt like he wanted to disappear from the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He couldn't bear the embarrassment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He couldn't take it anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry," was the only thing he could say before he walked away, leaving them in a puzzle.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>🖤</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto couldn't even take his eyes off him, watching Taiga's back fade slowly from his sight. He didn't even hear Mone’s voice calling Taiga's name before him as everything he could hear was just his own heart beating loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto would get lost even more if Mone didn't shake his body, bringing him back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?" She asked, looking concerned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto breathed heavily as he replied, "yea… yeah I'm fine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His eyes were still staring ahead, looking for a shadow that was no longer visible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What's he doing here… ” Hokuto mumbled to himself, still bewildered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto turned his face at Mone and saw how her face looked the same as him, completely confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was Mone turned to mumble to herself as she said, “I wonder why he ran away.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you know why he ran?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought he was going to meet you here." Mone continued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s brows slightly furrowed, "no, I don't even know why he's here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s brows furrowed even more as he saw the change on Mone’s face, her jaw hanging loosely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, he didn't tell you that he's here?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He tried to adjust his straight face but his brain was whirled and baffled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ummm… Hokuto-kun, I might misunderstand it, but… I have a feeling that he’s here because of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto blinked rapidly as he was completely lost in words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I could be wrong, though. But my feelings just told me about that. I mean, judging by the way he looked at you and how he ran away as if he was getting caught for doing something bad.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But why do you think it's because of me?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He wouldn't run away if it's only me.” Mone said with a smile on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto was still unsure about what Mone told him. How could Mone say something like that just by looking at him? Or did Taiga say something to her? Did Taiga show himself to her more than what he showed to him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did Taiga really come to Berlin because of him? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But why? Why did Taiga bother to come to Berlin? Was it really because of him? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did Taiga really want to see him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>… Was it… was it because Taiga…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, stop it. There was no way Taiga went to Berlin just because of him. They're friends. They were getting closer indeed, but everything was still the same if it was only the two of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were still not really talking. They were still awkward sometimes. Even though Hokuto could never take his eyes off him, even though Hokuto’s heart thudded whenever he saw Taiga's smile. But Taiga never showed any hint of what Hokuto himself </span>
<em>
<span>hoped</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was always kind to everyone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How dare Hokuto think that Taiga might have felt the same as him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How dare Hokuto think that Taiga came to Berlin because he wanted to see him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no way Taiga did that, wasn't he? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was just Hokuto who thought it. Mone could be wrong. He himself could be wrong.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe Taiga was there because he wanted to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe he had something else to do, probably photography or just trying to find another hobby. Hokuto remembered that Taiga had visited Italy by himself and it might be the same as this time. He might just have wanted to visit Berlin because he wanted to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were no specific reasons. There was no way Taiga was here because of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no way if Taiga had the same feeling—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s mind was distracted by the vibrate of his phone. He reached it in his pocket and read the message that appeared on the white screen. </span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<span>Juri:</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Did you meet him?</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>Mone probably saw how his face looked surprised again as she tried to call him, but as Hokuto looked up, his eyes caught his manager and other staff coming towards them. Bringing some stuff as they were heading to the hotel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A little noise of them chit-chatting coming through Hokuto’s ears. But then everything was being muted as his mind whirled on something else. He didn't even know he was the one who still stood next to the bench as the others already got into the car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't even hear Mone call him a few times as his brain filled with the thing he just realized after reading the last message  he received from Juri. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, what if what Mone said was true?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if the reason Taiga looked sad was because of him too?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if the reason Taiga was being so quiet after their concert was because of him?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto wanted to know. He wanted to get the answer about things that had been bothered him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to know if everything Mone said was right. He wanted to know if what he had been guessing all this time was also right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to know if… Taiga had been feeling the same towards him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So he ran. Hokuto ran to find Taiga. His ears caught the voice of his manager calling him before it got replaced by Mone’s loud voice wishing him good luck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His eyes wandered over the places. Taiga shouldn't have been far from them unless he got in a taxi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it was already midnight in Berlin. Where did Taiga want to head off? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s feet were getting slower and his breath catched. His heartbeat echoed in his ears. Hokuto fished his phone in his pocket and looked for Taiga's name in his contact, wanting to text him as if he forgot that they never really talked in private. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But before he could do that, his body froze as his eyes caught the figure of man that he had been looking for. Standing alone across from him, taking some pictures of the gleam of lights hanging on the old buildings around him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s breath seemed to stop as his nerves tensed. His hands were shaking a little so he had to clench his phone tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga's hair danced slowly as the night breeze blew towards him. Hokuto’s heart stopped beating as Taiga lowered his camera. His glowing face glistened under the city lights. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>People said that Berlin would be more beautiful at night, but Hokuto had his own thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's beauty that he saw that night was more beautiful than anything else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His own lips drying and his heart pounding. Hokuto took a gulp and clenched his fist as he tried to gather his guts to call his name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Taiga came to Berlin just because of his hobby, not because of him, it would be fine. If Mone was wrong, it would be fine. If Taiga didn't have the same feelings as him, it would be fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto had quickly lowered his expectation to the worst when he decided to chase him tonight. His heart might break but he would be fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He just wanted to hear the truth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yeah. He just wanted to know it.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“K—Kyomoto!" </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>🩷</span>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
<span>“Kyomoto!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's eyes widened for the second time as he turned his face and met Hokuto’s figure standing after him. He didn't expect that he would be chased like this. Why did Hokuto run after him? Taiga didn't know how to face him if he came like this. His brain went blank.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kyomoto. I — ”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm sorry."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga bowed as he clutched tightly on his knees as the camera hung around his neck. His lips being pressed together and his heartbeat echoed in his ears. He had to swallow hard the embarrassment within him before he finally spoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm…” he paused, "I'm sorry for coming this way to follow you… You must think I'm such a creepy stalker for doing this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga started spilling his feelings more than he was supposed to do. Everything he said was because his heart pushed him to say it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don't know why I feel so lonely when you left without even saying anything. I didn't want to do this but at the same time, I couldn't help it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga still kept bowing as he continued, “I'm sorry I only created uncomfortable moments between us.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His heart sting even though he himself was the one who said it. He bit his lower lips as he closed his eyes, burying the shame that started gnawing at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He really liked the moment when he saw Hokuto tonight, he couldn't lie about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But he also realized he was being too reckless. He wouldn't blame Hokuto if Hokuto thought he was such a weirdo creepy person for doing this thing for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He should've thought more about Hokuto’s feelings if things like this happened. He didn't even want to think what would happen between them in the future.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The feeling of shame inside him was being replaced with pain as his mind whirled on the possibility of them might be more distance in the future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Hokuto…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I promise I won't do it anymore. I promise I won't —... ” The strength gathered inside him just in a few seconds and caused him to raise his body. The sentence that was going Taiga spilled had to be muted as Hokuto pulled his wrist and made him stumble on his feet before his lips met Hokuto’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For the third time, Taiga's eyes widened in surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What Hokuto did to him was something he never expected. His heart seemed to stop beating. The butterfly already filled his stomach and Taiga didn't think he could bear these feelings within him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was going to push him but Hokuto tightened his grip on his back, pulling him closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With brain still in haze, Taiga let himself dissolve in the warmth of Hokuto’s touch. His hand clutched on Hokuto’s coat as his eyes shut slowly. His heart pounded even louder as he felt how gentle Hokuto moved his camera aside to pull him closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their breath mingled and their heart were beating in the same melody against each other's chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't want to spoil himself by thinking that their lips felt like it had been created for each other. But he couldn't deny that it was what Taiga felt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gentleness Hokuto gave through his kiss caused Taiga's heart to melt even more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Warmth began to flow through him until it reached his cheeks, making him blush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Hokuto pulled back his lips from his, Taiga opened his eyes slowly to meet Hokuto’s. His own heart fluttered as he saw how soft Hokuto’s eyes were. Hokuto’s warm breath blew softly against his tinted pink cheeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto?" Taiga asked softly while locking his gaze at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But instead of answering, Hokuto palmed Taiga's cheeks and brought their forehead together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga palmed Hokuto’s cold hand over his cheeks as he listened to Hokuto’s soft breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Who's the one who said that he wanted to be my private photographer?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was completely forgot that he ever mentioned it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A single soft breath escaped from his parted lips as Hokuto caressed his cheek with his thumb. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And who said that I wanted to be alone here in Berlin?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Hokuto, I—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just want you to know that I can't even stop thinking about you for the whole day."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s heart burst in a way he couldn't explain. His face heated as Hokuto caressed his cheeks with his thumb. Hokuto’s soft breath against his lips brought Taiga's nerves to calm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry for making you feel alone. I saw how sad you look and I really want to talk to you, but time didn't even let me do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga took a deep breath as Hokuto pulled his forehead back. He then let out a soft breath as Hokuto tucked his hair behind his ears. And the warmth in Hokuto’s eyes seemed to penetrate Taiga's skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you for coming here for me. This really makes me happy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga thought his heart wouldn't bursted again, but after Hokuto tightened his grip on his arms and pulled him closer to be in his embrace, Taiga knew he was wrong.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He had to press his lips together, trying to hold his wide smile. But knowing how loud Hokuto’s heart was beating against his chest made Taiga not able to do it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He himself had flown to the moon. His body flooded with happiness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With cheeks blossomed in red, Taiga hooked Hokuto’s body around his arms, his chin rested on Hokuto’s wide shoulder, and let himself be carried away by the flow of happiness within him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga did feel embarrassed for doing this silly thing, chasing someone to Berlin just because he couldn't bear the loneliness within his heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But that “someone" was Hokuto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was someone Taiga admired for so long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was someone that never failed to make Taiga’s heart pound loudly as if it was going to burst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was someone that never failed to make Taiga smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And he was someone that always warmed his heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga admitted it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He admitted that he had been in love with him. He had been in love with Hokuto for so long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And he admitted that he felt delighted to come to Berlin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shall we walk?" Hokuto asked softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga nodded slowly as he bit his lower lips, still wanting to hide his grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But he failed again as Hokuto took his hand, giving a radiant smile at him and leading him to walk side by side with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was already midnight in Berlin and the weather had become colder. But Taiga didn't even feel it as Hokuto put their interlocked hands into his pocket.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto, I want to take some pictures again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Can't you just do it later?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked away as his lips formed a wide smile. He straightened his face and cleared his throat before he said, “but I want to do it. Look around, it's so beautiful here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I will show you something more beautiful than this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga almost stumbled on his feet as Hokuto pulled him closer by pulling his hand within his pocket, but Hokuto realized what he did as he asked in concern, “are you okay?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A chuckle escaped again as he replied, "I'm okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was already midnight in Berlin and Taiga felt warmth within his heart. He tightened their interlocked fingers as Hokuto smiled softly towards him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was already midnight in Berlin and they still walked side by side until their shoulders bumped against each other. The street had become quiet but Taiga’s airy laughs blended softly with the night air under the Berlin sky that night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you hungry?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga lowered his face to watch their matching steps, “I'm starving." Taiga said half-whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He kept his face down as Hokuto brushed his cheeks gently with his knuckle before he spoke, “let's eat something good."</span>
