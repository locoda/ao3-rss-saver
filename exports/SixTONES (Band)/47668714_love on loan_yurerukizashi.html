<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Laughter. That’s the first thing Taiga hears as he pushes the door open to the rooftop. The lights stringing across their old-fashioned picnic table twinkle in the chilly night, making his family gathered around the barbecue pit seem like actors in an old movie.</p><p>Taiga’s turning twenty-nine years old today, and they’re celebrating it the way they always do: with fire, with food, with family.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Taiga!” Ryosuke calls out from behind the grill, his normally serious face softened by the playful warmth of the fire.</p><p>Taiga’s older brother always finds comfort in order, in the system of things. He’s in his element here, organizing the food with the precision of a seasoned software developer. Taiga watches him flip a steak, a satisfied grin on his face. This is his joy.</p><p>Across the table, Shunsuke, the youngest of them, is talking animatedly, gesticulating wildly with a fork in one hand. He’s always been the most extroverted one, a whirlwind of ideas and ambition, even in his youth. Taiga thinks he likes the attention, the way he controls the conversation, even if it’s just about the latest mathematical proof or the clever quip he shared with his professor.</p><p>His father interrupts Shunsuke’s monologue with a hearty laugh. His voice, still strong despite his age, is a calming presence. He might be retired, but his commanding personality still seeps through. The family patriarch, still the Chief, even outside the boardroom.</p><p>His mother just watches them all, her soft eyes reflecting the joy of the gathering. She’s the quietest one here who finds beauty in these simple moments. She’s always been the heart of the Kyomoto family.</p><p>Taiga takes his seat at the table, his birthday cake before him, the flames dancing on the candles. He makes a wish, something he can’t put into words, something about time, and love, and regret. Then he blows out the candles.</p><p>After the claps and cheers and after each has gotten their slice of cake, Ryosuke brings up his upcoming wedding with Kanna. Three years they’ve been together, and Taiga can see the excitement in his eyes.</p><p>It’s infectious. It’s terrifying.</p><p>“Taiga,” Ryosuke asks, “Juri’s free on the wedding weekend, right? I need to finalize the hotel arrangements.”</p><p>Taiga freezes. Juri.</p><p>His heart clenches at the sound of his name. They broke up a month ago. Taiga hasn’t told anyone.</p><p>What does he do?</p><p>“Juri can’t make it,” Taiga lies.</p><p>The table falls silent. His parents’ disappointment is palpable. Even Shunsuke seems taken aback. An unfortunate consequence of your family loving your (ex-)boyfriend.</p><p>“Taiga,” his mother says, her voice filled with a subtle longing, “do you remember the first time Juri came to one of our family gatherings? He fit in so well, didn’t he?”</p><p>His mother, in her own quiet way, always knows what strings to pull to get what she wants. She can always make anyone feel like they have an obligation, a duty to the family. But she never does it harshly. It’s always a gentle nudge, a reminder of what’s important. It’s a trait of hers, a testament to her caring personality. But it can also be a weapon.</p><p>She brings up the past, forces Taiga to remember the good times they had, the times when everything was okay. She makes him remember that Juri isn’t just his ex, he’s family.</p><p>Then, she talks about the future. About Ryosuke’s wedding. She speaks with excitement Taiga can’t ignore, an anticipation that’s infectious. She talks about all the plans, all the preparations. And then she says, “And just think how wonderful it’ll be to have Juri there with us.”</p><p>It’s an indirect guilt trip. She’s not forcing Taiga to do anything. She’s making him want to do it. She’s painting the picture of a perfect wedding, a perfect weekend. A picture where Juri is present. And Taiga will feel guilty for even considering to ruin that image.</p><p>But the real kicker, the real guilt-inducing sentence she uses is: “I’ve been telling everyone about Juri. They’re all so excited to meet him.”</p><p>It’s a double blow. Not only is Taiga disappointing his family by not bringing Juri, he’s also disappointing the guests, the relatives, the friends who were looking forward to meeting him. The ones who had heard so much about Juri from Taiga’s mother.</p><p>She makes Taiga feel like he’s the one who’s letting everyone down. That his personal issues with Juri are inconveniencing everyone. That it’s his duty, his responsibility to bring Juri to the wedding.</p><p>She’s good, Kyomoto Hiromi. And she always knows how to make Taiga do what she wants.</p><p>Taiga stares down at his untouched food. He feels sick. “Okay,” he hears himself saying. “I’ll talk to him.”</p><p>
  <em>I’ll talk to him? What am I doing?</em>
</p><p>Taiga keeps his head down, hiding the panic that’s taking root in his chest. What is he going to do? The question echoes in his head. How does he tell them that he and Juri are over? Does he even want to tell them?</p><p>What if Juri doesn’t want to come? What if he does? What then? Can they pretend, just for one weekend?</p><p>Can Taiga pretend?</p><p>And he’s back to the silent wish he made, that silent prayer to time, to love, to regret. He closes his eyes, losing himself in the chaos of his thoughts. The laughter has died down. The lights seem dimmer. The night, colder.</p><p>What is he going to do?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sweat slides down Taiga’s spine, tracing the curve of his back. A final reminder of the sweltering heat as they sit in the over-air-conditioned community center downtown. It’s the end-of-summer party for the non-profit he’s been volunteering at — an organization focused on architectural preservation, which fits right up his alley. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But he’s always been a man of few words, content to work behind the scenes. It’s why he picked architecture. The physical manifestation of one’s thoughts, without uttering a single word.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Across the room, Tanaka Juri hovers near the punch table, looking as out of place as Taiga feels. Juri’s a second-year marketing student. They’ve crossed paths, sure. But they’ve never really talked. Not past the small talk about the weather, which feels redundant in a place where summer’s only temperament is “blistering.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why don’t you go talk to him?” Kochi Yugo, his best friend, nudges Taiga. He’s observant, that one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga shrugs. “I don’t know. What would we even talk about?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Anything.” Yugo insists, rolling his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Anything,” Taiga echoes, gaze trailing over to Juri. He’s got an artist’s soul, Taiga can tell from the way he always catches Juri sketching something on his tablet. And Taiga, knowing himself to be a pragmatic type, knows he won’t blend well with the artsy types.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But with Yugo’s push, both figurative and literal, Taiga steps towards Juri. His eyes meet his, lighting up as he smiles. “Kyomoto-senpai, right? You’re in architecture.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Taiga,” Taiga corrects, returning the smile. “And you’re Tanaka, the marketing guy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I prefer Juri,” Juri chuckles. “Maybe we need to be less formal now that we’ve worked together all summer, don’t you think?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah.” Taiga nods, finding comfort in Juri’s easygoing nature so far.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The conversation picks up from there, about classes, the heat, how ridiculous it is to wear suits in this humidity. Juri talks passionately about his latest marketing project — a campaign for a local restaurant. Taiga’s drawn in, despite himself. Juri speaks with animation and excitement that Taiga can’t help but admire. Maybe it’s Juri’s creative ideas or the way he sees possibilities everywhere. Taiga doesn’t know. But it’s contagious.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon, they’re talking about their shared love for their hometown — its blend of tradition and modernity, its cultural heritage, the food. And just like that, Taiga finds himself thinking this guy isn’t so bad. He’s got a different perspective, sure. But it’s interesting. It’s refreshing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The party winds down around them, but they remain engrossed in conversation. About cityscapes and preservation, food, music, and art. Taiga doesn’t know when they cross the line from acquaintances to friends, but it feels right. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s different, stepping out of his comfort zone, engaging with someone so different. But it’s good different.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s almost eleven in the morning, the chilly Sunday air painting his Parisian-inspired apartment in a cool palette. The playful geometries of Taiga’s apartment create a facade of elegance and extravagance, a stark contrast to the chaos bubbling inside him.</p><p>Taiga paces around, his footsteps echoing in the silence. The sleek geometric carpet beneath his feet, the angular furniture around him, they all feel too sharp, too edgy. Like they’re reminding Taiga of the sharp edges of his own reality.</p><p>The apartment is too silent, too still. It feels empty. Feels empty without Juri.</p><p>Juri. Taiga’s been turning his name over in his mind since his birthday party, like a mantra. It’s been a month since they broke up, but his name still sounds foreign to him. As if it belongs to a stranger, not to the man Taiga has loved for seven years.</p><p>How did they get here? How did it fall apart?</p><p>The dial tone resonates in the hollow space, the number on his screen too familiar. The rhythm of the tone seems to match his heartbeat, speeding up, slowing down. Taiga’s pulse quickens. What if he answers? What if he doesn’t?</p><p>Three rings. Then Juri’s voice. Deep, rumbly, it fills the room. It fills Taiga. He doesn’t realize how much he missed Juri’s voice until he heard it just now.</p><p>“Taiga? What’s up?”</p><p>Juri’s question hangs in the air. What’s up? How does Taiga even begin to answer that? He’s calling his ex to ask him to pretend to be his boyfriend again. For the sake of his family. Because he couldn’t bear to tell them the truth. That they broke up. That he messed up.</p><p>“Juri, my family wants you at Ryosuke’s wedding.”</p><p>Silence. The confusion seeps into his voice. “Why would they want me there? We broke up, Taiga.”</p><p>“I … I didn’t tell them.”</p><p>Shock. Disbelief. Annoyance. Taiga can hear it all in the silence on the other end. He can imagine Juri’s face, his expression. The way his eyebrows would furrow, the way his lips would press into a thin line.</p><p>“You didn’t tell them?” Juri sounds incredulous. Annoyed. Like he can’t believe what he’s hearing. “You’re close to your family, Taiga. You see them almost every weekend. How could you not tell them?”</p><p>Taiga can’t respond. How does he even begin to explain? He was miserable. He didn’t want to rehash the breakup. He didn’t want to admit that they were over. So he didn’t.</p><p>“Mom did her guilt-tripping, Juri,” Taiga confesses. “I couldn’t tell her. Not then.”</p><p>“I’m not going to lie to your family, Taiga.” He’s firm. Decisive. Classic Juri.</p><p>“But Ryosuke already booked the accommodations …”</p><p>Taiga can almost see Juri rolling his eyes, dismissing his argument. “Talk to your family, Taiga. Tell him we drifted apart or something.”</p><p>Drifted apart? How dare he suggest something so mundane, so trivial for their seven-year relationship. “Drifted apart” is for short-lived flings, not for what they had.</p><p>“I think I should hang up now, Taiga,” Juri says, and there’s a finality to his voice that stings. “Take care of yourself.”</p><p>The line goes dead. His voice is gone. The apartment is silent again. Too silent.</p><p>Taiga sits there, the silence pressing down on him. He thought maybe Juri missed him too. He thought maybe there was still something there. But he was wrong. Juri moved on. He was fine.</p><p>And Taiga …</p><p>Taiga’s not ready to let go. He still needs Juri in his life. He thought they’d spend the rest of their lives together. And when that didn’t happen, it feels like he’s spending the rest of his life missing Juri.</p><p>A part of Taiga knows this isn’t healthy. That he needs to move on, needs to accept the truth.</p><p>But the truth hurts. The truth is that Juri is gone. And Taiga’s not ready to face a life without him. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The world of manga has always been a refuge for Taiga. A world where everything makes sense, where the characters are dependable, where there’s always a solution.</p><p><em>Detective Conan</em> has always been his favorite ever since he was a kid. His tenacity, his intelligence, his way of figuring things out, always gives him comfort.</p><p>Taiga flips through the pages, his mind simultaneously in the world of high-stakes detective work and in the world where Juri has just left him. A world that feels so much colder, so much emptier.</p><p>His phone rings, ripping Taiga from his manga-induced tranquility. The bright screen illuminates the dark room, casting long, distorted shadows. The name on the screen is like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Juri. Why hasn’t he deleted his number yet?</p><p>There’s a sinking feeling in his stomach. Fear, dread, hope? Maybe a mix of all three. Their conversation from his morning resurfaces in his mind, the words still fresh, still stinging.</p><p>Taiga answers the call, his heart pounding in his chest. What could Juri possibly want to say now?</p><p>“I’ll do it,” Juri says.</p><p>Taiga is thrown. He can hardly remember to breathe, much less understand what he’s talking about.</p><p>“Do what?” Taiga asks, confused. Maybe it’s the hunger gnawing at him, or maybe it’s the dull ache behind his eyes from reading all day.</p><p>“I’ll pretend to be your boyfriend at the wedding,” Juri clarifies.</p><p>Taiga’s world tilts on its axis. Why would Juri agree? Why now?</p><p>“But on one condition,” Juri adds.</p><p>Taiga’s heart sinks. There’s always a condition, always a catch.</p><p>“Meet me at my office tomorrow. We’ll discuss the arrangement.”</p><p>Before Taiga can respond, Juri hangs up, leaving him staring at the blank screen of his phone, the silence of his apartment pressing in on him.</p><p>What just happened? One moment Taiga is engrossed in his manga, the next, he’s thrown back into the whirlwind that is his relationship with Juri. The raw edges of the wound that was their breakup still sting, and this new development feels like salt on those wounds.</p><p>Taiga puts his manga down, the taste of reality too bitter. His apartment, his sanctuary, feels cold, impersonal. The geometric patterns that once felt playful now feel harsh, demanding.</p><p>He’s left with his thoughts, his confusion. What does Juri’s agreement mean? What’s his condition? Why did he change his mind?</p><p>But more than that, why does it matter so much to him? They’re not together anymore. Taiga should be moving on, letting go. But every time Juri’s name lights up on his screen, every time he hears Juri’s voice, he’s pulled back in.</p><p>Is this how it’s going to be? Is this what the rest of his life looks like? Living in the shadow of what they had? Of what Taiga thought they’d have?</p><p>Tomorrow, he’ll meet Juri. They’ll discuss the arrangement. And maybe then, he’ll find some clarity.</p><p>Maybe then, Taiga can start to piece his life back together. But for now, he’s left with his thoughts, his regrets, and a phone with a name he can’t bring himself to delete.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The evening is sinking in, seeping through the large windows of Taiga’s apartment, pooling in the corners with an autumnal chill. Taiga is sitting in the middle of the living room, his gaze fixed on the labyrinthine patterns of the rug beneath him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His mind, however, is elsewhere. It’s somewhere in the past, in a time when Juri was still a part of his life. When this apartment wasn’t just an echo chamber for his solitude.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Seven years. You’d think it would be hard to sum up seven years in a few words, but it’s surprisingly easy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love. Joy. Laughter. Fights. Misunderstandings. Love again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The cycle was comforting in its predictability. Even when they fought, there was always the certainty that they’d make up, that they’d find their way back to each other.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But eventually, those certainties began to crumble.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri had always been unsure about commitment, about settling down. It was part of his charm, the allure of a free spirit that didn’t want to be caged. Taiga had always thought that with time, with love, that uncertainty would fade. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But it didn’t. If anything, it grew. It became a chasm between them, swallowing up their shared dreams, their shared future.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then one day, they were standing on the edge of that chasm, staring into its depths, and the realization hit them. They were no longer on the same path. Their roads had diverged, leading them in different directions. And no amount of love, no amount of trying, could bring them back together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So they parted ways. A quiet goodbye, tinged with a sadness that felt almost tangible. No blame, no anger. Just a heavy acceptance that sometimes, love isn’t enough. That sometimes, you have to let go of the person you love for the sake of your own happiness, for the sake of their happiness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A clean break, that’s what it was supposed to be. An amicable end to a chapter of their lives.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But is it really that easy? Can you truly sever the ties of seven years with a single conversation?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Apparently not, as Taiga has discovered.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The silence of the apartment wraps around him, a reminder of his solitude. He glances at the clock. It’s time. Time to meet Juri. Time to navigate this new territory of being … strangers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Can they do that? Can they pretend the love, the intimacy, the shared dreams were nothing more than a temporary blip in their lives?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga doesn’t know. But what he does know is that he’s not ready to let him go completely. Not yet. Maybe that’s his folly, his inability to let go. But it’s a folly he’s willing to live with, at least for now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so, he gets up, the patterns of the rug blurring into a sea of color as his focus shifts. Taiga walks towards the door, each step echoing in the silence of the apartment. As he steps out, a gust of autumn wind greets him, its cool fingers brushing against his skin, as if bidding him luck.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight, they’ll sit across from each other, navigating the spaces between the words, the pauses, the glances. It won’t be easy. It’ll be uncomfortable, awkward even. But it’s a step. A step towards acceptance, towards moving on.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And as the door of Taiga’s apartment closes behind him, he can’t help but wonder. Will they ever find our way back to each other? Or is this the beginning of a journey that leads them farther apart? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only time will tell. For now, all he can do is move forward, one step at a time.</em>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Juri is always a creature of routine. Wake up, shower, work, sleep. Except, of course, when Taiga used to coax him into those late-night excursions, those sudden breaks from the mundane monotony.</p><p>And now, even when Taiga’s not here, it seems like he still has a way of unsettling Juri’s usual rhythm.</p><p>The predawn chill nips at Juri, and he thinks of Taiga. He remembers how he used to wrap his scarf around his neck, grumbling that he was always unprepared for the weather.</p><p>Juri feels a pang of something—he’s not sure what it is. It could be regret, or maybe a longing for that which once was. What is it about breakups that turn adults into melancholic teenagers?</p><p>He shakes his head, pushing the door to Tokyo Bay Heaven open. His stomach twists, the way it does when his emotions get the better of him. But he can’t give into it, not now.</p><p>“Juri! You’re early!” Shintaro, the ever-excitable junior event planner, greets him, his signature bright smile instantly filling the room.</p><p>Juri can’t help but return it. For all his boisterousness, Shintaro has a way of easing tension. “Big day ahead,” he responds, nonchalantly shrugging his coat off. The lie tastes like bitter coffee on his tongue. He’s not here early for work. Not today.</p><p>Shintaro grins. “A breakfast date, perhaps?” His eyes spark with mischief.</p><p>“No … not exactly,” Juri hedges, his heart pounding in his chest. Does he dare confess the truth to Shintaro?</p><p>“Aw, come on, spill!” Shintaro cajoles, making a mock pleading face.</p><p>And for reasons Juri can’t entirely explain, he does.</p><p>“Taiga.” Juri lets the name hang in the air. “He asked me to … pretend. To be together, for his brother’s wedding.”</p><p>There’s silence for a beat, and then Shintaro erupts into laughter, his chuckles echoing around the empty office. “You, Tanaka Juri, are going to be Kyomoto Taiga’s pretend boyfriend?" He looks at Juri with his bright eyes twinkling.</p><p>“I know, it’s ridiculous—” Juri starts, but Shintaro cuts him off.</p><p>“No, it’s hilarious!” Shintaro says, wiping a tear from his eye. “And so very you and Taiga. You can never resist him, can you?”</p><p>Internally, Juri’s forced to agree. Taiga has always had a way of breaking down his walls. But he can’t let Shintaro know that. He can’t let anyone know that. So, he changes the subject. “Well, I asked for something in return.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Shintaro says, his grin widening even further. “Make-up sex?”</p><p>Juri’s cheeks instantly flush a bright red, and he sputters, “No, Shintaro, god—”</p><p>Shintaro cackles again, his laughter a stark contrast to the somber thoughts swirling around in Juri’s head. But he supposes that’s Shintaro—bringing light to the darkest corners of his life.</p><p>As Juri prepares for Taiga’s arrival, he can’t help but feel a sense of dread creeping over him. Seeing him for the first time after their breakup, agreeing to this absurd pretense—it all feels like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment.</p><p>
  <em>Why did I say yes? Why did I let Taiga rope me into this?</em>
</p><p><em>Because</em>, a small voice whispers in the back of his mind, <em>because you’re not over him. Because you still care. Because maybe, just maybe, you still love him</em>.</p><p>Juri shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the thoughts. Now is not the time to contemplate his complicated feelings for Kyomoto Taiga. Not when he’s about to see him, not when they’re about to dive headfirst into this mess of pretending.</p><p>He looks at Shintaro, laughing, carefree, engaged to be married to Hokuto, the love of his life. Is that what he wants? Is that what he’s scared of? Commitment? Or is it the fear of losing Taiga forever?</p><p>As the first rays of sunlight filter into the office, Juri realizes he doesn’t have the answers. He doesn’t know what he wants, what he’s scared of. All he knows is that in a few minutes, he’ll be sitting across from Taiga, discussing how they’ll pretend to be in love again, and his heart is pounding in his chest, the fear and excitement blending into one.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The campus is empty, a ghost town echoing with the resounding silence of summer vacation. Juri is there for autumn term enrollment and already feeling the weight of another year at university. It’s a monotonous rhythm—enroll, study, pass, repeat—and yet, it’s a rhythm he’s come to know well.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The last strains of the summer rain have left the world slick and shimmering. Juri always loved the rain, the way it erased everything, wiped the slate clean, offered a fresh start. It’s a sentiment that seems all too poignant as he approaches the new term, the promise of a fresh start looming large.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Suddenly, a familiar figure standing in front of the bulletin board by the dining hall catches his eye. It’s Kyomoto Taiga, the architecture major who he met at the end-of-summer party. There’s something about him that resonates within Juri, a certain familiarity that defies their brief acquaintance. A pang of nostalgia hits him as he recalls their shared laughter, their effortless conversation at the party. They clicked instantly, and for the first time in a long while, Juri felt seen, understood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hey,” Juri greets as he approaches Taiga, his voice breaking the serene silence of the empty campus.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga turns, and the spark of recognition in his eyes sends a jolt through Juri. “Juri,” he says, a slight smile playing on his lips. “Good to see you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His attention quickly turns back to the bulletin board. Juri follows his gaze and sees a flyer calling for proposals for a social impact initiative. There’s a look of intense focus on Taiga’s eyes, an excitement that Juri finds infectious.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I haven’t really done much in terms of extracurriculars,” Taiga confesses, not taking his eyes off the flyer. “Thought this might be a good opportunity.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His admission is so honest, so open, that Juri can’t help but be drawn in. He sees himself in Taiga, in his pursuit of something meaningful amidst the monotony of academia. He, too, has been yearning for something more, something to break the cycle of tedious coursework and restless nights of studying.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Without thinking, he blurts out, “We could partner up.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga turns to look at him, surprise etching across his face. “Are you sure?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri nods, a rush of adrenaline surging through him. “I’m in my second year. I should start boosting my resume, too.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A slow smile spreads across Taiga’s face, and Juri’s heart races in response. “Okay then.” He extends his hand. “Here’s to a fruitful partnership.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga’s hand is warm in Juri’s, a solid anchor amidst the whirlwind of emotions swirling inside him. Juri squeezes his hand, sealing their pact, and they shake hands.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The scent of buttery croissants and freshly brewed coffee hang heavy in the air as Juri steps into the lobby of Tokyo Bay Heaven. It’s a soothing scent, one that whispers of lazy Sundays and breakfasts in bed, but it does nothing to still the tempest brewing in his chest. He scans the room and his eyes land on a familiar figure perched on the couch.</p><p>It’s him. Taiga.</p><p>He looks beautiful, as always. His dark hair is neatly combed, his glasses perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, a picture of perfect composure.</p><p>But Juri knows better. The nervous tapping of his foot, the way he clenches and unclenches his fist, the slight tremble in his hands — all betray his nerves.</p><p>Juri swallows, his throat suddenly dry, and forces himself to move. One step, then another, until he’s standing in front of Taiga.</p><p>They stand there, the silence stretching between them, neither of them knowing what to do. Hug? Handshake? Nothing seems appropriate.</p><p>Eventually, Juri clears his throat. “Shall we?” He gestures towards the restaurant, hoping to dispel the awkward tension.</p><p>Taiga nods, and they make their way to the restaurant.</p><p>They order their food before delving into the details of their arrangement.</p><p>“I’ll agree to this … pretend boyfriend thing for the wedding,” Juri starts, his words tumbling out in a rush. “But I need your help.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. “With what?”</p><p>“The hotel is planning on building a new wing. I need help with the proposal.”</p><p>“Wait, you want me to do it for free?” Taiga asks, incredulity coloring his voice.</p><p>Juri shakes his head. “No, not for free. Consider it payment for … my inconvenience of pretending we’re still together,” he says, trying to keep his voice steady. “If it helps, if the management likes your design, I could pitch to them to have your firm take charge of the project.”</p><p>There’s a moment of silence before Taiga finally agrees. Juri lets out a sigh of relief. One hurdle crossed.</p><p>The arrival of their food provides a momentary distraction, but Juri knows they have more to discuss. “We need to set some ground rules,” he states, meeting Taiga’s gaze. “About … public displays of affection.”</p><p>Taiga nods, swallowing. “Hand-holding should be okay.”</p><p>“Hugs, too,” Juri adds, remembering the familial warmth that always permeated Taiga’s family gatherings. “Just to keep things … realistic.”</p><p>They agree to speak up if things get uncomfortable, but Juri’s next suggestion is met with resistance.</p><p>“After the wedding, you have to tell your family we broke up,” he tells Taiga. “Just make up some reason.”</p><p>Taiga’s face hardens at his words. “Why should I make up some reason when it was your fear of commitment that ended things?” he shoots back, anger flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Juri rolls his eyes, irritation gnawing at him. “And maybe things would have been different if you hadn’t suppressed your emotions all the time,” he retorts, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Silence engulfs them once again, punctuated only by the clinking of cutlery against plates. They eat in silence, both lost in their own thoughts. Juri can tell Taiga’s upset, and a part of him wants to apologize, to make things right. But he bites his tongue, unwilling to argue, especially not here.</p><p>As they finish their meal, Taiga breaks the silence. “Yugo and Jesse will be at the wedding,” he says.</p><p>Juri remembers Yugo, Taiga’s best friend, and his husband, Jesse. They’re a good couple, strong, committed.</p><p>“They know about our breakup. I’ll tell them about … this”—Taiga gestures between them—“to avoid confusion.”</p><p>Juri chuckles, the irony not lost in him. “Funny how your friends knew about the breakup immediately, but you forgot to tell your family,” he quips.</p><p>Taiga glares at him but remains silent.</p><p>The bill arrives and sparks another argument. Taiga insists on paying, citing that he roped Juri into this mess. Juri counters with his employee discount, but Taiga isn’t backing down. Eventually, they compromise. Juri will pay the bill, and Taiga will cover the gas for the wedding weekend.</p><p>And just like that, their deal is sealed. They’re going to be pretend boyfriends.</p><p>As they leave the restaurant, the morning sun streaming through the glass walls, Juri can’t help but feel a sense of foreboding. He’s agreed to a charade, a play of sorts, with the man he once loved, still loves.</p><p>And for what? A few quiet moments of solitude before the storm? The prospect both terrifies and excites Juri, a paradox he can’t quite decipher.</p><p>Juri takes one last look at Taiga before they part ways. He’s pulling on his coat, his movements careful and precise, his expression unreadable.</p><p>And Juri can’t help but think, as he watches Taiga disappear into the bustling crowd, that this might be the beginning of an end. Or maybe, just maybe, the beginning of a new start.</p><p>As Juri makes his way back to his office, a flurry of thoughts swirls in his mind. Is this the right thing to do? Will this hurt more than it helps?</p><p>Juri doesn’t have the answers. All he has is hope and a commitment to see this through. And in the end, maybe that’s all they really need.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The chill of the December evening bites into Juri’s skin as he steps into his apartment, the sudden absence of warmth accentuating the stark contrast of what was and what is. It’s a small space, minimalist in design, an expansion of himself in its simplicity. But as he stands in the threshold, all he can see is the glaring absence of Taiga’s touch.</p><p>They lived together once. Their lives entwined in a beautiful dance of love and companionship, of shared dreams and shared spaces. Taiga’s architectural expertise transformed their shared space into a haven.</p><p>But now, Juri’s apartment seems too empty, too cold. Where Taiga had placed throw pillows for comfort, Juri sees nothing but a bare couch. There is no space for their books, no spice rack from the kitchen.</p><p>Juri moves towards the box he’d brought back from Taiga’s apartment, their past bundled up in a cardboard container. His hands shake as he lifts the lid, unveiling the trove of memories contained within. Their past stares back at him, tangible reminders of moments of love, of shared laughter, of whispered promises under the cover of night.</p><p>There’s the ticket stub from their first concert together, the night they’d kissed under the winter stars. A rush of warmth floods through him, the memory still as vivid as if it were yesterday. The pounding music, the crush of bodies, his lips on Juri’s, sweet and demanding all at once.</p><p>There are other mementos too. The friendship bracelet they’d bought on our first trip together, the photo booth pictures from that Christmas market, the lucky charm Taiga had won for Juri at the local fair. Each item is a piece of their shared past, a jigsaw puzzle that no longer fits.</p><p>Juri picks up one of his hoodies, still faintly smelling of Taiga’s cologne. There are more at his place, he knows. The question is, does he ask for them back? Does Juri want them back? He buries his face into the fabric, the familiar scent triggering a fresh wave of nostalgia.</p><p>The ping of his phone pulls him from his reverie. It’s an email from Taiga.</p><p>Juri’s heart lurches as he scans through the details of the upcoming wedding weekend, which is the weekend after Christmas. The place, the dress code, the itinerary. Taiga mentions that check-in starts on Friday afternoon, but they could explore the island beforehand.</p><p>Juri replies quickly, his fingers typing out a response before he can second guess himself. He tells Taiga he’ll pick him up in the morning. He hits send and drops the phone, the reality of their upcoming charade sinking in.</p><p>The silence of the apartment is deafening as Juri sits there, his heart hammering in his chest. What has he agreed to? A weekend of pretend love, of smiles that don’t reach his eyes, of lies and half-truths. His mind is a whirlwind of questions, doubts, and fears, each thought louder and more insistent than the last.</p><p><em>Can I pull this off? Can I pretend that my heart isn’t breaking every time I look at him</em>?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The low hum of the engine is the only sound as Juri and Taiga drive through the evening, the city lights whizzing past in a blur. The silence in the car is a living thing, a tangible testament to the tension simmering between them. Juri’s fingers are clenched around the steering wheel, the knuckles white with the strain. Taiga is next to him, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery. His silence is heavy, charged, a reminder of the elephant in the room.</em>
</p><p><em>The reunion is Juri’s idea, a chance to reconnect with old classmates. Nostalgia and apprehension mix uneasily in his gut, like two ill-suited dance partners trying to find a rhythm. It has been a while since he last saw them. How much have they changed? How much has </em>he <em>changed?</em></p><p>
  <em>Juri sneaks a glance at Taiga, his profile stoic and unreadable in the dim light. Has he changed, too?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As they pull into the parking lot of the hotel, Juri’s nerves reach a crescendo. The hotel’s impressive façade, washed in the soft glow of the evening lights, does nothing to quell the butterflies in his stomach.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri kills the engine, the sudden silence ringing loud in his ears. They sit there for a moment, the tension in the air thick enough to cut with a knife.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A familiar face breaks through Juri’s apprehension as they step into the restaurant. Shota, a close friend from college, greets them with a warm smile. The sight of him is a welcome sight, a tether to a simpler past. His joy at seeing Juri and Taiga is evident in his eyes, his greeting enthusiastic and warm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shota introduces them to Meme, his fiancé.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We’ve been together for over a year now,” Meme says, his eyes glowing with happiness. “And we recently got engaged.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Engaged. The word rings in Juri’s ears, setting off a thousand alarms. It feels like a punch to the gut, a reminder of the chasm between him and Taiga.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So soon?” The words slip out before Juri can stop them. He didn’t mean for them to sound so judgmental, so … scared.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shota smiles, a knowing look in his eyes. “We knew what we wanted. Why wait?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri’s eyes find Taiga’s. His gaze is unreadable, his face a mask of composure. A question hangs between them, unspoken and unacknowledged. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He swallows hard, his throat suddenly dry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The conversation shifts then, like a ship caught in the shifting tides. Suddenly, they’re the center of attention. Questions about their relationship, about their future plans.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then the inevitable question, the one Juri has been dreading.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So when are you two tying the knot?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The silence that follows is deafening. Juri can feel Taiga’s gaze on him, his eyes boring into his.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I—we’re—” Juri stammers. “We’re not in a rush. We’re taking our time.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The tension in the room is palpable. Taiga’s face is a mask of calm, but Juri can see the hurt in his eyes. And just like that, he stands up, his chair scraping against the floor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I need some air,” he mutters, his voice tight.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then Taiga’s gone, leaving Juri sitting there, surrounded by the debris of his own securities.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri sits there, the guilt a heavy stone in his gut. He made a mess. He hurt Taiga. The realization hits him with the force of a freight train. His fear, his insecurities, his trauma—they’ve driven a wedge between them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As Juri sits there, staring at the empty seat next to him, he wonders: Has he let his past overshadow their future? His fear of turning into his parents, his fear of causing pain, has it blinded him to the possibility of happiness? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Is he going to lose Taiga because of his refusal to face his fears?</em>

  <p>Every surface, every corner of Taiga’s workplace is a constant hum of activity. An open space, enclosed by naked steelwork and a carpet of verdant green underfoot. Here, the creative minds converge and collide, giving life to the inanimate, setting the groundwork for dreams and ambitions to take form in concrete and glass.</p><p>Taiga is in the eye of the whirlwind, wedged into his own world, his own corner of carefully organized chaos. Blueprints are scattered around his desk, looking like an abstract work of art to the untrained eye. To Taiga, they are lifelines, threads weaving together the future and present, the client’s dream, and the firm’s reputation.</p><p>The ringing phone is Taiga’s siren song, pulling him back into the fray. One conversation after another, a symphony of information exchange, decisions, and confirmations. Contractors, fellow architects, the client himself – all jostling to make their voices heard, all clamoring for his attention.</p><p>The minutes morph into hours. The rest of the world shrinks into the periphery, a dim echo in the back of Taiga’s mind. His focus is laser-sharp, riveted on the task at hand. The room pulsates with energy, the air tinged with a mix of apprehension and excitement. The deadline looms ahead, casting long shadows on their collective efforts.</p><p>And then, an interruption. A fracture in Taiga’s concentration. Sayu, the receptionist with a perpetually bright smile, stands at the entrance of his cubicle. “Kyomoto-san, you have a visitor.”</p><p>A visitor? Here? Now? Taiga blinks, as if the simple act of closing and opening his eyes could wipe away the surprise. He swallows, trying to quell the annoyance bubbling up. Can’t they see they’re under pressure?</p><p>As Taiga straightens, intending to give Sayu a piece of his mind, the figure behind her comes into view. Yugo. A grin plastered on his face, his hands buried deep in the pockets of his casual attire. A stark contrast to the tailored suits and polished shoes that dominate the office landscape.</p><p>A memory stirs. Lunch. They were supposed to have lunch together. The realization stirs into him with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The plans had slipped through the cracks of his memory, buried under the avalanche of responsibilities and tasks.</p><p>Guilt churns inside Taiga, guilt and a twinge of something else. Relief? Yes, relief. A pause, a break from the cyclone of work. The mere thought is like a balm to his frayed nerves.</p><p>“Sorry, Yugo,” Taiga manages to say, managing a smile as he rubs the back of his neck in a sheepish gesture. “I completely forgot.”</p><p>Yugo’s grin widens, unfazed by his apology. “It’s fine, Taiga. I figured you’d be buried in work. But that’s why I’m here, right? To drag you out of this mess, even if just for a lunch break.”</p><p>And just like that, the tension ebbs away. For a moment, the deadlines, the client, the blueprints – they all fade into the background. Here, in the eye of the storm, an island of calm emerges.</p><p>Kochi Yugo, Taiga’s best friend, his lifeline in the chaos.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga sits across Yugo at the <em>tonkatsu</em> restaurant, the scent of fried pork cutlets wafting around them. Each bite from the tenderloin, loin, and shoulder is hot, served one piece at a time. It’s a careful, calculated ritual that allows him to appreciate every piece separately. The meat is served face-up, showing the unblemished, golden-brown crust. It’s a tactile pleasure in an otherwise tumultuous day.</p><p>Yugo fixes Taiga with a stern look, pointing with his chopsticks at Taiga’s plate. “Taiga, when was the last time you had a proper meal?”</p><p>His question is a gentle chide wrapped in concern, a typical Yugo mannerism. His tone soft, but firm enough to make Taiga squirm in his seat.</p><p>“I … I don’t know. Yesterday?” Taiga mutters, unable to meet his best friend’s gaze. It feels like a half-lie because yesterday he had leftover cake, not exactly a “proper meal.”</p><p>“And sleep?” Yugo persists. The line of questioning feels like an inquisition, each query a carefully aimed arrow.</p><p>“I … uh …” Taiga stammers. Images of his apartment, the cold, untouched bed flash in his mind. Giggle bubbles up, manifesting as a lump in his throat. He swallows it down, along with his bite of the pork cutlet. The crunch of the golden crust, the juicy interior … it feels like a reproach. The lack of appetite betrays his negligence, his self-destruction.</p><p>“I …” Taiga starts, fiddling with the chopsticks. “I’m sorry, Yugo. Juri used to … make sure I ate, slept.” The words sound foreign, a reminder of the gaping hole that Juri’s departure has left in his life. A pang of something bittersweet reverberates through him.</p><p>“Taiga, this isn’t healthy. You know that, right?” Yugo’s voice breaks through his reverie, his concern spilling into his words.</p><p>Taiga’s chest tightens. The taste of the food turns into a metallic tang. The confession. He has to tell him. “Yugo, there’s something I need to tell you.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyebrows lift, encouraging him to continue.</p><p>Taiga draws a deep breath, the words forming a lump in his throat. “I forgot to tell my family about the breakup. When they asked about Juri attending the wedding, I told them he’ll come.”</p><p>The restaurant buzzes around them, a humdrum that feels detached, alien. As if his confession has created a bubble around them. Taiga sees Yugo blink, his surprise evident.</p><p>“I asked Juri if he could … pretend. Just for Ryosuke’s wedding. He agreed, as long as I help him design a new wing for the hotel.” Taiga’s words echo between them, dropping into the silence like pebbles into a still pond. “I just thought you should know. You and Jesse are the only ones among the guest who know about the breakup.”</p><p>Yugo stares at Taiga, his expression a mix of surprise and understanding. He leans back, processing Taiga’s confession. “That’s … complicated, Taiga,” he says after a while. His eyes meet Taiga’s, a silent question hanging in the air. “Is there a part of you that’s still in denial?”</p><p>The question hangs between them, suspended in time. Taiga feels the pang again, a throb of unspoken emotions, unshed tears. “Maybe,” he confesses, his voice a mere whisper. “Seven years, Yugo. It’s not easy.”</p><p>Yugo nods, understanding flickering in his eyes. “And after the wedding? Do you think there’s a chance for you two?”</p><p>Taiga glances at his wedding ring, a silent testament to love and commitment. The memory of their vows, of Yugo and Jesse promising forever to each other, sears through him. It’s a knife to the heart, a painful reminder of what he had hoped for, dreamt about.</p><p>He sighs, shaking his head. “I don’t know, Yugo. I really don’t. But I guess … it wasn’t meant to be.”</p><p>Taiga’s voice breaks at the end, the reality of his situation sinking in. He doesn’t know what tomorrow holds. He doesn’t know if the wounds of the past month will ever heal. All he knows is that right now, he’s stuck in a tangled web of his own making, and it’s suffocating him.</p><p>Their conversation ebbs, replaced by the murmur of the restaurant. They both fall silent, lost in their own thoughts. The taste of the <em>tonkatsu</em>, once an indulgence, now feels like ash in Taiga’s mouth. And despite the heat of the meal, a cold chill runs down his spine.</p><p>This isn’t just about the wedding. This is about him, about Juri, about them.</p><p>The wound is still raw, and every word, every memory, every confession, feels like salt on it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Taiga’s apartment is an embodiment of chaos. It’s a small studio filled with drafts, blueprints, tools, and textbooks. Scale models compete for space with takeout containers and piles of unwashed clothes. It’s his sanctuary, his workspace, his battlefield — every square inch reflects a young architecture student’s life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His focus, however, is solely on the drafting table. Taiga’s hovering over it, hunched like a vulture over its prey. The glaring white paper is speckled with smudged graphite, geometrical designs for his thesis project. The room is bathed in the cold, artificial light of the desk lamp that flickers, making his shadow dance across the cluttered floor. The taste of cold coffee lingers in his mouth, a bitter reminder of hours spent in isolation, immersed in his work.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A sharp ring punctuates the drone of silence, shattering Taiga’s concentration. He glances at his phone, squinting against the sudden brightness. It’s a reminder for an online lecture. He dismisses it, pushing away the device. It’s noise, an unwanted interruption. The world outside has ceased to matter, reduced to a hazy, inconsequential blur.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then the doorbell rings.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga freezes, a sense of incredulity washing over him. Who could it be? No one visits him at this hour. Or ever, for that matter. (Unless it’s Yugo with food, but Yugo usually gives him a head’s up.) His footsteps echo in the studio as he approaches the door. He opens it, and there stands Juri. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>His heart skips a beat at the sight of Juri. His hair is slightly disheveled, his jacket unzipped revealing a comfortable sweatshirt underneath. There’s a worry in his eyes, a concern that makes Taiga’s heart twist.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Taiga,” he begins, his tone a mix of relief and concern. “You haven’t been replying to my messages. I got worried.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His words hang in the air, heavy with unspoken concern. A flush of embarrassment heats Taiga’s face. “Sorry, Juri. I … I tend to lose track of time.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His stomach chooses the precise moment to grumble, breaking the tension. Juri’s gaze softens, the corners of his mouth lifting in a tender smile. He glances past Taiga, taking in the disarray that is his studio apartment. “Let me make you something.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri disappears into the tiny kitchen area, his presence filling up the small apartment. Taiga hears the clatter of pots and pans, the hiss of something cooking. The aroma of food wafts through the room, a comforting balm to his senses.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As Juri serves the omurice, Taiga realizes how long it’s been since he’s had a decent meal. He takes a bite, the taste exploding in his mouth, and a warmth spreads through him. The sound of his chewing, the tick-tock of the wall clock, and Juri’s silent presence in the room — it’s a tableau of serenity amidst the storm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri doesn’t leave. Taiga resumes his work, comforted by his presence. The humming sound of the vacuum cleaner permeates the studio, a soothing melody amidst the symphony of Taiga’s chaos.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Taiga returns from his bathroom break, his heart swells at the sight before him. Juri is asleep on the sofa, a peaceful expression adorning his face. His breaths are steady, rhythmic, a lullaby in the silence of the studio. His hair is splayed on the cushion, a contrast to the rough fabric.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And that’s when Taiga realizes it. He’s in love with Juri.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The clarity of the revelation hits him like a punch, taking his breath away. He has been taking Juri for granted, this beautiful, caring man who stepped into his chaotic world without a second thought, who fed him and cleaned his mess, who stayed when he shut the world out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A question lingers in his heart, tugging at Taiga with each beat. How should he express what he feels? How does he put into words the emotions overwhelming him, the gratitude, the admiration, the love?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For now, though, Taiga is content with watching Juri. Watching Juri sleep, his chest rising and falling in a comforting rhythm, a silent testament to his presence in Taiga’s life. His peaceful countenance is a stark contrast to the chaos of Taiga’s world, a beacon guiding him through the storm.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And Taiga realizes, in this tiny studio apartment filled with mess and chaos, he’s found a piece of his soul he didn’t even know he was missing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In Juri, he’s found his sanctuary.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Taiga’s standing in his family’s apartment, surrounded by the familiar comfort of vintage décor and the scent of spices filling the air, the chill seeping into the cozy warmth of the apartment. There's a certain charm about winter this year — not frigid, but cold enough to make you appreciate a warm kitchen and the company of family.</p><p>Ryosuke is at the helm of the kitchen, a general leading his troops. His voice is commanding, his words concise. He’s got a knack for cooking, a skill honed over the years, a trait Taiga and Shunsuke never quite inherited.</p><p>And then there’s Shunsuke, the firecracker in their otherwise calm family. Right now, he’s alternating between helping Ryosuke and teasing Taiga, his eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>It’s a sight that Taiga would usually find comfort in, this annual Kyomoto Christmas tradition. Yet, as the room fills with laughter and the clatter of dishes, there’s a hollowness inside him, a void that gnaws at his heart.</p><p>Juri isn’t here.</p><p>“Taiga, where will you and Juri be spending Christmas?” Ryosuke’s voice slices through his thoughts, pulling him back into the present.</p><p>Taiga forces a smile onto his face, a lie ready on his lips. “At home, probably. We might go out to watch the winter illuminations.”</p><p>The lie tastes bitter, his words a hollow echo of a reality he desperately wishes for. He’ll probably spend Christmas alone, immersed in the comforting solitude of his work. But Taiga doesn’t tell them that. Can’t tell them that.</p><p>“What about you, Ryo?” Taiga asks, eager to divert the topic.</p><p>Ryosuke’s gaze softens as he mentions Kanna, his wife-to-be. They’ve only been together for three years, but it feels like they’ve known each other for a lifetime. “We’ll be spending Christmas with Kanna’s family,” he shares, a tender smile gracing his lips.</p><p>“How did you know you wanted to marry her?” Taiga finds himself asking. It’s a question he’s often pondered, a question that baffles him.</p><p>Ryosuke’s answer is simple, yet profound. “We have the same long-term goals, Taiga. And without her, I’d probably just be working all the time. She makes me want to live, not just exist.”</p><p>His words echo in Taiga’s mind, a haunting reminder of his own failed relationship. But before hecan dwell on it, Shunsuke jumps in with his youthful curiosity.</p><p>“So, are you and Juri planning to tie the knot anytime soon?”</p><p>Taiga feels like he’s been punched in the gut. His heart aches, a raw, gnawing pain. “We’re … we’re figuring stuff out,” he manages to mumble, his throat constricting around the words.</p><p>Thankfully, the arrival of their parents saves Taiga from further questioning. He excuses himself, feigning fatigue. In the quiet solitude of his room, Taiga tries to steady his pounding heart, his mind racing with thoughts of Juri.</p><p>Suddenly, his phone lights up with a new message — it’s Juri.</p><p>His message is simple, almost businesslike. He’s asking about Taiga’s Christmas plans. He can’t help but feel a pang of nostalgia, of yearning for the days when their plans were always intertwined, always “we”, never “I.” But those days are long gone.</p><p>“I have no plans,” Taiga texts back, the words tasting bitter even in the virtual space.</p><p>Juri’s reply is quick. He proposes spending at least half a day together, for appearances’ sake. But his words send a spark of hope fluttering in Taiga’s chest. Another day with Juri. Pretending or not, it’s a chance I doesn’t want to pass up.</p><p>“Yes,” he texts back, his heart pounding with anticipation.</p><p>Another day with Juri. Even if it’s pretending, even if it’s fleeting, he decides to give it a shot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>As Taiga reclines against the pillows, their small TV casting flickering shadows across their shared bedroom, he is lost in thought. Christmas lights blink lazily outside their apartment, their rhythmic glow penetrating the curtain that shields them from the world. Juri is here next to him, his presence a comforting constant in the chaotic world that is Taiga’s life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The reality show playing on our screen is about a bride-to-be and her soon-to-be husband in a heated argument, their voices too high, their expressions too intense. It’s clearly scripted, a poorly veiled ploy to garner viewers and spike ratings. The thought makes Taiga wince, and he can’t help but voice his disdain.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why do people even enjoy these scripted shows?” he asks, his voice seeping into the silence of their apartment.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because,” Juri begins, the playfulness in his voice belying the depth of his words, “weddings are a sham. They’re nothing more but a farce, promising a happily ever after that doesn’t exist.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga’s heart stutters at Juri’s words. Is this how he really sees marriage? Juri has always been more in touch with his emotions than Taiga is. But this … this is a side of him Taiga has never seen before.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Juri, do you really believe that?” he asks, his voice barely above a whisper. His heart is hammering in his chest, a frantic metronome struggling to keep pace with the tumultuous thoughts in his mind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri turns to look at him, his eyes soft, almost apologetic. “Taiga, love doesn’t require a grand celebration or a piece of paper,” he murmurs, his words echoing in the silence of their room. “Love is about being there for each other, about accepting one another’s flaws and imperfections. It’s about choosing to stay, even when the going gets tough.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His words resonate within Taiga, an echo of truth in a sea of uncertainty. He knows Juri’s fear stems from his past — his father leaving, his mother’s consequent depression. He understands why Juri views marriage as he does, why the idea of committing to someone for life terrifies him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But that doesn’t make his words sting any less.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Because Taiga dreams of marrying Juri. He envisions a future where they stand before their loved ones, declaring their love and commitment to one another. Taiga longs for the day when they become more than just two people sharing an apartment — when they become a family.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But for now, Taiga swallows his dreams, pushing them into a corner of his heart where they won’t hurt as much. For now, he lets Juri pull him closer, his warmth seeping into him, easing the sting of his words.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As Juri holds him, Taiga can’t help but hope. Hope that one day, his fear of commitment will lessen. Hope that one day, Juri will see marriage not as an end, but as a beginning. And until that day comes, Taiga will be here, loving him, supporting him, reminding him that love is not about grand gestures and legal commitments, but about the small, everyday actions that speak volumes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so, as the Christmas lights outside their apartment continue their rhythmic dance, and the couple on the screen reconcile with dramatic tears and promises of love, Taiga lets Juri’s arms around him be enough.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For now.</em>
