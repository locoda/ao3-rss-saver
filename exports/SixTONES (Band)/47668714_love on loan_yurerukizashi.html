        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! Welcome to another fic. I miss writing KyomoJuri, so hence, this.</p><p>Just some notes:
</p><p>💐 For creative purposes, Yamada and Micchi will be addressed by their first names as they are technically part of the Kyomoto family.
</p><p>💐 Taiga and Juri's points of view will alternate per chapter. Chapter 1 will be Taiga's POV, Chapter 2 will be Juri's, and so on.

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Laughter. That’s the first thing Taiga hears as he pushes the door open to the rooftop. The lights stringing across their old-fashioned picnic table twinkle in the chilly night, making his family gathered around the barbecue pit seem like actors in an old movie.</p><p>Taiga’s turning twenty-nine years old today, and they’re celebrating it the way they always do: with fire, with food, with family.</p><p>“Happy birthday, Taiga!” Ryosuke calls out from behind the grill, his normally serious face softened by the playful warmth of the fire.</p><p>Taiga’s older brother always finds comfort in order, in the system of things. He’s in his element here, organizing the food with the precision of a seasoned software developer. Taiga watches him flip a steak, a satisfied grin on his face. This is his joy.</p><p>Across the table, Shunsuke, the youngest of them, is talking animatedly, gesticulating wildly with a fork in one hand. He’s always been the most extroverted one, a whirlwind of ideas and ambition, even in his youth. Taiga thinks he likes the attention, the way he controls the conversation, even if it’s just about the latest mathematical proof or the clever quip he shared with his professor.</p><p>His father interrupts Shunsuke’s monologue with a hearty laugh. His voice, still strong despite his age, is a calming presence. He might be retired, but his commanding personality still seeps through. The family patriarch, still the Chief, even outside the boardroom.</p><p>His mother just watches them all, her soft eyes reflecting the joy of the gathering. She’s the quietest one here who finds beauty in these simple moments. She’s always been the heart of the Kyomoto family.</p><p>Taiga takes his seat at the table, his birthday cake before him, the flames dancing on the candles. He makes a wish, something he can’t put into words, something about time, and love, and regret. Then he blows out the candles.</p><p>After the claps and cheers and after each has gotten their slice of cake, Ryosuke brings up his upcoming wedding with Kanna. Three years they’ve been together, and Taiga can see the excitement in his eyes.</p><p>It’s infectious. It’s terrifying.</p><p>“Taiga,” Ryosuke asks, “Juri’s free on the wedding weekend, right? I need to finalize the hotel arrangements.”</p><p>Taiga freezes. Juri.</p><p>His heart clenches at the sound of his name. They broke up a month ago. Taiga hasn’t told anyone.</p><p>What does he do?</p><p>“Juri can’t make it,” Taiga lies.</p><p>The table falls silent. His parents’ disappointment is palpable. Even Shunsuke seems taken aback. An unfortunate consequence of your family loving your (ex-)boyfriend.</p><p>“Taiga,” his mother says, her voice filled with a subtle longing, “do you remember the first time Juri came to one of our family gatherings? He fit in so well, didn’t he?”</p><p>His mother, in her own quiet way, always knows what strings to pull to get what she wants. She can always make anyone feel like they have an obligation, a duty to the family. But she never does it harshly. It’s always a gentle nudge, a reminder of what’s important. It’s a trait of hers, a testament to her caring personality. But it can also be a weapon.</p><p>She brings up the past, forces Taiga to remember the good times they had, the times when everything was okay. She makes him remember that Juri isn’t just his ex, he’s family.</p><p>Then, she talks about the future. About Ryosuke’s wedding. She speaks with excitement Taiga can’t ignore, an anticipation that’s infectious. She talks about all the plans, all the preparations. And then she says, “And just think how wonderful it’ll be to have Juri there with us.”</p><p>It’s an indirect guilt trip. She’s not forcing Taiga to do anything. She’s making him want to do it. She’s painting the picture of a perfect wedding, a perfect weekend. A picture where Juri is present. And Taiga will feel guilty for even considering to ruin that image.</p><p>But the real kicker, the real guilt-inducing sentence she uses is: “I’ve been telling everyone about Juri. They’re all so excited to meet him.”</p><p>It’s a double blow. Not only is Taiga disappointing his family by not bringing Juri, he’s also disappointing the guests, the relatives, the friends who were looking forward to meeting him. The ones who had heard so much about Juri from Taiga’s mother.</p><p>She makes Taiga feel like he’s the one who’s letting everyone down. That his personal issues with Juri are inconveniencing everyone. That it’s his duty, his responsibility to bring Juri to the wedding.</p><p>She’s good, Kyomoto Hiromi. And she always knows how to make Taiga do what she wants.</p><p>Taiga stares down at his untouched food. He feels sick. “Okay,” he hears himself saying. “I’ll talk to him.”</p><p>
  <em>I’ll talk to him? What am I doing?</em>
</p><p>Taiga keeps his head down, hiding the panic that’s taking root in his chest. What is he going to do? The question echoes in his head. How does he tell them that he and Juri are over? Does he even want to tell them?</p><p>What if Juri doesn’t want to come? What if he does? What then? Can they pretend, just for one weekend?</p><p>Can Taiga pretend?</p><p>And he’s back to the silent wish he made, that silent prayer to time, to love, to regret. He closes his eyes, losing himself in the chaos of his thoughts. The laughter has died down. The lights seem dimmer. The night, colder.</p><p>What is he going to do?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sweat slides down Taiga’s spine, tracing the curve of his back. A final reminder of the sweltering heat as they sit in the over-air-conditioned community center downtown. It’s the end-of-summer party for the non-profit he’s been volunteering at — an organization focused on architectural preservation, which fits right up his alley. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But he’s always been a man of few words, content to work behind the scenes. It’s why he picked architecture. The physical manifestation of one’s thoughts, without uttering a single word.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Across the room, Tanaka Juri hovers near the punch table, looking as out of place as Taiga feels. Juri’s a second-year marketing student. They’ve crossed paths, sure. But they’ve never really talked. Not past the small talk about the weather, which feels redundant in a place where summer’s only temperament is “blistering.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why don’t you go talk to him?” Kochi Yugo, his best friend, nudges Taiga. He’s observant, that one.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga shrugs. “I don’t know. What would we even talk about?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Anything.” Yugo insists, rolling his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Anything,” Taiga echoes, gaze trailing over to Juri. He’s got an artist’s soul, Taiga can tell from the way he always catches Juri sketching something on his tablet. And Taiga, knowing himself to be a pragmatic type, knows he won’t blend well with the artsy types.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But with Yugo’s push, both figurative and literal, Taiga steps towards Juri. His eyes meet his, lighting up as he smiles. “Kyomoto-senpai, right? You’re in architecture.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Taiga,” Taiga corrects, returning the smile. “And you’re Tanaka, the marketing guy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I prefer Juri,” Juri chuckles. “Maybe we need to be less formal now that we’ve worked together all summer, don’t you think?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah.” Taiga nods, finding comfort in Juri’s easygoing nature so far.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The conversation picks up from there, about classes, the heat, how ridiculous it is to wear suits in this humidity. Juri talks passionately about his latest marketing project — a campaign for a local restaurant. Taiga’s drawn in, despite himself. Juri speaks with animation and excitement that Taiga can’t help but admire. Maybe it’s Juri’s creative ideas or the way he sees possibilities everywhere. Taiga doesn’t know. But it’s contagious.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon, they’re talking about their shared love for their hometown — its blend of tradition and modernity, its cultural heritage, the food. And just like that, Taiga finds himself thinking this guy isn’t so bad. He’s got a different perspective, sure. But it’s interesting. It’s refreshing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The party winds down around them, but they remain engrossed in conversation. About cityscapes and preservation, food, music, and art. Taiga doesn’t know when they cross the line from acquaintances to friends, but it feels right. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s different, stepping out of his comfort zone, engaging with someone so different. But it’s good different.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s almost eleven in the morning, the chilly Sunday air painting his Parisian-inspired apartment in a cool palette. The playful geometries of Taiga’s apartment create a facade of elegance and extravagance, a stark contrast to the chaos bubbling inside him.</p><p>Taiga paces around, his footsteps echoing in the silence. The sleek geometric carpet beneath his feet, the angular furniture around him, they all feel too sharp, too edgy. Like they’re reminding Taiga of the sharp edges of his own reality.</p><p>The apartment is too silent, too still. It feels empty. Feels empty without Juri.</p><p>Juri. Taiga’s been turning his name over in his mind since his birthday party, like a mantra. It’s been a month since they broke up, but his name still sounds foreign to him. As if it belongs to a stranger, not to the man Taiga has loved for seven years.</p><p>How did they get here? How did it fall apart?</p><p>The dial tone resonates in the hollow space, the number on his screen too familiar. The rhythm of the tone seems to match his heartbeat, speeding up, slowing down. Taiga’s pulse quickens. What if he answers? What if he doesn’t?</p><p>Three rings. Then Juri’s voice. Deep, rumbly, it fills the room. It fills Taiga. He doesn’t realize how much he missed Juri’s voice until he heard it just now.</p><p>“Taiga? What’s up?”</p><p>Juri’s question hangs in the air. What’s up? How does Taiga even begin to answer that? He’s calling his ex to ask him to pretend to be his boyfriend again. For the sake of his family. Because he couldn’t bear to tell them the truth. That they broke up. That he messed up.</p><p>“Juri, my family wants you at Ryosuke’s wedding.”</p><p>Silence. The confusion seeps into his voice. “Why would they want me there? We broke up, Taiga.”</p><p>“I … I didn’t tell them.”</p><p>Shock. Disbelief. Annoyance. Taiga can hear it all in the silence on the other end. He can imagine Juri’s face, his expression. The way his eyebrows would furrow, the way his lips would press into a thin line.</p><p>“You didn’t tell them?” Juri sounds incredulous. Annoyed. Like he can’t believe what he’s hearing. “You’re close to your family, Taiga. You see them almost every weekend. How could you not tell them?”</p><p>Taiga can’t respond. How does he even begin to explain? He was miserable. He didn’t want to rehash the breakup. He didn’t want to admit that they were over. So he didn’t.</p><p>“Mom did her guilt-tripping, Juri,” Taiga confesses. “I couldn’t tell her. Not then.”</p><p>“I’m not going to lie to your family, Taiga.” He’s firm. Decisive. Classic Juri.</p><p>“But Ryosuke already booked the accommodations …”</p><p>Taiga can almost see Juri rolling his eyes, dismissing his argument. “Talk to your family, Taiga. Tell him we drifted apart or something.”</p><p>Drifted apart? How dare he suggest something so mundane, so trivial for their seven-year relationship. “Drifted apart” is for short-lived flings, not for what they had.</p><p>“I think I should hang up now, Taiga,” Juri says, and there’s a finality to his voice that stings. “Take care of yourself.”</p><p>The line goes dead. His voice is gone. The apartment is silent again. Too silent.</p><p>Taiga sits there, the silence pressing down on him. He thought maybe Juri missed him too. He thought maybe there was still something there. But he was wrong. Juri moved on. He was fine.</p><p>And Taiga …</p><p>Taiga’s not ready to let go. He still needs Juri in his life. He thought they’d spend the rest of their lives together. And when that didn’t happen, it feels like he’s spending the rest of his life missing Juri.</p><p>A part of Taiga knows this isn’t healthy. That he needs to move on, needs to accept the truth.</p><p>But the truth hurts. The truth is that Juri is gone. And Taiga’s not ready to face a life without him. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The world of manga has always been a refuge for Taiga. A world where everything makes sense, where the characters are dependable, where there’s always a solution.</p><p><em>Detective Conan</em> has always been his favorite ever since he was a kid. His tenacity, his intelligence, his way of figuring things out, always gives him comfort.</p><p>Taiga flips through the pages, his mind simultaneously in the world of high-stakes detective work and in the world where Juri has just left him. A world that feels so much colder, so much emptier.</p><p>His phone rings, ripping Taiga from his manga-induced tranquility. The bright screen illuminates the dark room, casting long, distorted shadows. The name on the screen is like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Juri. Why hasn’t he deleted his number yet?</p><p>There’s a sinking feeling in his stomach. Fear, dread, hope? Maybe a mix of all three. Their conversation from his morning resurfaces in his mind, the words still fresh, still stinging.</p><p>Taiga answers the call, his heart pounding in his chest. What could Juri possibly want to say now?</p><p>“I’ll do it,” Juri says.</p><p>Taiga is thrown. He can hardly remember to breathe, much less understand what he’s talking about.</p><p>“Do what?” Taiga asks, confused. Maybe it’s the hunger gnawing at him, or maybe it’s the dull ache behind his eyes from reading all day.</p><p>“I’ll pretend to be your boyfriend at the wedding,” Juri clarifies.</p><p>Taiga’s world tilts on its axis. Why would Juri agree? Why now?</p><p>“But on one condition,” Juri adds.</p><p>Taiga’s heart sinks. There’s always a condition, always a catch.</p><p>“Meet me at my office tomorrow. We’ll discuss the arrangement.”</p><p>Before Taiga can respond, Juri hangs up, leaving him staring at the blank screen of his phone, the silence of his apartment pressing in on him.</p><p>What just happened? One moment Taiga is engrossed in his manga, the next, he’s thrown back into the whirlwind that is his relationship with Juri. The raw edges of the wound that was their breakup still sting, and this new development feels like salt on those wounds.</p><p>Taiga puts his manga down, the taste of reality too bitter. His apartment, his sanctuary, feels cold, impersonal. The geometric patterns that once felt playful now feel harsh, demanding.</p><p>He’s left with his thoughts, his confusion. What does Juri’s agreement mean? What’s his condition? Why did he change his mind?</p><p>But more than that, why does it matter so much to him? They’re not together anymore. Taiga should be moving on, letting go. But every time Juri’s name lights up on his screen, every time he hears Juri’s voice, he’s pulled back in.</p><p>Is this how it’s going to be? Is this what the rest of his life looks like? Living in the shadow of what they had? Of what Taiga thought they’d have?</p><p>Tomorrow, he’ll meet Juri. They’ll discuss the arrangement. And maybe then, he’ll find some clarity.</p><p>Maybe then, Taiga can start to piece his life back together. But for now, he’s left with his thoughts, his regrets, and a phone with a name he can’t bring himself to delete.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The evening is sinking in, seeping through the large windows of Taiga’s apartment, pooling in the corners with an autumnal chill. Taiga is sitting in the middle of the living room, his gaze fixed on the labyrinthine patterns of the rug beneath him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His mind, however, is elsewhere. It’s somewhere in the past, in a time when Juri was still a part of his life. When this apartment wasn’t just an echo chamber for his solitude.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Seven years. You’d think it would be hard to sum up seven years in a few words, but it’s surprisingly easy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love. Joy. Laughter. Fights. Misunderstandings. Love again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The cycle was comforting in its predictability. Even when they fought, there was always the certainty that they’d make up, that they’d find their way back to each other.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But eventually, those certainties began to crumble.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Juri had always been unsure about commitment, about settling down. It was part of his charm, the allure of a free spirit that didn’t want to be caged. Taiga had always thought that with time, with love, that uncertainty would fade. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>But it didn’t. If anything, it grew. It became a chasm between them, swallowing up their shared dreams, their shared future.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then one day, they were standing on the edge of that chasm, staring into its depths, and the realization hit them. They were no longer on the same path. Their roads had diverged, leading them in different directions. And no amount of love, no amount of trying, could bring them back together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So they parted ways. A quiet goodbye, tinged with a sadness that felt almost tangible. No blame, no anger. Just a heavy acceptance that sometimes, love isn’t enough. That sometimes, you have to let go of the person you love for the sake of your own happiness, for the sake of their happiness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A clean break, that’s what it was supposed to be. An amicable end to a chapter of their lives.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But is it really that easy? Can you truly sever the ties of seven years with a single conversation?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Apparently not, as Taiga has discovered.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The silence of the apartment wraps around him, a reminder of his solitude. He glances at the clock. It’s time. Time to meet Juri. Time to navigate this new territory of being … strangers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Can they do that? Can they pretend the love, the intimacy, the shared dreams were nothing more than a temporary blip in their lives?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Taiga doesn’t know. But what he does know is that he’s not ready to let him go completely. Not yet. Maybe that’s his folly, his inability to let go. But it’s a folly he’s willing to live with, at least for now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And so, he gets up, the patterns of the rug blurring into a sea of color as his focus shifts. Taiga walks towards the door, each step echoing in the silence of the apartment. As he steps out, a gust of autumn wind greets him, its cool fingers brushing against his skin, as if bidding him luck.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight, they’ll sit across from each other, navigating the spaces between the words, the pauses, the glances. It won’t be easy. It’ll be uncomfortable, awkward even. But it’s a step. A step towards acceptance, towards moving on.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And as the door of Taiga’s apartment closes behind him, he can’t help but wonder. Will they ever find our way back to each other? Or is this the beginning of a journey that leads us farther apart? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only time will tell. For now, all he can do is move forward, one step at a time.</em>
