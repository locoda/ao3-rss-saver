      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga goes undercover to investigate a murder in a university. Going undercover means getting close to the investigation’s prime suspect, but how close is Taiga willing to go to solve the case?</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is a long time coming, and I hope my lifetime of consuming Nancy Drew, Detective Conan, and other mystery content has prepared me for this.</p><p>This fic is inspired by the Nancy Drew computer game <i>Secrets Can Kill</i>.
</p><p>This may contain plot holes haha please ignore them. My focus is mostly on the relationship development and less on the mystery-solving portion, but hopefully I can balance both.
</p><p>For the information on the case and characters, please refer to my Twitter thread <a href="https://twitter.com/yurerukizashi/status/1625732429121220610" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Taiga frowns as he walks at the hallways of the campus, looking for the President’s Office. His meeting is in ten minutes, and although he had gone his way to arrive at the campus earlier so he wouldn’t ideally get lost, unfortunately, that’s what he is right now.</p><p>He had asked the nearby security officer and the first student he saw, but right now he feels like he’s running in circles in this maze of a campus.</p><p>And he had to come during the weekend, when there are barely any students in sight. Fantastic.</p><p><em>Maybe I should have taken up Shin’s offer to come with me</em>.</p><p>He pulls out his phone and unlocks it, revealing his wallpaper — a photo of himself, Yugo, Juri, and Shintaro. They’re standing outside their newly opened office, and he smiles at the thought. This is their first official case as a legit team, and he can’t afford to mess it up by being lost.</p><p>He’s supposed to figure it out, anyway. So he stops in the middle of the hallway and observes his surroundings, wondering if there’s any sign or piece of information that could help him. Why doesn’t this university have signage anyway?</p><p>Just as Taiga rounds a corner, he collides with someone. The impact sends him falling backward, but a hand grabs his wrist and pulls him up.</p><p>So he’s upright again, a little too close to his bumper-slash-savior’s face. But safe.</p><p>“Watch where you’re going,” a soft and smooth voice tells him.</p><p>He stares up and into dark eyes and dark, wavy curls and a soft smile. Taiga blinks, finding the man <em>handsome</em>, like the world suddenly turned into this romcom anime world with sparkles bursting out of this fine fellow.</p><p>Then he realizes —</p><p>“Oh my god, I’m so sorry.” Taiga steps back, still feeling the man’s grip on his wrist linger. “You okay?”</p><p>“I should be asking you the same.” The man chuckles. “My fault, though. I wasn’t looking either.”</p><p><em>Handsome and kind</em>. “I’m lost.” Taiga scratches the back of his head. “I was looking for the President’s Office, and there isn’t a single signage in this campus, so I’ve been in circles for a while now.”</p><p>“President’s Office?” The man blinks. “Well, it just so happens I’m on my way there, too. We should go together.”</p><p>Taiga smiles at that. “Sounds good.”</p><p>The man holds out his hand. “I’m Hokuto. Hokuto Matsumura. Fine Arts.”</p><p>“Taiga Kyomoto, but Taiga’s fine.” Taiga shakes Hokuto’s hand and feels its softness. Totally not what he expected. “Just transferred here, but I’m in Fine Arts, too.”</p><p>So far, so good. At least he didn’t blurt out “I know” when Hokuto introduced himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>President Yoshihiko Inohara is seated on his chair, reading a stack of papers when Taiga enters. The secretary calls his attention, and he looks up and smiles at Taiga’s presence.</p><p>“Taiga.” He stands up and extends his hand. “Look at you, all grown up.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs as he shakes his hand. “And you, Uncle Inocchi, haven’t aged a bit.”</p><p>“I hope that’s a compliment because these past few days have aged me.” Inohara laughs as he runs a hand through his hair. He gestures for Taiga to sit down before sitting himself.</p><p>“Why doesn’t this campus have signange? I spent half an hour looking for this office because I can’t find anyone to ask for directions. It took me bumping into Hokuto Matsumura to get here.”</p><p>Inohara looks up from his paperwork. “Y-You ran into Matsumura?”</p><p>“On his way here. He’s waiting outside, by the way.”</p><p>“Anyone with him?”</p><p>“Just him.”</p><p>“That means Toma would come over in a few minutes.” He sets aside his paper and puts his hands together. “So let’s make this quick. I’m sure you’ve already read the case file?”</p><p>Taiga nods.</p><p>“The last thing I want is for you to be involved, but if it’s your line of work, then I can’t stop you. Your father can’t either.” Inohara sighs. “But if anything happens to you —“</p><p>“<em>Nothing</em> will happen to me.” Taiga balls his hand into a fist against the fabric of his pants. “I’ve solved hundreds of cases now, Uncle. I can handle this.”</p><p>“Well, I am president of this university, and I still have the final say into how much police or detective involvement I want in this case. But I want this case solved as soon as possible. I’m giving you as much leeway into breaking some of the school rules because you’re technically not a student, but any grave offenses, and I’m pulling you out.”</p><p>Taiga nods. “How many people know about me and my friends going undercover?”</p><p>“Just me and the Secretary. Not even the Athletics Office know. At this point, I have to treat everyone else as a suspect.”</p><p>“Okay.” Taiga relaxes. “I <em>will</em> get to the bottom of this.”</p><p>“I know.” Inohara smiles. “Your father always complains about it, but I’m sure he’s proud of you, too.” He presses a button on his desk. “Ami, send Matsumura and Ikuta in.”</p><p>Taiga looks over his shoulder as the door opens. Hokuto steps in, as well as a man with brown, wavy hair. Taiga recognizes him as Toma Ikuta, the coach of the archery club.</p><p>“Good, you two are here.” Inohara stands up. “Matsumura, I’ve heard from Taiga you helped him find his way here?”</p><p>Hokuto nods, eyeing Taiga curiously. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll keep this short because I’m sure you’re busy with practice.” Inohara puts his hands together. “Toma, I’d like you to meet my nephew, Taiga Kyomoto. He just transferred here, and he’ll be assistant manager to your club.”</p><p>Toma blinks in surprise as he shakes Taiga’s hand. “Didn’t know we need an assistant manager.”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure your manager needs it, given all that’s happened,” Inohara comments. “And since he’s a Fine Arts major, I thought Matsumura could give him a hand. You know, show him around the campus and in the club.”</p><p>Hokuto’s brows furrow at him, and Taiga manages a smile. “Surprise?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Their office looks more like a vacation retreat, with wooden walls and wide windows giving those inside a view of the trees. Though those outside would not be able to see in.</p><p>No one would suspect that it is actually a private investigation office.</p><p>Taiga sighs as he slumps down the white, plush chair and plops his bag on the glass coffee table. He hadn’t done much apart from being introduced by his uncle to Matsumura and Ikuta, but getting lost in campus has already drained him. It’s only the first day, but he’s exhausted and excited at the same time.</p><p>The chimes ring, and Taiga looks at the direction of the door. His best friend Yugo Kochi had just entered with a plastic bag bearing the logo of their favorite restaurant.</p><p>“Oh, hey, you’re back,” Yugo greets with a smile as he shrugs off his shoes. “How did your first day of school go?”</p><p>Taiga laughs. “You sound like a mom,” he remarks, standing up to help Yugo unpack the delivery in the office pantry. “I got lost, Hokuto Matsumura came to help me get to Uncle Inocchi’s office, but so far so good. Uncle laid out some ground rules for the investigation and introduced me to Matsumura and the coach, and that’s it. At most, they were surprised to be having an assistant manager come along given everything that’s happened.”</p><p>“I hope they didn’t suspect anything.”</p><p>“As far as I can tell, they didn’t.” Taiga shakes his head. “This undercover thing is fun, though. <em>And</em> I get to experience what it’s actually like to go to a school after all these years.”</p><p>He had always wanted to experience college life. Having been homeschooled all his life and having taken online courses after high school, Taiga had always envied Yugo, Juri, and Shintaro whenever they walk to school then come over to talk about their classmates, their teachers, their school trips …</p><p>At least Taiga will get a bit of the experience, if only for a few months.</p><p>It had to take a long talk with his father, but he’s of age now, and he can make his own decisions just fine.</p><p>Soon, Juri and Shintaro arrive, and they gather at the office pantry to toast at the beginning of Detail One, a private investigation office that the four of dream dreamed to run since they were kids.</p><p>Well, mostly it was Taiga’s dream. Yugo was initially reluctant to be roped into Taiga’s case-solving schemes in high school, but someone had to make sure Taiga doesn’t land into trouble. And Juri, being Yugo’s close friend in high school, has to make sure Yugo doesn’t get into hot water. And Shintaro is Taiga’s cousin who had promised to protect him since they were kids.</p><p>It had taken Taiga years of building connections, being an armrest detective for the police’s unsolved crimes, a lot of saving up to set up a company, and a lot convincing Taiga’s father, but here it is. It finally happened.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“So, what have we got so far?”</p><p>After dinner, they move back to the office lounge. Shintaro has pulled out the whiteboard they’ll be using during the entire investigation. It’s already full of information, with the photo of the victim on the crime scene at the dead center. Taiga has drawn arrows connecting the victim and the possible suspects.</p><p>Hokuto Matsumura’s photo is huge, his photo next to the victim’s. It’s his ID photo, as generously provided by his Uncle Inocchi. Just like in person, Hokuto Matsumura bears a soft expression, and Taiga remembers the smile given to him when they ran into each other at campus that day.</p><p>But below his photo are bullet points that Taiga has taken from the case file his other uncle (no, not Uncle Inocchi, the uncle that’s Shintaro’s dad). In red letters, Taiga had written “PRIMARY SUSPECT.”</p><p>Taiga had solved countless cases in the past few years, and he always wonders how someone seemingly so kind could commit such horrendous acts.</p><p>He mentally shakes his head. He has always treated suspects as innocent until proven guilty, and Hokuto should be treated the same way.</p><p>Taiga stands up and heads to the whiteboard. “I was introduced to Matsumura and Coach Ikuta today,” he tells them. “Nothing suspicious from them at the moment, but Uncle Inocchi gave me a duplicate of the keys to the archery range, so I should be visiting there before everyone else arrives.”</p><p>“I’ve done background checks on the archery club,” Shintaro announces, sipping his second can of beer. “Everyone’s squeaky clean. No criminal background.”</p><p>“Even Matsumura?” Juri asks, squeezing beside Yugo on the couch.</p><p>Shintaro shakes his head. “He’s the ideal student. Good grades, one of the top athletes in the archery club, has only a few friends but is likeable among other students. Girls and guys practically worship him.”</p><p>“Even after the murder?” Yugo asks.</p><p>Shintaro shrugs.</p><p>“That’s for me to find out, I guess,” Taiga says with a nod. “So, tomorrow I’m checking the archery range. Uncle Inocchi got me into the same classes as Matsumura, so I’ll be tailing him.”</p><p>“Just be careful.” Yugo frowns.</p><p>“I know, I know, you sound like my dad.” Taiga waves a hand. “It’s our first big case as an agency. I’m not gonna screw this up.”</p><p>They continue discussing what else they can do when Taiga’s phone vibrates. It’s a message from Matsumura, who had asked for his number, given that Taiga’s supposedly a transfer student and in the same major as him. Not to mention their new assistant manager at the archery club.</p><p>The message is pretty long, too perfectly constructed.</p><p>“<em>Hi, Kyomoto! We should give you a proper tour of the campus before you start with your first class. Are you a morning person? We could start after breakfast. :)</em>”</p><p>Taiga figures he could check the archery range by six in the morning, at most. (He gives himself a reminder to remind Yugo to wake him up just in time.) He types up a reply.</p><p>“<em>Not that of a morning person, but I’m willing to be one if breakfast is free. How does 8 am sound?</em>”</p><p>Matsumura’s reply comes in seconds.</p><p>“<em>Sounds great. Breakfast’s on me. See you at the campus gates at 8!</em> :)”</p><p>For some reason, the smiley emoji at the end puts a smile on Taiga’s face.</p>
