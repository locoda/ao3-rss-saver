    <h2 class="toc-heading">The Three Little Wolves</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>A simple touch means the world. The kissing sound was pleasurable. It was deafening. It’s intoxicating as you just don’t want it to stop. The more the sound of kisses feels delightful, the more your lust rises to blow your mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You alright with this?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto took a sip on Runa’s nipple, and gradually threw a peck and a sweet light kiss to the same spot where he sucked. Hokuto’s tongue was tickling, but had a good rhythm to make her unconsciously grind herself upon him. His tip of the tongue made her pant heavily, and her body spoke the truth by twitching endlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the moment his other hand squeezed her other breast, Runa pulled Hokuto’s head closer to him to get more pressure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ahh…. Ahhh…" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa was never more fascinated by the act Hokuto played on her. She fixates on Hokuto being at the bottom and figures out what kind of play she was into. His heavy breath seduced her, and her moan aroused him. Hokuto's roaring jack made Runa stop for a while and took a glance at his sweet little rounded eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Fuck it!" Runa moaned to the ceiling. She was wet enough and longing for him without further ado. "Fuck me!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What about the fertile day of yours?" Hokuto tried to dissuade her desire for intimacy, but she said she was content with the upper play during her fertile day. But Hokuto’s play screwed her mind as she wanted him more to screw on her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I’m on my fertile day and I’m so down to do it," Runa’s breath got heavier as if she wanted him </span>
  <em>
    <span>right now </span>
  </em>
  <span>down there. She embraced Hokuto’s head between her bare breasts and grabbed his hand on her buttocks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What if Jesse and Juri came home?" Hokuto traced her chest while rolling his eyes at her. The way he tried to stop her </span>
  <em>
    <span>verbally</span>
  </em>
  <span> doesn’t match what he did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I could keep myself low," Runa said, and then made him touch her intimate parts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What if they overheard us?" Hokuto still tried to tease her mischievously. The more Hokuto teased her, the more Runa lost her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That should be your problem," She took a sip on his neck and bit him playfully as a threat that he would get the real one if he refused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I locked my door tho," he smiled mischievously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then don't ask," Runa said as she drew him into her embrace and let him be the top of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto, Juri, and Jesse were living under the same roof. They met in some circle and moved into the same share house by a twist of fate. Like the house was built for them, there are only three of them living there. The sharehouse wasn’t that big, but it was spacious enough for the three of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As time goes by, all the tendencies they have can’t be hidden anymore. The three of them were three poles apart, even though they were born close. As if there’s a social butterfly, there’s an introverted homey boy. There’s also someone in between. As if there’s a flashy one, there’s also an old-style guy. Again, there’s also someone in between. As if there’s a nerdy one, there’s also a silly one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The athletic one, the flabby one…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The cool-blooded one, the hot-blooded one… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The expressive one, the flat-faced one… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And there’s always someone in between… </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was always poles apart. Nevertheless, they struck an impressive balance. Since the mediator is also the three of them, their crib was never a battlefield. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They share everything in their own way. They have their own ways of communicating, dealing with things, and keeping themselves apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And no exception in the realm of love. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, </span>
  <em>
    <span>sweetheart</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Just touch down on the crib by now," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse turned on his video call as he reached home. He just went to Aoi’s apartment to celebrate their belated anniversary. The two of them are just so flooded by their work that they don’t even have time to see each other. It was difficult for the two of them, who really wanted to be together as much as they could, while the reality said no. The one and only thing that could fill their lonely presence is their words' affirmation towards each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, you seemed to forget something," Aoi, who hadn't turned her camera on earlier, surprised her man by showing up with a pair of red underwear and a necktie that covered her cleavage. "It’s really big on me,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the—" Jesse couldn’t hold his laughter as he caught the sexy appearance of his girl. He flushed his cheeks as he had never looked at her body before. The words coming out of her mouth were definitely not something she meant </span>
  <em>
    <span>literally</span>
  </em>
  <span>. "….Thank God I’m wearing my earphones. Anyway, where are your clothes? I left your house about one hour ago,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was doing some workouts. It’s so hot here. Can’t you see my sweat? Look!" Aoi took her phone closer to her sweaty bra. "I’m sweaty," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse gulped at what he saw on his camera phone. He took a deep breath to pull himself together before getting back to focusing on Aoi. ".....wow, that’s a lot of sweat," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"When will we meet again?" Aoi rested her back on her bed. Her appearance was increasingly appealing as she placed her phone right on her head, as if Jesse was on top of her. "I want to give this back to you,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aoi lifted Jesse’s necktie on her so he could see her half bare breast more clearly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Soon, </span>
  <em>
    <span>baby girl</span>
  </em>
  <span>… Better keep that necktie close to you so you won’t miss me,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That’s not what I meant!" she whined. "It wasn’t enough… See? I’m still longing for you down there,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aoi shifted her phone to her lower body, </span>
  <em>
    <span>slowly</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and showed him how wet her panties were–because of her sweat–. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Where are you learning this from?" Jesse was unable to believe his ears after hearing how Aoi seduced him with her dirty talk. His grin was unstoppable, and he could feel his twanger hardening. However, he still had to get himself under control, so he wouldn’t get everyone’s attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Ahh… Ahhhh…</span>
  </em>
  <span>"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What’s that?" Aoi’s antenna went hard as she heard a dim moan through Jesse’s phone. She then went straight to her bed, sat herself down, and waited for an explanation from her man.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shit! Not again!" he swore. Jesse then fastened his step to the living room and found Juri was bonking an unfamiliar woman. "For God's sake, Juri! Get a room!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You’re home," like it was nothing, Juri just stopped thrusting and greeted his roommate just like that. And the unfamiliar woman herself is topsy turvy just looking at that 6’04” tall man. "Hokuto is with Runa! Maybe they’re doing the same thing,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"At least they got their room!" He grumbled, then passed through the hallway so he could go to his room. "…and I don’t have to know about that!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Clack! </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa and Hokuto jolted as Jesse tried to open Hokuto’s room. The two of them stop moving despite how they’re becoming </span>
  <em>
    <span>one</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Thankfully, Hokuto locked his door properly, so no one could get in just like that when Hokuto had his </span>
  <em>
    <span>own time</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hokuto! Juri brought home another random woman inside the house!" Jesse knocked twice and snitched what he saw. His phone was still connected with Aoi, but Aoi was already wrapped up in an oversized shirt he left in her apartment. At that time, Jesse knew that Aoi’s mood had been ruined by a random woman Juri had brought to their share house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto was about to answer, but Runa shut his mouth and teased him with a gentle thrust above him, so his attention was completely attracted to her. She then gave her man a seductive smile before locking his mouth with her tongue and inviting him over to her oral play. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A smooching sound that was supposed to be so low felt like ear popping. Hokuto couldn’t stop worrying about how Jesse would eavesdrop on his door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"…the hell he’s not answering me!" He muttered and blew his fist at the door before getting back to his own room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa could just giggle in silence as she found Jesse grumpy. She then turned around and grinned like a Cheshire cat, feeling proud of her action. "It was quite thrilling," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You fruitcake!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dumbfounded by her sly action, Hokuto blitzed her ear one more time, licked her favorite spot, and gave the last spurt before she finally burst her thick liquid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, can I stay here tonight?" Runa took Hokuto’s clothes and wrapped her naked body with Hokuto’s oversized shirt. The shirt stretched out to cover her thighs, but the collar drooped to show one of her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>no</span>
  </em>
  <span>!" Hokuto denied it after he gave her a glimpse of hope. So typical of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why? I’ll sleep with you,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Sure you are!" He scoffed and slid across his bed to pat her head. "But I don’t want to see you strolling around this house, out of my watch, especially with my clothes in the dining room having a cup of tea with Jesse in the early morning,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I don’t get it," Runa pouted. "This shirt probably helps me to not let anyone get closer to me, though,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>This shirt</span>
  </em>
  <span>? With your shoulder showing recklessly like this? Over my dead body!" Hokuto glared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Not only are poles apart from the rest of the two in this house, Hokuto also has a lot of things that are at cross purposes with Runa. There are a lot of things that are not a big deal for her but matter a lot to him. Hokuto really wants her to put her eyes on him, only for him. If it had to be said, Runa and Jesse resembled each other a lot. And Runa’s outward appearance is one of a kind of Juri’s type. Hokuto was worried that Runa felt more comfortable with Jesse since they had a lot in common. Or maybe she would turn her eyes to Juri since Juri was so good at pleasing people. That’s why he doesn’t want her to be around with the rest of the two if he’s not around. Especially in her effortless appearance, which makes her more appealing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You really don’t want to stay here tonight?" Runa wrapped her arms around Hokuto’s neck as he sent her home in the middle of the night. He decided to borrow Juri’s car and go straight to Runa’s apartment to save time. "......It's freezing outside,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Maybe next time. I have an early schedule tomorrow," Hokuto smiled wistfully. Being with her is not enough. Even though he was always longing for time to be by himself, he liked being pampered by her and her infinite frenzy. "…don’t stay up too late, okay?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Can’t promise you, tho," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I can’t stay with you forever," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can’t?" she teased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"……….fine," Hokuto gave up on her invitation. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>❦❦❦❦❦</span>
</p><p>
  <span>❦❦❦❦❦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Chirp… Chirp…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Clack… </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto went back to the share house when the sun rose. As he opened the door, he could smell the flavor of hot coffee filling the entire dining room. When he stepped closer, he could see Jesse and Juri were already gathered at the counter of the dining room. Jesse was pouring some coffee into his cup, but Juri was still closing his eyes while having a seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You’re back," Jesse greeted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. Better stay outside than sleep here while hearing a random woman moaning," Hokuto slapped Juri’s car key roughly on the table to wake him up. ".......We gotta talk about last night. </span>
  <em>
    <span>For real</span>
  </em>
  <span>,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"For sure! Thanks a lot for ruining my time with Aoi!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the fuck?! So you all guys can bring girls but I can’t?" Juri knitted his brows at his roommate’s complaint. Not to mention, he’s not a morning person, so that morning was not a perfect time for him to be judged and think clearly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I said, a </span>
  <em>
    <span>random </span>
  </em>
  <span>woman," Hokuto asserted. "....or at least get a room for the two of you for God's sake! This is our common space!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I thought you weren't home," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Nah! You said to me Hokuto was with Runa and might be doing the same thing as you did last night," Jesse smashed Juri’s silly excuse in a speed light. "And you, Hokuto! You didn’t even answer me when I knocked on your door last night,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I was taking a nap," Hokuto threw off the scent. "And just because I wasn’t home, it doesn’t make your action correct! How am I supposed to sit there after I saw you clasping some random bitches right there? Ugh, I can’t even imagine myself having a seat in your marking area,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I’m not a dog!" Juri beefed. "Besides, I put on the sheet to cover it and threw it to the washing machine right after she has gone," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That’s not my point, you dumbass!" Hokuto yelled. "Don’t you even try to mix it with my clothes! Or perhaps just bring that to the dry cleaners!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why didn’t you find the real one instead of collecting friends with benefits that you didn’t even know who she is?" Jesse put the screws to Juri’s bad habit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Hmph</span>
  </em>
  <span>! My love is worth a king’s ransom for just one girl," Juri’s smug face increasingly provoking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In spite of being born close, Hokuto, Juri, and Jesse are perfectly different characters. Everything is always poles apart, like triplets that complete each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse is the most cheerful and chatty one among the others. He is a social butterfly who could enlighten the mood and bring laughter wherever he is. But sometimes, he went too far that he needed someone to stop him. There was also the time that he couldn’t read the weather or be negative about the situation he wasn’t good at. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Juri is the most </span>
  <em>
    <span>hikikomori</span>
  </em>
  <span> of them all. Funny story, he is also a social butterfly who is really good at pleasing people. He was capable of controlling the situation and loved parties. However, he loves to spend his day off by staying the night or sleeping all day long like a bat. His stable mentality and mind made him have no desire to put more effort into something. He thinks that if it is really meant for him, it will come smoothly for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Hokuto is the person that has the most presence of mind of them all. He is an introverted person who doesn't open his heart to people easily. But he could turn into a cheeky boy for people who he let into his space. He breaks down his behavior towards people into sections, but he could be the kindest and most respectful to someone he just met. Unfortunately, if it had to be said, Hokuto is a negative person who underestimates himself most of the time. However, his frame of mind turned into an ambition that made him undaunted to try something to see if he was really as hopeless as he thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Second of all, their love lives also create a terrific equilibrium. Each of them has their own way of expressing their affection for someone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The half-white man, Jesse, inherited his father’s way of expressing love towards someone. He expresses his feelings verbally and through physical touch. He is also the one who chases after someone he likes. He’s a hunter type who won’t give up until he gets what he wants. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the other hand, Hokuto wasn’t really good at expressing his feelings verbally. He is prone to expressing his feelings through physical touch or being eager to help. He’s a herbivore that is waiting for someone to chase him but would turn into a wolf and chase them back like his own prey as soon as he gets his conviction. However, he wants his partner to express themselves verbally, so he doesn’t have to pull on tactics and turn everything into a misunderstanding as it was an unspoken thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oppositely, Juri stands apart from the idea of a girl who makes the first step. He took it as a hypothesis that the one who should’ve made the first move is the man. But for all that, Juri is not the hunter type, not even the prey who was waiting to be chased. He doesn’t want his personal space to be intruded upon. If and only if he takes someone’s feelings seriously, he doesn’t want her to be the aggressive one. Despite how he looks, he really likes the Yamato Nadeshiko type who lets him stand in the first line for the sake of the family. As if he is likely to enjoy his life wholeheartedly, he likes to shoot the breeze with someone who looks dazzling just like him. And Runa fits perfectly with the type of person he was looking for to chew the rag. Fortunately, Runa is now with Hokuto, so she will not be one of Juri's prey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Funny story, Hokuto, who seemed the calmest of them all, has the biggest lust among the three of them, and Juri is in second place. Juri thinks it likely that his sexual desire is a biological need and he doesn’t need love to fulfill that. Just like having a meal, he just has to find his </span>
  <em>
    <span>food </span>
  </em>
  <span>whenever he’s hungry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At glance, Juri might seem like the one who has the biggest libido. But who even thought that Juri would put up white flags as Hokuto started talking dirty and being cheeky? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the meantime, Hokuto needs his sexual urges to be fulfilled a couple of times a week. It is not a pleasant thing when he and Runa have their own schedules that make the two of them could just meet every two weeks or once a month. Of course, their dating plan would cost a stay over attending, two to three days straight, to fulfill one another’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>needs</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But when the time wasn’t right, Hokuto should wank himself before bedtime or when the sun rose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oppositely, Jesse, who was born in a family circumstance where physical touch is a common thing, prefers cuddles rather than relieving his lust recklessly. He doesn’t mind if someone catches him kissing his girl in public or letting his girl into his embrace. But he theorizes that further intimacy is just for the two of them. Of course, the way he touched his girl clearly shows others how he could attack his girl when his lust blinds him. Nonetheless, despite his outward appearance, which suggests that he would fall every time someone enticed him, he is an earnest, true-hearted man to his girl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even though Hokuto has the most horniness of them all, Hokuto doesn’t like to show how he’s seducing or being seduced by his girl. Hokuto might be the one who seems to have the most idyllic appearance, but he’s craving to keep his girl just for himself. Along with his desire for her undivided attention, he sometimes does not want to show others how well she treated him, because any gap in her could be interpreted as her effortless beauty, which could attract the other wolf. And that’s why he’s being super protective of Runa. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hey, my brother just sent me an invitation to a private nightclub in town. He said that there’s a party on Friday night and everyone who gets this is invited," Juri scrolled his phone screen to search for further information about the place mentioned. "....dress code, </span>
  <em>

  </em>
  <span> fantasy….,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So?" Jesse sipped his coffee, pretending he knew nothing about what his roommate meant. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Saucy Fantasy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s obviously a party for adults. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I mean, come with me," he emphasized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I knew it, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Jesse sighed. "Zero. Aoi definitely forbids me to go there,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Then don’t tell her," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That won’t happen. We keep in touch at any moment, even when I hang out with my colleague,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You can still hit her there, right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What should I be supposed to say if she suddenly calls me?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Didn’t hear you call</span>
  </em>
  <span>?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Too obvious. She knows I’m a night owl," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ugh! Come on! It’ll be fun!" Juri fussed. "How about you take her there? You guys could also be mating somewhere without catching someone’s eyes," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You think I can’t hear her moaning every time I pass through?" He grinned, recalling his memories every time Juri wanted to go to his room on the second floor. "….these walls weren’t that thick, you know?! I bet Hokuto could also hear you guys so he spent most of the day in the living room," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jesse went crimson as he knew their act was a skeleton for Juri and Hokuto. Certainly, Jesse knew that Aoi tends to let her voice out when she feels good, but he didn’t expect Juri could hear everything from outside, —or downside for Hokuto—. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet he thought Juri’s invitation wasn’t a bad idea, so he decided to bring Aoi out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"…..hey, </span>
  <em>
    <span>honey</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I have a present for you. Could you come to my place on Saturday night? Put on some makeup, 'cause I’ll take you out," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Juri succeeds in convincing Jesse to come with him, he intends to ask Hokuto as well to come with him. He could imagine how much fun that night would be if the three of them went together—even if the other two brought their own girl—. Juri knew that as Hokuto tends to throw some vulgar words and dirty jokes, he might also be interested in this kind of uncontrollable party vibe. Unfortunately, the whisper from nowhere that told him Hokuto mightn’t come was crystallized. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto considers that this may be his only opportunity to bring Runa to his home without being bothered. He thought, at last, he could finally fulfill his dream of having a homey date in his own house, even though he had to let Runa go home before everyone woke up the next morning. Nevertheless, he could at least let her stroll around the house in any pajamas she wanted without being seen by the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In some such way, Juri reckoned Hokuto’s frame of mind that made him not surrender just like that. He then took all roads that led to Rome and reached Runa to bell the cat and sink her teeth into it. Certainly, a party sounds electrifying as she could doll up as she liked. She even felt more desirous as Juri told her the party details.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa then prepared some tricks to string her man along so Hokuto would come to the party. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Finally, home for the two of us," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One hour passed after Jesse, Juri, and Aoi left the house. Hokuto deliberately does nothing to Runa to avoid the risk of the three of them getting back together all of a sudden to grab something left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their excitement about this private party felt so long during the weekdays but felt like a blink as the weekend came. Not only for Juri and Jesse, but Hokuto also feels the same excitement as they are. He invited Runa to come earlier so she could stick with Aoi for a while, and he didn’t have to see any </span>
  <em>
    <span>cozy </span>
  </em>
  <span>act in front of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So, what are we gonna do tonight?" Runa sits on Hokuto’s lap as he throws himself on the couch. Hokuto’s face turned displeased just right until she gave him a touch. "....screw me on this couch instead of your room, maybe? With this wide space… Just the two of us…,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She threw some pecks as she ended every phrase she said. The kisses went through his sharp jaw, his Adam’s apple, and his collarbone. Hokuto then gradually lost his sanity as she went down to his chest, throwing some pecks through his shirt, pulled off his shirt to taste his well-built stomach, and went down through his crotch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto’s groan echoed through the entire spacious living room he had. He didn’t know that letting his voice be heard without concern for who could hear it was so delightful. As she mounts to his pole and sucks it as she means it, the salutation she gave on his bulk becomes more erotic. A ticklish feeling he felt from her soft tongue and her sucking power made him no longer control his liquid to explode. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Ahh… Ahhh….,</span>
  </em>
  <span>" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto whimpered like he was about out of breath. He reached his max level of pleasure as he didn’t realize he was shoving her head closer to his groin. A load of liquid blew up into her mouth along with his last groan before Runa stopped to collect them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Aah~!!! Tissue! Tissue!" Hokuto grabbed some tissue in front of him and helped her wipe his liquid off her face. "….Can’t believe I did the same thing after lecturing Juri about having sex on the couch," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"He doesn’t have to know," Runa’s evil whisper soothed him down. "….hey, why don’t we go to that private party?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That won’t happen," Hokuto replied without a second thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on! It’ll be fun!" She fussed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No way! Your body belongs to me and no one can see it!" He emphasized his words, recalling how Aoi looked like when she left the house with Juri and Jesse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>"Of course, I belong to you! That’s the only reason I'm asking you for this. The only thing you should worry about is if I go there without you, right?" She harped on the fact, making him lost for words. "Besides, everyone is there to enjoy the party. No one would pay attention to me, especially</span> <span>with you by my side. And I bet you won’t let me be by myself there, am I right?" </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"….," Runa is really good at convincing him. She could turn any objection into approval by giving him facts and proving to him she knows what she is doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"We can also wear masks there since it’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>fantasy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. No one should know who we are, especially Juri and Jesse," she added. "……And it’s my lifetime request. So, pretty please with the cherry on top?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Don’t say the word you don’t mean it," he sighed. "Fine, let’s go!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yay!!!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But promise me one thing!" He grabbed her wrist as she stood up off the ground. The gravity she lost made her bend herself and apart just a few centimeters in front of him. "…..don’t let them know, and when I say go home, we’re going home,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Those are two things!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Runa!!!"</span>

<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>A piece of electronic dance music could be heard a few meters away from the entrance. The ceramic dance floor that was supposed to be thick could not even bear its vibration. As Hokuto and Runa took a step closer to the hall, they could feel their heartbeat pounding recklessly, being so impatient to see what was behind that door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto hung back for a while as he observed his surroundings. He threw his sight into it since it was such an early Halloween party with a sparkle of dangerous scent all over the place. The scent of cigarettes, strong perfumes, bold makeup, masks, an erotic performance above the stage, and the scenery of how people cop a feel towards each other like it’s not a big deal. The two of them could feel their blood rushing so fast as they could see some people kissing each other randomly, taking off each other’s attire, and tasting each other’s aphrodisiac parts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let’s go!" Runa grabbed him inside, paying no attention to her surroundings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the far side, Juri was completely head over heels for some girls he had caught. The uncountable kisses he received from several girls around him made him wilder as he tasted their tits that were uncovered by nothing else but a pair of flower nipple covers. In exchange for that, he didn't mind them stripping off his attire, </span>
  <em>
    <span>lingeringly</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In one corner of the club, several rooms were covered by a pearl curtain. Red, blue, purple, or dim light colors in there emblazed inside, inflamed the temptation of dangerous play everybody had in there. Aoi and Jesse were about to take the only empty seat at the bar counter, but before they went further, Jesse impulsively grabbed her arm and took her mingling with several lesbians mating inside those private rooms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why are you taking me here?" Aoi furrowed her brows as she noticed the lesbians were five-sixth naked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Some privacy for both of us," he replied playfully, but Aoi doesn’t get his point of taking her to a place that was full of boobs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Privacy </span>
  <em>
    <span>your ass</span>
  </em>
  <span>! No way!!" she spurned. She has no idea what makes Jesse think this, as she could just see boobs everywhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You think I go bananas without thinking straight? Of course, I won’t take you to the heterosexuals. I don’t want you to see their poles, and definitely won’t take you to the gays either," he uttered in her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"So you think you can see boobs?" She replied, still not satisfied by his explanation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come on! They have no eyes on me!" Jesse rolled his eyes. "I’m the only hunter in here. I chose my prey and I chose </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aoi was easily convinced by Jesse. His words of affirmation always made his way to calm every foreboding she had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Look at them closely and tell me what play you like," his whisper tickled her fancy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>❦❦❦❦❦</span>
</p><p>
  <span>❦❦❦❦❦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Finally! Here, have a seat!" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa gave up the only seat she could catch to Hokuto so he could take a load off his feet for a while. Rather than being aroused, he seemed on pins and needles in situations he wasn’t good at. His unease even increased as Runa took off her white faux fur coat and sat herself down on the counter table with nothing but appealing maroon lingerie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wha—," Hokuto couldn't say in response to her appearance. He didn’t expect that Runa was just wearing lingerie behind her coat that only covered her upper body. </span>
  <em>
    <span>So she's not like she's dressing as a Santa girl?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto should’ve believed his gut that told him he’d better check Runa’s outfit, and he literally paid for his naive thoughts as he thought Runa dolled up herself as a Santa Girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She then held him closer to her body so she could get a snog from him. "See? No one’s paying attention to us," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could just stare open-mouthed at her sharp eyes behind her mask. She also left him no clue as she suddenly turned his seat facing the dance floor and made him see how people were shagging on the dance floor like some cult doing its ritual. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto sensed thin ice. Cold, risky, but thrilling. Especially when Runa got down from the table and started to lay her finger on his half-covered chest. He was about to lose his mind as Runa reached his nipple and started tracing his neck. He twitched unconsciously as Runa sneaked under his trousers and rubbed his prick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Let me have a bite of you," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa walked before him and bent herself, unzipping his trousers and letting his twanger out of his pants. The dangerous feeling he had felt like magic. He felt this indecency, filth, guilt, and pleasure. As he felt nirvana surrounding him, he didn’t know how to come to an end. And when he concluded that he thought that it was pointless to run from heaven, he started to lose his mind and go wilder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he spurted his liquids into her mouth, Runa locked her gaze on him, and spewed his liquid and dirt onto her chin, letting it drip down to her half-bare breast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa stole Hokuto’s mouth for the umpteenth time. She served him a lizard kiss while she was trying to cleanse her palate. His warm breath made her blush. Despite how wild she had gone, she was still captivated by the affection of gentle touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she went back to her wildness, Hokuto suddenly turned his moving stool. Facing back to the counter as Runa let him sit for the first time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa has woken up the wolf inside him. Hokuto is now putting a full focus on herself and cares nothing about the set. On the spur of the moment, he held her up to the bar table. He made her bend her legs above the table and spread her thighs widely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could just gulp at the sight of her beaver peeking from her g-string inside her lingerie. He was blown away by how clever she was, left him in his imagination of dressing up like a sassy Santa girl, but turning into the most angelic demon full of lust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t think straight. Neither does he. So he drowned himself in the vice and made her beyond belief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Runa went crazy as she felt his tongue pleasuring her cockpit. Even though she used to make herself in silence, along with her timidity about letting her voice out, she could hear nothing as the music concealed every moan she let out. Runa tried to stop Hokuto from being greedier down there, but Hokuto was too good to do his job. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For the first time, Runa squirted her liquids so badly that she had no control over her body anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Come," Hokuto says, helping her down from the table. Even though she’s spotlighted under the dim light, Hokuto could see the red hue on her cheeks, which makes her look so fresh. Seeing her like that makes him reminisce about what their first night felt like. It was calm, but felt so wild. While yet, it was stable, but uncontrollable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto made her face the sexual union kind of cult before them, while Hokuto faced the bar while covering Runa’s body from the public with his broad body. He let her trace how she wanted to be treated and made her fantasy rule her mind. Runa grinds her body over Hokuto’s lap. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>tutorial</span>
  </em>
  <span> before her makes her longing for </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> well-formed to stuff her hole down there. She was calculating when it was the perfect time to get it into her honey pot. Although she was wet enough, she determines that she needs some more before her body completely controls her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto found himself longing for something soft to grip. Before he could actually think clearly, he found himself massaging one of Runa’s breasts. He even put out the rest and started giving her some stimuli to turn her on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Jes… No… No…." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the other side, Aoi was bumping herself with her back facing her man. With Jesse’s two hands stimulating her breast, she got wilder as she no longer had the presence of her mind. Her loud voice wasn’t that clamorous. Thanks to the lesbians around her, she could feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span> as she wasn’t a pain in the bum anymore. Their nasty voices even arouse her doubly. Furthermore, she got another play to use as a reference. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As she was close to her climax, Aoi got up from Jesse’s lap and made him rest his back on the couch while she climbed up to the backrest. She then spread her legs and stuffed Jesse’s mouth between her beaver, where he could give the last </span>
  <em>
    <span>intense </span>
  </em>
  <span>touch before she came. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Shit, you’re tasty," Jesse giggled, enjoying every thick liquid of hers on the tip of his lips as he didn't want to leave any of it, even just for a drop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was one hell of an incredibly pleasurable night for Aoi, who had used to long for vanilla play for so long. She didn’t know that being adventurous would be this thrilling. A lot of nasty ideas came to her mind to be prepared for their next play in the near future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You all girls were hot!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the meantime, Juri was on the other side of the muddled spot of the club, where he was down to the ground as prey. All his intimate parts were titillated by all the chicks all over him. His mouth, his nipples, his genitals Every part that could be apportioned had its own hotshot. And when he got his greatest zest, his body started twitching in his bones. He even laughed at himself at the time he realized his body was that </span>
  <em>
    <span>naive</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The endless rhythm of tempting beats makes the intimacy of this impurity erotica atmosphere increase. Everywhere possible was flanked by the scent of liquids. Their moans and groans were concealed by the music. A strong lustful desire absolutely runs through their sanity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There’s no sanity. There’s no purity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All they got there was immortality, which was lawbreaking and insane, in a pleasurable way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Haaa… Haaa….,</span>
  </em>
  <span>" Hokuto couldn’t stop panting in festivity. His fresh reddish cheeks looked so angelic in Runa’s eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She then cupped his chin, bill and coo him. "....how did it feel?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Mixed blessing, I guess?" he answered. Runa seemed to be nosy as he found Hokuto was clearly enjoying the vice, but his mouth was saying the reverse. ".....This is the first time I felt uncontrollable," </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Was it worth taking into account?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Surely</span>
  </em>
  <span> there won't be the second time!" he replied in less than no time. "I like being in control. And I’m not sharing my </span>
