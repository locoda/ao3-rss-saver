<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“You are a sick man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto doesn’t answer. Not when the man across him looked at him like the stubborn dirt on his soles, curling his lip in such a way he was both amused and repulsed. He didn’t have the privilege to open his mouth at times like these. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kyomoto Taiga’s amiable facade always vanished when the doors were locked and he was face to face with none other than his loyal dog. It was a shame he hadn’t trained him enough. He’d have to tighten his leash before he inadvertently foiled any more of his plans. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eleven.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kyomoto’s voice was quiet. He never raised his voice when there was no need to, but even the most unintelligent man out there could pick up his displeasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You killed eleven. One of them a child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A cutting glare and a faint quirk of his lips. Hokuto doesn’t flinch being at the end of it. He knew Kyomoto didn’t care about the number or the demographics. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto holds his stance despite the light footsteps coming his way. The few centimeters difference in height held no bearing on Kyomoto’s sheer presence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you think you were protecting me while making a move without my permission?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If only Hokuto had witnessed his utter distaste when the news reached his quarters. The Kyomoto heir was informed of bloodshed from the Sugimoto faction from a one-man ambush killing eleven, and the second he heard of it, Kyomoto had a hunch who was behind it. There were only a few within them who knew of the Sugimoto’s conspiracy to sever their ties. When a sly rat came to deliver the news that they were absorbed by the rival Yamaguchi group, Kyomoto knew he had to dispose of them. The dumbfounded silence throughout the halls in the aftermath would have been amusing to Kyomoto if he hadn’t been reminded that he’d have to recalculate his strategy to decimate the Sugimoto’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kyomoto hated it when the turn of events was out of his control. The heavy iron scent that filled Kyomoto’s nose when Hokuto came back to him the next morning almost made him laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto steeled himself, deluding himself of his conviction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I was right.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto might as well have been digging his own grave for speaking back. Kyomoto wasn’t known to have a short fuse; in fact, he was quite the opposite, and it made him more frightening. Anger hung in the air like a tight rope coiling around Hokuto’s neck. But there was something mixed in it that Hokuto couldn’t put his finger on.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If they had not been finished, then there would be more to lose,” Hokuto continued, maintaining a steady tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then so be it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s eyes widened at the curt response. It was daunting how he had said it without a hint of hesitation. Indeed, Hokuto was right that stalling could cause more potential casualties on Kyomoto’s side, but the young heir didn’t care for that now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I will retaliate when I want to.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>None of this is for you to decide</span>
</em>
<span>, was strongly implied behind his words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The gap between them was closed as Kyomoto grabbed a handful of Hokuto’s shirt, forcing him to meet his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How many times do I have to tell you? You </span>
<em>
<span>can’t </span>
</em>
<span>protect me,” Kyomoto snarled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no doubt Kyomoto was strong on his own. Hokuto never questioned his abilities, especially when he saw the outcome of everything after the cogs in Kyomoto’s head started running. Maybe it was naive of Hokuto to think Kyomoto would care about his clan, but he stood his ground in that he would get rid of anything that was a potential threat to the man he served. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My purpose is you. Nothing else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto was well aware that he was nothing but a pawn in Kyomoto’s complex chessboard. Hokuto could never read him. There were times he came across as a man abusing his power, and there were times he was nonchalant despite the world they lived in. Hokuto could never read his intentions. But there was one thing for certain, and it was that Hokuto lived for Kyomoto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He would kill for him. He would die for him if he found it necessary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If going against his word to protect him would be Hokuto’s downfall, then so be it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At his silent defiance, Kyomoto looked at him long and silent. Then the hand on Hokuto’s shirt let go to push the man down to his knees, and a taunting smirk graced his lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then serve your purpose to me right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A smooth finger traced the sharpness of Hokuto's jaw, and Hokuto knew what he meant. He could never deny him nor defy him when it came to this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The glint from Kyomoto’s eyes looking down at him as he uttered his command prompted Hokuto’s hands to move. He unbuckles the belt in front of him with deft hands, pulling his slacks down to hang on his thighs as he frees his cock from its constraints. He was already slightly hard. Hokuto had confirmed long before that Kyomoto’s lust was fueled when it was time to put Hokuto in his place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t anger me again, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Both of them knew he couldn’t promise that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto touches him directly, stroking him into full hardness, and the act itself added to the heat of Kyomoto’s stare has Hokuto pressing his thighs together. The tip of his cock disappears into Hokuto’s mouth, and he lavishes him with attention from his tongue, swirling small circles and huffing hot breath until his heady taste coated his tongue. Kyomoto breathed deeply and threw his head back, his cock red and pulsing in Hokuto’s hand and mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was one of the few moments Hokuto felt he had a semblance of power over Kyomoto, but even then, he was nothing more than a mere puppet held on strings working to feed his urges. </span>
