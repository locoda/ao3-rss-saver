<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This work has been such a rollercoaster for me - but most of all, it's been FUN to write. I really really really want to make everyone more aware of polyamory and emphasize how all people have their own ways of dealing with relationships. As long as everyone's happy, that's what matters. Poly!Juri is now my comfort character, and he can lead the way showing everyone in this world how communication is sexy.</p><p>Thank you Laura &amp; Riikka for being my emotional support for this fic!

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"You're gonna be late if you don't hurry up," Shintaro comments through a mouthful of a toothbrush, smirking as he watches Juri rummaging through his bag in the foyer. Leaning against the doorway, Shintaro splits his attention between his morning ritual and the scene before him.</p><p>Juri shoots back a sheepish grin. "Mornings aren't my thing, you know that very well."</p><p>He finally locates his keys in the bag. However, a mental lightbulb flickers suddenly as he realizes his spare battery is still charging on the kitchen table. He doesn't think twice about kicking off his shoes, making a quick dash back inside to grab the battery before stuffing it into his overnight bag.</p><p>Shintaro's voice echoes from the bathroom. "What time is the company party, by the way?" The sound of spitting and gargling follows.</p><p>Juri rolls his eyes, a weary sigh leaving his lips as he slips back into his shoes and throws the bag over his shoulder. "We've got a restaurant thing at seven. I'm just not feeling it, honestly. The week's been a marathon. And you know how these dinners go – they're never just dinners. The boss was talking about some afterparty stuff too. I might figure a way out of that, at least."</p><p>Shintaro laughs. "You say that every time, and then you end up having time of your life, coming home on the first train in the morning," he teases, rejoining Juri in the foyer with a small towel in his hands. He dabs at his mouth, his grin playful. "By the way, I'll be back on Sunday sometime in the afternoon, probably around two. Let's stay in touch if we're up for dinner and do the grocery shopping in the evening?"</p><p>Just as Juri begins questioning their dog, Shelly, Shintaro guesses his thoughts. "Oh, and don't stress about Shelly," he says. "I'll take her to the dog hotel before I leave and pick her up on Monday after work, so you won't have to worry about that."</p><p>"Sure thing."</p><p>Juri kneels down to scratch Shelly's ear. "Bye, Shelly. Be a good girl while we are away," he says with a warm smile. Shelly wags her tail in response as if understanding the words, and then Juri stands up to bid his boyfriend farewell once more. "Okay, I'll shoot you a text later. Enjoy the beach!"</p><p>"Enjoy the party. Now hurry up, baby," Shintaro grins, leaning in to plant a gentle kiss on Juri's lips before playfully slapping his butt. Within that, they're off for their Fridays of their own.</p><p>No more than twelve hours later, Juri must admit that Shintaro was right. Again. When their boss announces it's time to move to the karaoke, Juri is already drunk and the first one to lead the way with Daiki, Fuma, and Shoki, shouting with the utmost confidence that they should definitely go to the place where he can get the discount. The beer and sake have made his head soft. He fishes his mobile phone out of his pocket and takes a few candid selfies with Fuma and Shoki. He chooses the last picture from his camera roll abruptly.</p><p>
<em>karaoke!!!!!!<br/>
crazyyyyyyy</em>
</p><p>Juri wobbly types the text with the picture, hits the "Send" button and sends the message first to Jesse and then to Shintaro. Jesse answers immediately with a surprised-looking shiba dog sticker and a couple of messages.</p><p>
<em>Hahaha<br/>
Where are you???<br/>
Don't forget our lunch date tomorrow!! ^^</em>
</p><p>Not much later, Shintaro reacts to the picture with a heart and sends back a blurred shot of beer bottles and some food on the table. Juri manages to like Shintaro's message with a thumbs-up reaction.</p><p>The karaoke goes on. Songs come after another, and each one of them is funnier to sing together, or more like shout together in unison. Daiki is ordering more and more beer in pitchers, pouring more into their glasses, and no one even tries to reject the offer. Only after a while, Juri really needs to pee, and he excuses himself, the bright corridor light almost blinding him as he wobbles to the toilet.</p><p>In the silence of the toilet, he realizes how drunk he really is. His head feels light and his mood is happy.</p><p>"Fuuuuuck," Juri grumbles to himself from relief as he does his business and throws his head back. He closes his eyes, a grin tugging at the corners of his lips as the good feeling hits him: attending the afterparty was a brilliant decision.</p><p>After washing his hands and when he is about to step back into the chorus of laughter and song, the toilet door swings open with a force that nearly collides with him. Reflexively, Juri jumps back, narrowly avoiding the hit.</p><p>"Ouch, sorry!"</p><p>Seeing a face behind the voice, Juri realizes the person is one of the guys from their sister company from Yokohama. A face he glimpsed at a separate table during their earlier restaurant gathering. And now he's been sitting at the other side of the long karaoke bench, so they haven't had any chance to chat. Yet.</p><p>"Ah, no worries. I'm no stranger to a little close encounter," Juri quips with a flirtatious grin.</p><p>As he passes by the guy, he can't resist winking at him. After all, he can't help but appreciate the guy's good looks.</p><p>Once the guy follows a bit later and returns to the room, Juri pays closer attention to him. The guy's facial features are very noble, and his black hair is neatly combed to the sides, showing his forehead. The tie around his neck has been loosened, and the first open buttons reveal some pale skin.</p><p>Throughout the karaoke, Juri ends up finding himself drawn to stealing glances at the guy seated on the opposite side of the room. A song after song, something strange pulls Juri's gaze towards the guy, his eyes lingering a moment longer each time they lock onto his deliciously lean form. The guy seems flustered when he meets Juri's eyes for the first time, quickly turning his glance away to the TV screen in front and pretending he didn't see anything.</p><p>At some point, the guy is handed a microphone and sings a song from Mr. Children that occasionally sways only a bit off-key, maybe due to his drunken state, but he still owns every moment.</p><p>Once again, Juri can't help paying attention and appreciating the guy's delicious neckline when he lets out the last high notes, throwing his head back. How unfair is it that some are so good-looking and have a good voice even when drunk? Juri whistles at him through the applause, and the guy looks pleased.</p><p>"Hey, idiots aside! I'll go next; that's my song!" Daiki declares through the chatter and snatches the microphone. Watanabe chimes in, voicing his desire to participate in the song, prompting a shuffling of seats. Juri finds himself sitting next to the handsome guy, their shoulders brushing against each other. Suddenly, it feels considerably warmer everywhere than it did when he was sitting next to their new office manager Kato, who Watanabe insists is the cutest person on Earth - at least in his heterosexual opinion.</p><p>Daiki and Watanabe sing their song, the others joining them. Juri's not familiar with that one, so he just sips his beer and watches his colleagues swaying in sync, arms intertwined. In the middle of the song, the guy leans in, his hot breath tickling Juri's ear.</p><p>"I'm Kyomoto Taiga, by the way."</p><p>"Tanaka. Tanaka Juri."</p><p>They jingle their glasses.</p><p>"Most of my colleagues of the same age call me Kyomo, though. Anyway, whatever suits you."</p><p>"Okay, cool."</p><p>As the next song comes and everyone's attention is on Fuma, who has tied his tie ridiculously around his forehead (a clear indicator of the party's progression), Juri moves his hand behind Taiga's back. Taiga glances at him quickly in a way that Juri can only take as a yes. He fishes his hand inside Taiga's pants, finds the waistband of his underwear, and slips his hand a bit lower under that. His hand rests there, Juri's middle finger hovering the skin just above a point where the tailbone would end.</p><p>Juri's keen senses pick up on the subtle shifts in Taiga's body language. He notices Taiga tensing up, a barely perceptible change in his posture as he wiggles ever so slightly in his seat next to Juri. Then, his gaze narrows in on Taiga's throat, where Juri observes the unmistakable bobbing of Adam's apple.</p><p>They stay like that until the time comes to bid the karaoke joint farewell. As they all stumble out of their room, Taiga takes a step back, holding the door open for Juri, who's the last one to exit. Juri is about to step outside when he feels a playful pinch on his backside. He turns, a playful smirk curving his lips as he meets Taiga's mischievous gaze. What a tease.</p><p>Once they have set the bill, they finally stand on the street. They halt a taxi for their boss, who, before stepping in, offers well wishes for the weekend before the vehicle whisks him away into the night. Taiga shows no signs of leaving but stands beside Juri as they watch Daiki dragging Fuma and Shoki to the next cab.</p><p>"Are you two coming or staying?" Daiki's words hang in the air, and Juri's gaze instinctively turns to Taiga, who raises his eyebrow. Okay, fine.</p><p>"There's a hotel in Dogenzaka. We could steal a couple of hours there," Juri proposes.</p><p>"Whatever!" Daiki laughs, waving his hand before hopping inside the cab. "Have a blast!</p><p>In the hotel room, Juri sheds his jacket, carelessly discarding it somewhere on the floor. Then he pushes Taiga into bed and starts tearing his white shirt off impatiently before kissing him hungrily. Taiga grabs his shirt back and shoves his tongue into Juri's mouth. It's messy, wet, and not gracious at all, their teeth colliding. Taiga wraps his legs around Juri's waist and, with the help of that position, aggressively rubs his lower body against Juri's.</p><p>It's too much, and it's not enough.</p><p>Juri stands up, wobbling slightly as his stability is not in its best state; he takes all his clothes off and throws them at his feet on the sticky floor. Meanwhile, on the bed, Taiga manages to undress himself. He beckons Juri to return to bed by opening his arms, his arousal visible with a dick already hard against his stomach. He looks so tempting, so delicious. Juri wants to eat him. He wants to fuck him more than anything.</p><p>"Wait," Juri mumbles and turns around for a table underneath the big mirror facing the bed. He kneels down, opens the closet next to the minibar, and fishes out a disposable foil package of lube and one condom. He keeps them in his hand as he returns to bed and falls down on Taiga, kissing him again.</p><p>As the kiss deepens, Taiga's hands begin to venture lower, their wandering fingers exploring the contours of Juri's body with a burning hunger. The journey of his touch descends until they reach the firm, inviting curve of Juri's buttocks. Taiga's grip tightens, his fingers digging into the supple flesh, evoking an involuntary gasp from Juri, their mouths still fused together.</p><p>Then Juri's hand dips lower, between their bodies, and his hand finds Taiga's cock. He wraps his fingers around it and starts pumping it at a rugged pace. Taiga hisses but doesn't let out a more robust sound, only heavy breathing following up. <em>He looked like he'd be louder in bed</em>, Juri catches himself thinking briefly.</p><p>All the while, Juri continues his rhythmic ministrations, his hand steadily stroking Taiga's cock.</p><p>Juri raises his free hand to caress Taiga's face. His fingers trace messy lines of Taiga's jaw, feeling the subtlest rise and fall of his lower lip. Then he presses his lips against Taiga's neck, nibbling the thin skin as he keeps jerking him. He wants more. This is not enough.</p><p>A subtle tap on Juri's wrist halts the fervent stroking, and Juri withdraws his hand. With a graceful transition, Juri rises, his knees providing a steady foundation. Taiga seizes the opportunity and carefully shifts their positions, turning around on his knees before Juri, his head resting on his arms that cradle the pillow.</p><p>In this new arrangement, Juri finds himself with an unobstructed view of Taiga's inviting form, his gaze lingering on the enticing sight before him. His lips moisten in anticipation as his eye traces the contours of Taiga's form.</p><p>He moves in closer, positioning himself behind Taiga. With a deft motion, he tears the foil package open and dips two fingers inside it. Coated with a generous amount of lube, he doesn't hesitate as he hovers them near Taiga's entrance. "I'm going to finger you now," Juri groans, his voice heavy with desire. "And then, I'm going to fuck you."</p><p>"Okay, okay," Taiga responds hastily.</p><p>The room fills with a slick, squelching sound as Juri's fingers work inside Taiga, pressing first in and then moving them in and out. Once he feels Taiga is open enough, Juri removes his fingers and reaches for the condom. He deftly rips the package open and rolls it onto his hardened cock. With a firm grip on Taiga's hip, he guides himself inside. He slams into him, overstimulated, and it feels so hot and tight at the same time.</p><p>Juri fucks him like he will die if he doesn't. Though Taiga tries to sync his movements with Juri's, they keep slipping out of rhythm, resulting in clumsiness. Juri, in his drunk state, already senses that he won't reach climax easily. He pats Taiga's buttock, beckoning him to switch positions. His cock slips out of Taiga's ass, and Taiga turns around on his back.</p><p>Juri deftly maneuvers Taiga's legs around his waist, hoisting him onto his shoulders, and resumes thrusting vigorously. He has to shut his eyes, channeling all his focus into the incredible tightness enveloping him.</p><p>A few minutes pass, and abruptly, Juri seizes up, his back arching as he bites down hard on his lower lip. Panting heavily, Taiga eagerly reaches out to explore every reachable inch of Juri's skin while jerking himself off. Yet, Juri's sensations are somewhat dulled as he continues to shudder again and again. Until he finally manages to release himself completely, succumbing to a languid and satisfying orgasm.</p><p>Exhausted and thoroughly spent, Juri collapses onto the mattress beside Taiga, a wave of relaxation washing over him. As he catches his breath, he becomes aware that his stomach is slick with traces of semen. Taiga must have reached his own climax somewhere along the way, but in the haze of the ecstasy, Juri didn't notice it happening.</p><p>His entire body feels languid, every muscle and joint tingling with the aftermath of the sex. Despite the fatigue, a contented smile plays on his lips as he turns to face Taiga. With a random tender affection, Taiga cups Juri's cheek, his fingers gentle against Juri's heated skin.</p><p>They exchange a brief, somewhat goofy grin, fully aware of the situation – a boozy one-night stand, free of strings or serious intentions.</p><p>After an extended silence filled with mumbled giggles and hiccups, Taiga breaks it with an almost comically slurred voice, "Well, that... that was nice. You're a good fuck, Tanaka."</p><p>Juri, words slightly slurred, too, lets out a drunken chuckle. "Yeah, it sure was. Sorry, I had difficulties to come. The booze, you know."</p><p>Soon, with a mumbled agreement, they decide it's time to clean up. Juri first staggers to his feet, giggling at his own clumsiness, and heads to the bathroom to take a shower. The warm water helps clear his head somewhat, but he's still far from sober.</p><p>After Taiga has showered, they reconvene in the bedroom, both wrapped in towels. Juri, his hair tousled and his eyes still glazed, looks at Taiga with a half-smile. "So, Kyomoto, are we in a hurry?"</p><p>Taiga, his cheeks flushed from the heat of the shower and the alcohol still clearly coursing through his veins, shakes his head slowly. "Nah, not at all."</p><p>Juri grins, his previous confidence returning. "Good. How about we sleep here for a few hours, and maybe, just maybe," he connives playfully, "we have a round two in the morning?"</p><p>Taiga, his towel slipping slightly as he raises an eyebrow, smirks back. "I've got nothing against that plan."</p><p>Juri yawns, and they kiss before they slide beneath the same cover. Taiga drapes his arm around Juri, who isn't typically one for cuddling during sleep. However, tonight, he's willing to make an exception because he's too tired to protest. Juri falls asleep, or more like passes out, quickly.</p><p>When the soft morning light filters through the curtains, Juri stirs, his head throbbing with the telltale signs of a hangover. For a moment, he has to recall where he is and how he ended up there. He slowly blinks his eyes open, groaning softly, and looks at the man lying beside him. Taiga. Who is still asleep and looks surprisingly peaceful in the serene morning light.</p><p>Groaning again, Juri carefully slips out of bed. He pads over to the minibar, takes out a bottle of water, and empties it with a few thirsty gulps. He curses himself for not packing some painkillers but doesn't want to wake Taiga just yet by foraging through the whole room in order to find some medicine. So, he gives up and decides maybe he just needs to suffer his headache for a while. At least he got his water.</p><p>Juri searches through the pile of his clothes across the floor until he finds his phone. Glancing at the battery icon, he sees that it's less than 20%, but he can't be bothered to search for the spare battery. He crawls back into bed and starts texting Shintaro, noticing he's online. Juri can picture Shintaro doing the same thing right now—snuggled in bed, cocooned in a duvet, scrolling through the latest social media updates and sites before even considering getting up.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Amusement dances in Juri's eyes as he flashes a soft smile at the messages. But in his hungover state, an unexpected desire to cozy up to someone suddenly overtakes him. Luckily he's currently sharing a bed with an attractive man who he already fucked last night. Without hesitation, Juri snuggles up close to his bedmate and secretly hopes he's not smelling too bad.</p><p>His hand can't resist fondling Taiga's pert butt, eliciting a sleepy murmur from the man.</p><p>Chuckling softly, Juri leans in closer, his lips hovering near Taiga's ear.</p><p>"Hey," he whispers.</p><p>"Mmmmm," Taiga mutters and turns his side to face Juri, fluttering eyelids open.</p><p>"I had a great time last night. You know, I'd be more than happy to tap that again sometime in the future."</p><p>Taiga, still half-asleep, scoffs playfully. "You're quite the charmer," he mutters. He reaches for his phone on the nightstand and opens it. "Here," he says, handing it to Juri. "Add yourself on LINE."</p><p>Juri takes the phone, swiftly adds his contact information, creates a new conversation, and cheekily names it <em>'Good Fuck'</em>. With a mischievous smile, he hands the phone back to Taiga. "There you go. Now we won't lose touch." One more time, he snuggles closer to Taiga and fondles his butt.</p><p>"You're really into cuddling and into, uh, asses, aren't you?" Taiga mutters amusedly, yawning and wrapping an arm around Juri.</p><p>Juri laughs, unapologetic. "Can't help it. Some people are into pretty eyes, some like cute smiles, and some prefer big boobs. I just happen to appreciate a nice behind."</p><p>Taiga chuckles in response. "Fair enough."</p><p>They are ready to check out when they've finally managed to wake up properly, freshen up, and pack everything. Taiga politely settles the bill with his card, presenting it to the most disinterested receptionist they've ever seen. Meanwhile, Juri delves into his wallet and retrieves 3000 yen, handing it to Taiga.</p><p>"Thanks for the good time," Taiga wishes as they step outside the building. He gestures towards the nearby crossing. "I'll take a train from there."</p><p>"Great, catch you later," Juri replies.</p><p>As Taiga begins to walk away, Juri can't resist calling out to him one last time. "By the way, your ass looks incredible from this angle!" he lets out a cheeky whistle, earning a seductive smile from Taiga before they finally part ways.</p><p>Feeling the weight of a hangover, Juri realizes that he's not too far from Harajuku. The prospect of a brisk walk and some fresh air to clear his head seems suddenly enticing. He strolls through the bustling street, where Harajuku is already living up to its reputation as a place to be on weekends. There are lots of shop owners opening their shops, and Juri can see more crowds of people getting packed together.</p><p>Juri's head is pounding, and the promise of fresh air isn't quite as appealing now that he's outside because there are way too many sounds everywhere. He remembers that his friend Akito's shop isn't too far from his current location and decides it might be a good idea to seek some refuge there for a while.</p><p>He pushes through the door to Akito's shop, a quaint little place tucked away in a side alley. The soft chime of a bell announces Juri's arrival, and Akito looks up from behind the counter.</p><p>"Welcome—oh, well, hello, sunshine," Akito says, raising an eyebrow as he takes in Juri's disheveled appearance. "You don't look like you're coming from a good night's sleep."</p><p>Juri lets out a sigh, rubbing his temples as if that might relieve the growing headache. "Yeah, tell me about it."</p><p>Akito gestures for him to sit on the couch, and Juri gratefully sinks into the comfortable cushions. Akito returns with a glass of water just as another customer walks in.</p><p>Juri takes a sip of water, fishes his phone out of his pocket, and opens Grindr, idly scrolling through profiles while Akito helps the customer by introducing their latest model. After Akito's done and the customer is gone, he plops down next to Juri and leans in to see the screen.</p><p>"Boring, no, bad profile text, no, no, ugh, NO," Akito mutters, his commentary growing increasingly critical. "What's that hair? Okay, please, no." He shakes his head and sighs. "Grindr is the worst. You never find good guys there."</p><p>Juri chuckles weakly, grateful for the distraction because where's the lie, really. Grindr is the worst. "Yeah, tell me about it," he agrees.</p><p>Akito nudges him playfully. "We should go to Nichome again sometime soon. At least there, you can meet real people, not just profiles."</p><p>Juri nods, the idea of real human interaction sounding more appealing by the second. "Yeah, let's do that." He puts the phone back in his pocket and stretches. He lets his head fall against the headrest and closes his eyes. "I could fall asleep here."</p><p>"Which you're not going to do because I don't want you to scare my customers away," Akito chimes. He stands up quickly as the door swings open again, and a couple of girls enter.</p><p>As Juri remains seated for a while, his gaze blankly fixed on nothing in particular, he gradually becomes aware of the increasing hustle and bustle in the shop. More customers come and go, and it looks like Akito is getting busier by the minute.</p><p>When he eventually stands up and passes by Akito, who is now manning the cashier with a focused expression, Juri leans in. "I'll see you around, buddy," he bids goodbye.</p><p>Akito nods hastily, a hint of a smile breaking through his busy demeanor. "Sure thing. We'll grab dinner and hit Nichome soon, alright?"</p><p>Juri grins and gives a thumbs-up before stepping out of the shop.</p><p>While walking towards the station, Juri takes out his phone again and, this time, texts Jesse about their lunch date, ensuring the plans are still on track.</p><p>They meet at a little curry restaurant near Jesse's apartment in Ebisu. As they settle into their seats, the aroma of spices and simmering curry fills the air, and to be honest, it's not doing the best for Juri's current condition.</p><p>"I think my stomach's also rebelling today," he finally admits, poking at the plate that's been served in front of him. His appetite is suddenly gone, although he felt starving a moment before. "I really might have overdone it last night."</p><p>Jesse raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. He also looks like he's physically totally fine, not a hint of hangover on that face, that bastard. "So about the last night," Jesse starts, leaning in, eager to hear the whole story. "Tell me all the details. Did Fuma pass out before ten? Did Watanabe make his move on that office manager finally?"</p><p>"Regrettably, no and no," Juri replies. "But I did manage to hit on a guy there. Or maybe he managed to hit on me. Depends on whom you ask, I guess. And it's all a bit hazy now."</p><p>"Ooh, please tell me you didn't get banged by him there at the karaoke joint, and you got yourself kicked out..." Jesse begins, a touch of admiration creeping into his tone. As always, Jesse loves adventures and epic stories, especially when people do their best to create them.</p><p>Juri laughs, shaking his head. "No, no, not at karaoke," he clarifies quickly. "But after we left, we ended up at a love hotel. And then I fucked him."</p><p>Jesse bursts into hearty laughter, clapping his hands in amusement. "A one-night stand with a colleague at a love hotel after karaoke? That's positively classic! Are you sure you're not secretly leading a double life as a straight guy in his fifties?"</p><p>Juri grimaces at him.</p><p>"Anyway," Jesse continues as he's taken a bite of his bread, "I bet you need some relaxation then. We all know you're horny as a rabbit when you're having a hangover."</p><p>Juri sips his drink. "I was hoping you'd propose that."</p><p>Jesse winks. "That's why I suggested this place, so we can crash at my place."</p><p>Not more than 30 minutes later, Juri finds himself in Jesse's bed naked. Jesse tightens the straps around Juri's wrists and blindfolds him.</p><p>Jesse was right - Juri feels overly sensitive, especially when he's having a hangover. Every brush of Jesse's fingers along his abdomen sends shivers cascading down his spine, causing his back to arch involuntarily and his toes to tingle with anticipation. He's already rock hard, the mere idea of Jesse tending to his desires driving him to a state of heightened arousal that began before he even removed all his clothes.</p><p>As Jesse's expert touch moves to his throbbing member, Juri can't help but let out a soft moan. Jesse's reassuring voice soothes him, urging him to surrender to the pleasure. "It's all about you, darling. Just relax and enjoy," Jesse murmurs.</p><p>Juri listens intently, curiosity mingling with anticipation as he hears Jesse making preparations nearby. The suspense heightens his arousal, and Juri can't help but wonder what Jesse has in store for him this time. Moments later, he feels a pillow being placed beneath his hips, and the sensation of the tip of something smooth and cool pressing against his entrance makes excitement race through his whole body.</p><p>"Aaaaaah," Juri groans and twitches his whole body violently, but his wrists are still leashed against the headboard, so he can't move much. It's an intense blend of pleasure and pain, and he senses that his orgasm is already approaching rapidly. Jesse needs to act quickly if he wants to avoid Juri reaching that point too soon.</p><p>Jesse carefully adjusts the settings, pressing buttons on the toy until it springs to life, the vibrations coursing through Juri's body. Jesse experiments, cycling through various rhythms, until he lands on Juri's favorite—a tantalizing sequence of irregular pulses. These pulses start languidly before quickening every second, building up to a powerful climax before looping back to the beginning. The changing tempo keeps Juri on the edge of pleasure, aching for release.</p><p>When Juri has relaxed more, Jesse pushes the vibrator further inside him, stretching him with a broader part of the toy, and starts fucking him properly with it. Juri moans, and it gets even louder as Jesse suddenly brings his face closer to Juri's crotch, blowing hot breath against Juri's cock.</p><p>"You look so fucking hot like this," Jesse compliments him, driving Juri even crazier with his words. "I could eat you whole."</p><p>With deliberate intent, Jesse takes Juri into his mouth, his tongue dancing along the pulsating length of Juri's cock. The simultaneous sensations of the vibrator penetrating him and Jesse's skillful mouth sucking him leave Juri teetering on the brink of ecstasy, his loud cries of pleasure filling the room.</p><p>As the sensations intensify, Juri's body tenses, and his orgasm approaches. In a breathtaking crescendo of pleasure, he succumbs to the powerful release, a deep, guttural groan escaping deep from his throat as waves of ecstasy wash over him, leaving him breathless and trembling in the aftermath. He lets out a content sigh.</p><p>With the moment's intensity slowly ebbing away, Juri's blissful reverie is interrupted by a sudden cramp in his toe. "Ouch ouch ouch ouch," he lets out a pained whine, prompting Jesse to quickly massage his aching foot. Jesse takes the cue and swiftly rubs the sore spot, fondling Juri's whole foot in his warm hands and returning some circulation to his toes.</p><p>Soon, the blindfold and the straps are gently removed, and they watch each other. Without hesitation, their lips meet in a deep, warm, hungry kiss. It may be their first kiss of the day, but it's almost a perfect one.</p><p>Jesse's warm eyes fix on Juri. "Feeling better now?"</p><p>"What if I said no?" Juri teases, his lips curving into a mischievous smile.</p><p>In response, Jesse leans in for another sweet kiss, a wordless reassurance of his affection. Juri smiles again when their lips part. "Thank you. I think I just had a perfect lunch date," he utters softly.</p><p>Later, when Jesse disappears into the bathroom to freshen up, Juri takes the opportunity to tidy up the small kitchenette. He glances at the dishes in the sink, deciding to lend a hand with the cleanup. Grabbing a dishcloth, he starts washing the dishes.</p><p>When Jesse returns to the living area, he spots Juri at the sink, and his eyes widen in surprise. "Aww, you did my dishes?" he exclaims, clearly touched.</p><p>Juri chuckles. "Well, I couldn't leave your kitchen looking like a war zone, now could I?"</p><p>Jesse joins him, and as they dry and put away the last of the dishes, Juri turns to Jesse with a curious glint in his eye. "So, what's your plan for the rest of the weekend? Since you mentioned something about your family and that you could only catch up during lunchtime?"</p><p>Jesse nods, a grin spreading across his face. "Yeah, it's Labor Day weekend in the States, so I'm going camping with my family. It's sort of a tradition. Sleeping in a tent, barbecuing with limited kitchen supplies, dad telling lame jokes, and my sister complaining she would rather be at home. The usual."</p><p>"You Americans and your weird holidays. But I'm jealous you get double celebrations throughout the year," Juri says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Jesse laughs at the comment. "Well, sometimes it's nice, but other times it's a bit too much! Like when my dad insists on having a family Christmas, and my mom wants to celebrate New Year's separately."</p><p>Juri can't help but join in the laughter. "Sounds like you've got quite the holiday juggling act on your hands. Have fun camping, though. It sounds like a great way to spend the rest of the weekend."</p><p>As the time to part ways approaches, Juri and Jesse find themselves at the door, lingering for a moment longer.</p><p>"Hey, are you free on Tuesday?" Juri asks as he steps into his shoes.</p><p>Jesse furrows his brows for a moment, thinking. "Hmm, Tuesday... I have a training session with my personal trainer that day, sorry."</p><p>Juri nods, understanding. "No problem. What about Wednesday?"</p><p>Jesse grins, looking a bit more hopeful this time. "Wednesday works for me. What do you have in mind?"</p><p>Juri hesitates for a moment before a sheepish smile crosses his lips. "Actually, I have a Mario Kart lan party scheduled for that evening with Shoki, Yasui, and Shintaro. I totally forgot. So it might not work out because I have work before that. As usual."</p><p>Jesse chuckles. "No worries. Sounds like you have nice plans ahead, anyway! Well, how about the weekend then?"</p><p>Juri starts to nod in agreement, but then Jesse's eyes widen with realization, "Oh wait, I just remembered, I already have plans for the weekend as well," Jesse says, scratching his head.</p><p>They can only share a laugh at the comedic exchange of scheduling conflicts. Talk about the quirks of adult life.</p><p>"Looks like we're both pretty booked, huh?" Jesse then remarks.</p><p>Juri hums, appreciating the humor of it all. "Indeed. But don't worry, we'll work it out. Just text me when you're free, and we'll make plans."</p><p>"Deal," Jesse agrees, capturing the collar of Juri's jacket and leaning in for a quick goodbye kiss. "Catch you later, lunch-boyfriend."</p><p>After reaching Shinjuku, Juri realizes all the noise and lights are still too much for him, so he decides to spend a couple of hours in a manga café. He slips into one of the cubicles, relishing the comforting silence. The only sounds are the faint rustle of pages, the muted hum of computers, and the distant tapping of keyboards from other cubicles.</p><p>Juri sips on an energy drink to stave off the drowsiness that clings to him. The caffeine jolts through his system, briefly revitalizing him. He immerses himself in the world of manga, losing track of time as he flips through the pages.</p><p>Somewhere in the midst of his reading, he decides to shoot a message to the group chat with Shoki and Fuma.</p><p><em>OH MY GOD<br/>
this plottwist???????? insane!</em> he texts, his fingers excitedly flying over the phone keyboard.</p><p>As he awaits his friends' responses or reactions, he glances at the time in the corner of his phone screen and realizes it's getting late. He sends a quick message to Hokuto, inquiring about his schedule.</p><p><em>hey what time will you be back?</em> he types.</p><p>Hokuto's reply is a rather lengthy one, beginning with musings about his day at work, followed by a detailed account of his grocery shopping. Juri can't help but roll his eyes; Hokuto always manages to turn a simple question into a lengthy discourse about something totally irrelevant. He scoffs softly at the message, amused by his boyfriend's tendency to lose track of the point mid-message.</p><p><em>should be back around eight</em> is what Hokuto's message finally concludes.</p><p>After checking the time, Juri decides he's far too exhausted to move anywhere else for the rest of the day. He's determined to finish one more book and thinks it's a great idea to extend his time at the manga café just a bit longer so he can escape straight to Hokuto's place later.</p><p>In the meantime, he keeps up with his chats, hearing about Fuma and Shoki's disastrous taxi journey back home last night and how they had to stop at least three times because Fuma wasn't feeling too well. The two eventually inquire about Juri's night with Taiga, and he replies with a nonchalant <em>oh, it was just fine!</em>. There's no need to go into all the juicy details and share someone's intimate stuff with his friends, especially since Taiga isn't just a random guy with no name or face to them, but they actually know his identity.</p><p>Juri finally wraps up his cozy time at the manga cafe and heads to the train station, grumbling mentally about Saturdays and their annoying crowds. He can't help but daydream about a future where he's so rich he can simply take a taxi whenever he pleases. Perhaps then, he and Shintaro could also afford an apartment somewhere other than Chiba. Maybe then they could even own a real house with a small yard.</p><p>When Juri finally arrives at Hokuto's home station, he decides to make a quick stop at a convenience store. He purchases two bottles of Hokuto's favorite tea and some cup noodles for himself, well aware of the mental nagging that Jesse would provide about the nutritional value of his choices. That guy is so into the gym and bulking himself these days. Which Juri doesn't mind when he gets to enjoy the results of that bulked body in bed, but still.</p><p>As Hokuto swings the door open, Juri's senses are instantly flooded with familiarity—the scent of Hokuto's apartment, the soft glow of the welcoming light spilling into the hallway, the comforting presence of someone he's been longing to see for far too long. Their work schedules rarely align, with Hokuto's erratic hours and Juri's fixed eight-to-five grind.</p><p>The moment Juri steps inside, he sheds his jacket and bags in his hands, letting them fall to the floor with a thud. Without saying a word, he embraces Hokuto, enveloping him in a tight hug. His nose finds its way to Hokuto's neck, and he breathes in deeply, savoring the scent he's craved.</p><p>Hokuto's amused voice breaks the silence, his fingers gently tracing patterns along Juri's back. "I see, I see, you have a hangover," he concludes.</p><p>Juri's grip only tightens, and he nestles himself closer into Hokuto's warmth. "Mmm-hmm," he mumbles, the sound reverberating against Hokuto's skin.</p><p>Hokuto beckons Juri inside, guiding him gently with a hand on his back. "I've prepared something to eat for you," he says warmly.</p><p>Juri raises an eyebrow, feigning surprise. "Aw, you shouldn't have. I came prepared," he says, revealing his convenience store purchases.</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head, a soft smile playing on his lips. They end up sitting peacefully at the table, sharing a meal that Hokuto prepared. Juri listens with rapt attention as Hokuto tells him about his latest movie and latest turnarounds about being on set. Pride swells within Juri, and he can't help but admire how far Hokuto has come in his acting career.</p><p>In turn, Juri regales Hokuto with the story of his day, from the karaoke fun to the afternoon sex at Jesse's. He notices Hokuto's amused smile and wonders if there's a hint of judgment in his gaze, given Hokuto's penchant for routine and order. But then again, Hokuto has never been one to judge others for their choices, and the way his hand finds Juri's and he fondles it, Juri realizes once again, okay, this guy would never judge anyone for what they are.</p><p>After their meal, they retire to Hokuto's cozy living room. Juri settles his head comfortably in Hokuto's lap, finding instant solace in the rhythmic caress of Hokuto's gentle fingers gliding through his hair. Juri is engrossed in his phone, idly swiping through social media, tapping at random posts, and occasionally pausing to read an interesting article or chuckle at a meme.</p><p>Hokuto, in return, is deeply absorbed in his script, eyes scanning lines of dialogue and stage directions. He doesn't stop carding his fingers through Juri's hair while reading, and Juri truly enjoys the moment of simplicity like that.</p><p>The peaceful ambiance lulls them into a comfortable silence. Juri continues to scroll through his phone, his eyelids growing heavy as the minutes slip by. Finally, a yawn escapes his lips, prompting Hokuto to glance at him with a quirked eyebrow.</p><p>"What time is it?" Hokuto inquires softly.</p><p>Juri stifles another yawn and checks his phone. "It's still early," he murmurs, though his drooping eyes betray his weariness.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, but there's a hint of determination in his voice. "Actually, it's midnight. We're going to bed early tonight."</p><p>With a gentle nudge, Hokuto ushers Juri to stand up and towards the bathroom. Hokuto hands Juri his toothbrush, always conveniently kept in the closet. They stand side by side in front of the bathroom mirror, brushing their teeth in companionable silence.</p><p>Once they finish, Hokuto excuses himself to prepare for bed. Juri completes the rest of his nighttime routine in the bathroom before tiptoeing to the bedroom. He climbs into bed, feeling his fatigue catching up with him immediately.</p><p>He's not entirely sure if he briefly already dozed off, but he startles slightly as Hokuto joins him under the covers.</p><p>Hokuto is dressed in boxers and a huge t-shirt adorned with a picture of a cheerful yellow duck. He still wears his glasses but removes them and places them on the nightstand. He reaches over and turns off the lights before pulling Juri into a warm embrace.</p><p>"I know, I know, you don't like cuddling when you sleep," Hokuto whispers reassuringly, his breath tickling Juri's ear. "But I just wanted to wish you a good night."</p><p>Juri smiles softly, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. "Good night," he replies, leaning in to share a gentle, lingering kiss with Hokuto.</p><p>When their lips finally part, Juri turns onto his right side, facing away from Hokuto, and settles into sleep. He falls asleep in a few seconds and doesn't stir until morning comes.</p><p>Juri wakes up to find Hokuto's side of the bed already empty. The distant clatter of plates and mugs emanates from the kitchen, indicating that Hokuto is up and about. Juri stretches and yawns, reaching for his phone on the nightstand. He begins his morning ritual by scrolling through social media, reading messages, and checking the news. Time slips away as he gets engrossed in various posts and articles. Eventually, he tosses the phone aside and contemplates drifting back to sleep. Just a bit longer, he concludes.</p><p>After some time, Juri jerks awake once more and checks the time on his phone. He realizes he has slept for almost another hour. A lengthy yawn escapes him, and he returns to his morning routine with his phone. However, he soon finds that nature's call has become too insistent to ignore.</p><p>Reluctantly, Juri climbs out of bed, his only attire being a pair of boxers. He shuffles his way to the bathroom, still feeling the remnants of sleep clouding his mind.</p><p>In his sleepy stupor, Juri makes his way to the kitchen, where he finds Hokuto still dressed in his bedtime attire, his tousled hair and casual demeanor making him look even more endearing.</p><p>"Morning," Juri mumbles, his voice still thick with drowsiness, as he walks next to the kitchen counter.</p><p>Hokuto greets him with a warm smile, handing out a steaming mug of coffee. "Good morning, sleepyhead. Coffee should help you wake up."</p><p>As Juri takes his first sip of the hot brew, he casts a grateful look at Hokuto. "Thanks," he murmurs, really meaning that. Hokuto is one of the rare few who truly understand Juri's morning challenges. They exchange affectionate glances, and Hokuto gently caresses Juri's cheek. In that moment, such simple gestures of care and love feel incredibly heartwarming.</p><p>Their lips meet in a soft morning kiss, the lingering taste of coffee still on their tongues. But soon, the kiss deepens, and each one becomes longer and longer. Juri can't help himself as his other hand starts to explore Hokuto's body, fingers tracing along the contours of his chest and the curve of his waist.</p><p>As the kiss grows more intense, they find themselves unable to hold their mugs any longer, placing them carefully on the kitchen counter. With a subtle yet deliberate motion, Juri half-lifts Hokuto, who eagerly takes hold of his arms to sit on the counter's edge.</p><p>Hokuto's legs part invitingly, and Juri adjusts his position between them, their bodies pressing together intimately. Juri can feel the undeniable hardness of Hokuto, and he, too, grows increasingly aroused. Juri's hand ventures between them, slowly caressing Hokuto's bulge through his pants, and Hokuto's breath catches in response. He tightens his grip on Juri's arms, his fingers digging into the flesh of Juri's forearms. Juri's own arousal intensifies, his hardness becoming unmistakable through his boxers.</p><p>"I...," Juri mumbles between the soft kisses.</p><p>"Yes?" Hokuto mutters back.</p><p>"Come here."</p><p>As their lips part, Juri doesn't release Hokuto's hand, instead guiding him gently down from the counter. They move together, fingers entwined, towards the kitchen table.</p><p>Once there, Juri takes the lead, his movements both eager and purposeful. He clears the table of magazines, papers, and other miscellaneous items with a deft sweep. Then, he turns around and kisses Hokuto again, his hands gripping Hokuto's head firmly yet gently, deepening the kiss.</p><p>Hokuto skillfully maneuvers their bodies, shifting them to the edge of the table. With a hint of anticipation, he gradually eases Juri's boxers down. He guides Juri to lie on his back on the tabletop. Then, he lowers his head between Juri's legs, using his flat tongue to sensually lick from the base to the tip. Hokuto repeats this action several times before fully taking Juri's cock into his mouth, starting to suck him.</p><p>Hokuto continues to pleasure Juri, his actions are somewhat clumsy because he's not usually in this role. Yet it's still making Juri shudder, and he's feeling himself on the brink of climax, but he's not quite ready for that yet. He voices his thoughts aloud.</p><p>Hokuto stops, raising his head to meet Juri's eyes, a droplet of saliva hanging from his chin. "Perhaps we should move this to the bedroom," he suggests, his voice husky.</p><p>They stand up, and Juri moves directly to the bedroom while Hokuto retreats to the bathroom. Upon entering the bedroom, Juri gracefully eases himself onto the unmade bed. He stretches out, his body sinking into the soft sheets, and closes his eyes for a moment.</p><p>Juri touches his forehead, panting heavily as he waits in anticipation. Hokuto returns, fully naked and carrying condoms and lube. He yanks Juri by his ankles, opens his legs, and pours some lube into his fingers. As he starts slowly fingering Juri, Hokuto can't help but let out moans of his own, the sight and sensation of his boyfriends on the edge of pleasure quickly turning him on.</p><p>When they're both ready enough, they shift to lie on their sides. Hokuto puts on a condom, and then, with one arm hooked under Juri's knee, he pushes inside. He fucks him slowly, each thrust accompanied by a low groan. Juri responds with a contented sigh, softly murmuring Hokuto's name and enjoying every second.</p><p>Hokuto maintains a slow and gentle pace as he continues thrusting into Juri. Their bodies move in a soothing rhythm. Juri's breaths come in soft, shallow gasps, and he arches his back, pressing closer to Hokuto. He tilts his head slightly so Hokuto reaches to kiss him.</p><p>Juri's climax approaches, tension building slowly at the bottom of his stomach and warmly spreading to every inch of his body. But as his release finally arrives, it's a lazy and unhurried ecstasy that envelops him. He lets out a soft, contented moan, his body only slightly trembling with pleasure as he spills against the sheets.</p><p>For a moment, Juri wonders if his orgasm could still get stronger, more intense. But as he catches his breath, he realizes it's already over. It was a perfectly good yet typical morning orgasm, leaving him with a warm, satisfied feeling that he wouldn't trade for anything else at that moment.</p><p>Hokuto isn't far behind from coming. His thrusts grow more frantic. With one final, powerful thrust, Hokuto lets out a loud, guttural grunt, his body shuddering as he reaches the peak of his pleasure. Juri feels him spilling into the condom as Hokuto hugs him tight at the same time. It's as if his whole body relaxes in that moment as he lets out a long sigh.</p><p>For a while, they simply bask in the warmth of their post-sex cuddle, Hokuto's arms wrapped securely around Juri as they lie together in comfortable silence.</p><p>Eventually, Juri breaks the stillness. "You know, it would be nice if we could see each other more often, do more things together."</p><p>Hokuto nods in agreement, his chin resting on Juri's shoulder. "I think so too," he replies, his voice equally thoughtful. "Maybe we could plan a weekend trip or something, get away from the city for a while."</p><p>Juri smiles at the idea, the thought of spending more time with Hokuto filling him with warmth. "That sounds great," he concludes.</p><p>Hokuto tightens his embrace, reassuring Juri with a soft kiss on his temple. "We'll come up with something fun together," he promises.</p><p>Eventually, Hokuto eases himself out of the hug and slips away from the bed. Juri's ears pick up the subtle sound of a wrapper being disposed of in the trashcan. Moments later, the bathroom door clicks softly shut, and Juri can hear the distant sound of running water.</p><p>Hokuto returns with two small damp towels, tossing one to Juri, who uses it to clean himself up. As he wipes away the streaks on the sheet, Hokuto scrunches his nose in mild distaste.</p><p>"I think I should just change the sheets," Hokuto thinks aloud.</p><p>"Do other people really change their sheets after every time they have sex?" Juri asks.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, shaking his head. "Not everyone is like you and Shintaro," he replies. "You guys probably use the same sheets for two months, and that's pretty disgusting."</p><p>"Well, we like to think we're helping the environment by conserving water and detergent. And we're super tidy otherwise, I swear. You've seen pictures of our place, so you should know!"</p><p>Hokuto rolls his eyes playfully, teasing Juri with a smirk as he beckons him to step aside, taking charge of the soiled sheets. Juri, with a dramatic sigh, stands up to join in and assists with the sheet-changing operation. Together, they efficiently tackle the task, tossing the dirty linens into the laundry basket and replacing them with clean ones.</p><p>With the job done, they opt for putting clothes on, for fresh daytime outfits. Juri, however, admits to being a bit less fresh since he more or less already wore the same clothes the day before. Fortunately, he's stashed a few essentials in Hokuto's wardrobe - extra pairs of socks and boxers - which come in handy on such occasions.</p><p>As Juri glances over at Hokuto, he can't help but appreciate his distinctive style. Hokuto may call it a 'home outfit,' but it looks like something one could confidently wear while going around Harajuku on their Sunday shopping spree.</p><p>Later, Juri sprawls out on Hokuto's comfy couch. At the same time, Hokuto, with a needle and thread in hand, skillfully sews a loose button back onto Juri's outdoor jacket. Hokuto already noticed earlier that the button was dangerously hanging by a thin thread and offered his help to sew it back.</p><p>As Hokuto works on the jacket, Juri suddenly realizes it's probably time for him to head back home soon. The journey to Chiba takes some time, and he has work waiting for him the next day, which makes him grimace at the thought. He tells his concern aloud, making Hokuto hum thoughtfully.</p><p>"Oh boy," Hokuto begins, his eyes still focused on his precise sewing, "sometimes, I wish I could trade my crazy schedules for your fixed hours, at least for a week."</p><p>In the end, when he starts packing, Juri realizes that he has somehow managed to scatter half of his essential belongings around Hokuto's place. It takes him what feels like forever to locate everything. That is somewhat of a record, considering he only arrived last night with a small overnight bag and had limited time to spend there.</p><p>Just as he's starting to worry that he can't find his earbuds and they might just stay behind until the next visit, Hokuto comes to the rescue by the doorway, holding out the small white case with Juri's earbuds. Both relieved and slightly embarrassed, Juri shoves the case into his back pocket with a sheepish grin.</p><p>"Thanks," he says, still half-distracted by his futile search.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. "I'll fax you the invoice later."</p><p>Juri waves Hokuto goodbye and calls out a wish for him to have fun during his upcoming weeks in Hiroshima. Hokuto tells him to say hi to Shintaro, blows a kiss to him, and closes the door behind him.</p><p>As Juri steps outside, he's greeted by a light drizzle. With no umbrella in hand, he improvises by yanking the hood of his jacket over his head to shield himself from the rain. He quickens his steps, eager to get to the train station and begin his journey back to Chiba.</p><p>Once on the train, Juri takes out his phone and begins texting with Shintaro. Shintaro informs him that he's already on his way back home, almost there, and inquires about Juri's preferences for a takeaway dinner that night. Juri ponders the options momentarily before texting back he wouldn't mind some Korean food. He knows Shintaro's unwavering love for it. Juri also knows that Shintaro has had a long weekend and another exhausting work week ahead on the next day, so maybe the Korean food would be a perfect comforting treat then.</p><p>As he hits send, Juri can't help but smile at the thought of a cozy evening ahead, filled with good food and the comfort of his own home.</p><p>Juri goes through the familiar route of transferring trains at Chiba Station, his steps are almost automated as he follows the path from one platform to another without glancing at the signs above him.</p><p>However, as he stands on the platform, waiting for the next train, Juri glances at the schedule and realizes he could catch a faster one if he waits just a bit longer. Getting home sooner appeals to him, so he decides to lounge on one of the station benches.</p><p>He takes out his phone and starts scrolling through his messages. There's a particular conversation that catches his attention – the <em>'Good Fuck'</em> chat with Taiga with no messages yet. A mischievous grin plays on his lips as Juri scrolls through old photos and lands on the dick picture he took last week for Shintaro. He puts the pic between the spoiler tags that blur it and adds the warning text <em>open if you're in need of seeing tanaka juri's fantastic dick</em>. Too bad the action makes him a bit horny, damn it. He's just about to send the message when--</p><p>"Excuse me, should I wait for a rapid service if I want to go to Mount Nokogiri?"</p><p>Juri nearly drops his phone in surprise as he's startled by the sudden presence of a stranger. He quickly closes his phone screen and straightens his posture, attempting to regain his composure and pretending to look like he wasn't doing anything suspicious. "Oh yeah, definitely take a rapid one! The local train will take forever to get there."</p><p>When he raises his gaze, Juri finds himself looking at a friendly-looking guy around his age, complete with a backpack and hiking gear. It's clear that he's all set for outdoors. Pretty impressive.</p><p>"So, the next one in 20 minutes?" the guy clarifies.</p><p>"Yup, and take this first car because it always has vacant seats."</p><p>"Thanks for the tip," the guy says. "Are you a hiker yourself or just an expert on Nokogiri trains?"</p><p>"Nah, not a hiker," Juri says, "I just live along this line. And I'm also waiting for a rapid service... on the train line, I mean." He cringes inwardly at his correction, realizing it didn't make the statement any less suggestive. But the guy doesn't seem taken aback and instead responds with a flirtatious smile.</p><p>"Oh, I see," the guy says. "Well, maybe we can make the waiting more enjoyable and wait for it together unless you're intimidated by a weird guy approaching you so casually like this."</p><p>Juri forgets all about the unexpected dick pic plans as the guy nonchalantly shoves his backpack off and sits beside Juri. He introduces himself as Kochi Yugo, and Juri can't help but be a bit taken aback by his confidence. <em>Wow, is this flirting?</em> Juri wonders, feeling a bit out of his element when it comes to spontaneous flirting without the help of some alcohol.</p><p>Juri and Kochi continue to chat, the atmosphere surprisingly light and easygoing. Juri can't deny he's enjoying the sudden company that doesn't spare sending meaningful glances his way. As the time for the next train approaches, Juri checks his watch and calculates the schedule in his head. Risky but enticing, he decides.</p><p>He stretches his arms, pretending to stifle a yawn, and then locks eyes with Kochi, mustering the flirtiest gaze he can manage. "You know," he says seductively, "I think I need to go to the toilet real quick... There's another rapid service train coming soon after this one. Not sure if you're in a hurry and need to go ahead... Or maybe you need a head." He punctuates his words with an intense, suggestive glance, followed by a wink.</p><p>With that, Juri stands up and heads toward the staircase, descending to the lower platform on his way to the restroom. Alone in the bathroom, he mentally curses himself, wondering if he's just made a fool of himself by hitting on a random hiker. His last sentence was probably too much. Juri contemplates the worst-case scenario: hiding in the restroom for the next 40 minutes to avoid an awkward encounter with Kochi again. Maybe the guy would know his best, take the next train, and forget everything about such a silly encounter.</p><p>However, his thoughts are abruptly interrupted by approaching footsteps, and to his surprise, it's Kochi appearing behind the corner.</p><p>The sudden absence of Kochi's backpack briefly crosses Juri's mind, but he swiftly dismisses it when Kochi opens his mouth. "I think I can make it if I'll just take the next train as well," he says.</p><p>Juri grins in agreement, appreciating Kochi's quick thinking. His heart racing with anticipation, Juri quickly scans the surroundings to ensure there are no prying eyes. Satisfied, he seizes the opportunity and ushers Kochi into one of the restroom cubicles.</p><p>With practiced urgency, Juri pushes Kochi inside and quickly closes and locks the door behind them. It's a small, confined space, but he doesn't care less at that moment. Without wasting a moment, Juri captures Kochi's lips with his own in a fervent, heated kiss. Kochi responds with equal fervor, their tongues meeting immediately.</p><p>The heat between them intensifies rapidly as Juri's nimble fingers reach for Kochi's belt, deftly undoing it and pulling the zipper down. Juri quickly discovers that Kochi is already achingly hard. His fingers deftly navigate the confines of Kochi's underwear, revealing the throbbing arousal beneath. Without hesitation, Juri gracefully drops to his knees and skillfully takes Kochi into his mouth, fully accommodating him without a hint of a gag reflex – a talent he takes pride in.</p><p>Kochi's restrained moans are music to Juri's ears, and the sight of the profound pleasure he's delivering only fuels Juri's own growing arousal. It spurs him to work his magic even more intensely because Juri finds it incredibly sexy the way he can elicit such intense reactions from the person he's giving a blowjob to.</p><p>Kochi's thighs begin to tremble, a clear sign of his mounting climax. The sensation of Kochi's quivering thighs only motivates Juri to intensify his efforts. He sucks Kochi's cock with an insatiable hunger, his lips and tongue working perfectly as he expertly stimulates every sensitive spot. Juri's skilled hand doesn't neglect Kochi's balls, gently fondling and teasing them in time with his rhythmic movements.</p><p>Kochi's self-control starts to wane as he places his hands on Juri's head, his fingers tangling in Juri's hair. He begins to thrust his hips, slowly at first, then with growing urgency, fucking Juri's mouth with abandon. The sensation of being taken like this only drives Juri wild. <em>Good boy</em>, he thinks.</p><p>As Kochi reaches his climax, he can hardly contain a cry of pleasure. Juri knows that if there are others in the restroom, well, he's not feeling too sorry for them, but maybe just a little bit.</p><p>As the first taste of salty semen meets Juri's tongue, he expertly continues to stimulate Kochi through his whole orgasm. With practiced finesse, Juri ensures no drop is wasted, swallowing it all. Afterward, as Kochi's now limp member slips out of his mouth, Juri delicately wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, a satisfied smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Juri rises to his feet, straightening his jacket with a suave confidence that seems undisturbed by the moment they just shared. He casts an appreciative gaze over Kochi, his eyes staying momentarily before he speaks.</p><p>"I'll give you some time to freshen up," Juri says. "I'll be waiting right outside the toilet area." With that, he steps out of the cramped cubicle, leaving Kochi to collect himself in private.</p><p>Juri can't resist sending a message to Akito as he waits for Kochi outside the restroom. He taps out the text with a smirk.</p><p>
<em>just gave a blowjob to a good-looking hiker on my way home<br/>
feeling jealous already, senpai??</em>
</p><p>He knows about Akito's peculiar attraction to hikers. Akito has frequently declared his kink with men in hiking outfits, even revealing a secret desire to have sex with one in a tent someday. A notion that Juri is less than enthusiastic about due to his preference for comfort, thank you very much.</p><p>As Kochi returns, subtle shyness colors his demeanor, a noticeable difference from the confident guy Juri met on the platform earlier. Juri flashes a warm smile and pats Kochi's shoulder reassuringly. "Ready to get going?" he says.</p><p>Together, they return to the same platform where they were earlier, waiting for the train. And luckily, there's no awkward tension between them, but they continue with their casual chatting. Their conversation shifts to Chiba's attractions, and Juri is surprised to learn that Kochi seems more informed about important spots in Chiba than he is. It's Juri's hometown, after all, and yet here's this new acquaintance who appears to have a better grasp of it. Maybe Juri should consider going out more in the future. He could ask Shoki to accompany him.</p><p>Kochi tentatively mentions how much he enjoys solo camping but occasionally wouldn't mind some company for a change. Juri picks up on this.</p><p>"You know what, I actually have a couple of friends who are really into camping, as well," he says. "I could introduce you to them when I meet them the next time. It might be fun to meet up again, regardless. And who knows, maybe we could have a rematch of today's little session," he adds, flashing a playful wink.</p><p>"Let's see," Kochi muses mysteriously as the train approaches, and they step inside finally.</p><p>Kochi fishes his phone out of his pocket as they sit beside each other and hands it to Juri. "Here's my LINE," he says. Juri gladly accepts the phone, snatches a picture of the QR code from the screen, and adds Kochi as his friend.</p><p>As Juri's station approaches, he bids farewell to Kochi, wishing him good luck for a great hike. He can't help adding that Kochi should be cautious of encountering bears or potential hiker hunters. Kochi grimaces at that. "I was about to laugh out of politeness, but sorry... that was just too lame," he comments dryly. They laugh.</p><p>Finally, with a wave, Juri exits the train, leaving Kochi to continue his trip.</p><p>Back at home, Juri lets out a contented sigh as he kicks off his shoes, sending them tumbling haphazardly into the foyer and creating a shoe chaos. An undeniable sense of relief washes over him at the familiarity of his own space. He goes to the bedroom to throw his overnight bag on the bed but doesn't bother unpacking it yet.</p><p>It seems Shintaro, ever thoughtful, took care of all the remaining dirty dishes before his departure on Friday, and the kitchen now looks remarkably clean. Juri heads to the fridge, grabs a can of soda and takes a refreshing sip before opening the balcony door.</p><p>Outside, their collection of plants appears to be in dire need of a drink. Juri scans the floor space for a moment, searching for the spray bottle he remembers putting somewhere there earlier. After a brief hunt, he finally locates it under the small shelf and sets about the task of spraying some water on their green family members, both indoors and outdoors.</p><p>Juri can't help but roll his eyes amusingly at the memory of when Shintaro dragged him to a fortune-teller as a brilliant inside joke. The so-called psychic suggested that Juri should try gardening to relieve stress, which he promptly dismissed as nonsense.</p><p>Juri made his skepticism very known right there in the fortune-teller's little shop, much to Shintaro's amusement. They left, and both of them deduced that would be the end of the whole gardening topic.</p><p>But a week later, Juri had to endure the sight of Shintaro rolling on their apartment floor with laughter. Shintaro had spotted the first plant in their apartment, a secret purchase from Saitama's Ikea that Juri had made after his Tinder date. It seemed their little visit to the fortune-teller left an unexpected impact after all. Soon after, Juri started finding some stress relief in caring for his little plant and bought a new one. This prompted another fit of laughter from Shintaro. He laughed so much that Juri was certain the guy would soon keel over right there on the floor again.</p><p>Juri hears the door unlocking and the familiar creak of the front door swinging open. Thanks to the distinctive footsteps, he would know for sure it was Shintaro even if he wasn’t at their home waiting for him.</p><p>Turning from his plant-watering duties on the balcony and coming to the foyer, Juri follows Shintaro entering the apartment. He's carrying his suitcase, and a paper bag dangles from his arm. Shintaro's cap is pushed back on his head, and his skin looks slightly tanned like he's spent a lot of time outdoors.</p><p>"Welcome back, surfer boy," Juri greets him. "How was your trip?"</p><p>"Oh, it was amazing! Just wait until I tell you everything. I wanted to save the best bits, so I refrained from texting you because I wanted to see your face!"</p><p>Juri laughs, delighted by Shintaro's enthusiasm. But before he can say anything else, Shintaro's gaze shifts to the shoe chaos on the foyer floor. Shaking his head in disbelief, Shintaro steps out of his shoes, leaves his belongings on the floor with the already-created chaos, and walks over to Juri.</p><p>Without a word, he envelops Juri in a tight embrace, their bodies pressing close. Shintaro's lips find Juri's, and he kisses him with an intensity that leaves no doubt about how much he once again missed Juri during his trip.</p><p>When they break their kiss, their breaths stay slightly ragged, and Shintaro leans in to whisper against Juri's ear, "You taste like a dick, babe." He takes a quick nib of Juri's earring and tugs the earlobe a little bit with his teeth.</p><p>Juri smirks. "Well, I got a bit occupied on my way back."</p><p>Shintaro strokes Juri's cheek affectionately. "You're gross," he says with a mock disapproving tone. "You should consider brushing your teeth after such sessions. It's not good for your teeth, you know. My dentist warned me about that."</p><p>Juri fakes a dramatic gasp. "Wait, are you telling me you discuss blowjobs with your dentist? Maybe I should consider switching to that kind of dentist to help with my dentist phobia," he quips.</p><p>They share one more quick kiss. Then, Shintaro retrieves the paper bag from the foyer, eager to show Juri the souvenirs he's brought. He presents a variety of local snacks, each with its own unique flavor and packaging, describing where he found each one of them.</p><p>However, the real surprise comes when Shintaro pulls out a penguin plushie from the bag. He grins mischievously as he shoves it toward Juri, saying, "And this one's for you. It reminded me of your face."</p><p>Juri chuckles at the sight of the round, fluffy plushie and Shintaro's sweet gesture. "I suppose I can't claim I don't have a penguin pet at home anymore," he comments, playfully nudging Shintaro's arm. With a smile, he thanks for the gift, goes to the bedroom, and places the penguin on his side of the bed.</p><p>Not soon later, there's a knock on the door, announcing the arrival of their food delivery. Juri quickly rises from his seat and goes to the door to collect it, setting everything up on the table while Shintaro unpacks his luggage. When stepping into the kitchen, Shintaro looks at the table filled with food and smiles gratefully, his eyes reflecting his appreciation for Juri's thoughtfulness.</p><p>Once they're both seated, Shintaro starts narrating his weekend trip from the beginning, recounting the catastrophic start when the car door of his friend almost broke down at a service area, nearly causing them to miss the boat.</p><p>As Juri savors his meal with remarkable enthusiasm, Shintaro can't help but find it a bit amusing. "Seems like someone missed his meals again," he remarks.</p><p>Juri wears a sheepish expression and confesses, "Yeah, you know me and routines. I sort of lost track of time and ended up neglecting proper meals during the weekend."</p><p>"Sounds like you had quite the weekend anyway. I want to hear all about it. I mean, those balloon condoms again, seriously...?"</p><p>Juri's mind races through the package of events from the weekend: the lively karaoke session on Friday, the drunk sex at love hotel afterward, the visit to Akito's shop with a terrible hangover on Saturday, the lunch date with Jesse, the sleepover at Hokuto's place, and as a cherry on top, a new possible friend at the station. Yeah, quite the weekend, indeed.</p><p>"Well, where should I even begin?" he chortles and mimics Shintaro by just starting literally from the beginning. "So, I first want to blame fucking Daiki and his shots for the next day's headache, but okay, at karaoke, there was this super hot guy..."</p><p>As Juri recounts the events of his weekend, Shintaro listens with great enthusiasm, his reactions perfectly timed with laughter and nods of understanding. While explaining, Juri can't help but steal glances at Shintaro, a warm feeling of gratitude and affection swelling in his chest. He realizes how lucky he is to have such a perfect partner who wants the best for him, loves him unconditionally, and accepts him as he is. Suddenly, Juri doesn't feel a hangover-induced emotional surge; instead, he experiences a quiet, contented happiness. Maybe, he thinks, it's just love. And that's more than enough.</p><p>They sprawl on the couch after the meal, each occupying one end with their legs tangled together in the middle. Shintaro reaches for the Nintendo Switch and looks at Juri. "Mario Kart?" he suggests.</p><p>"Mario Kart," Juri answers simply.</p><p>They engage in their intense gaming session immediately when the game starts rolling. Their eyes are locked onto the screen, and the only sounds that break the concentration are occasional shouts of victory, bursts of laughter, and enthusiastic exclamations when a well-timed banana trap or skillful maneuver tilts the balance of the vehicle in one's favor.</p><p>After enduring three consecutive losses to Shintaro, Juri finally tosses his controller onto the carpet in frustration. He throws up his hands in mock surrender and declares, "I give up! You're just too good at this."</p><p>Shintaro smirks and leans in closer to Juri. "You know, I'm good at other things too," he purrs with a low voice. With a sly grin, he climbs over Juri, their faces drawing nearer until he kisses Juri.</p><p>"Oh, could you show me more," Juri answers as their kiss breaks.</p><p>"The winner can choose," Shintaro says, leaning down to kiss Juri again.</p><p>Their kiss deepens, a languid exploration of each other's lips and tongues. Shintaro's hand cups Juri's face, his thumb gently caressing his cheek. Juri reciprocates, his fingers curling around the hem of Shintaro's shirt, inching it upward in a silent invitation.</p><p>Shintaro's hand ventures beneath Juri's shirt, his fingers gently massaging Juri's abdomen before moving upward. He reaches Juri's nipples, rubbing them with a teasing touch. Juri's breath hitches at the sensation, and he arches into Shintaro's caress, a soft moan escaping his lips. The sensation feels incredibly good, so familiar, and Juri can't help but relax into it. In Shintaro's arms, he feels completely at ease, as if the world outside ceases to exist. It's a moment of pure enjoyment where he can only concentrate on himself and Shintaro's pleasure, just making both of them feel good.</p><p>Juri grabs the back of Shintaro's head, tilting it slightly to gain better access to Shintaro's neck. With a fervor that leaves no doubt about his intentions, Juri places a wet trail of heated kisses on the sensitive skin. He licks and sucks on the area, savoring the familiar taste of Shintaro's skin before he playfully scrapes his teeth on the spot just below Shintaro's earlobe. He knows the gesture is arousing, and Shintaro groans quietly.</p><p>Shintaro decides to shift their position and raises himself up to sit on his knees, still straddling Juri. Knowing they are eager to shed their clothes, Juri raises his arms, inviting Shintaro to help him remove his shirt. Shintaro complies, deftly pulling Juri's shirt off and tossing it aside.</p><p>Shintaro then peels his shirt over his head, exposing his tanned torso. Leaning back down, he captures Juri's lips in another searing kiss. Their mouths meld together, tongues dancing. Shintaro's hand ventures lower between their bodies, finding its way to Juri's crotch. With a knowing touch, he begins to rub the growing bulge, intensifying the senses coursing through Juri's body.</p><p>Soon, Shintaro breaks the kiss and stands up, giving them both the space they need to shed their pants. They remove the rest of their clothes, leaving them both completely naked.</p><p>Shintaro realizes that they'll need something more for what they have in mind. "Oops, yeah, wait a second," he quickly excuses himself, promising to be back in a moment, and heads off to retrieve some lube.</p><p>When Shintaro returns, Juri gestures gently for him to get on the couch first, indicating that he has something special in mind. Shintaro grins knowingly, understanding Juri's intentions as he positions himself on his knees on the sofa. Juri then moves behind him, spreading Shintaro's buttocks and bringing his mouth closer. He starts by sensually licking the skin around the entrance before pushing his tongue inside. The sultry moans that escape Shintaro's lips drive Juri wild. Shintaro's sounds of pleasure only fuel Juri's own arousal. Juri yearns to touch himself, but he fears he might come too soon. Not that it would necessarily be a bad thing, but he's determined to fuck Shintaro first.</p><p>Eventually, Shintaro passes him a stick of lube, and Juri carefully spreads it over his fingers. He then pushes his fingers inside, all the while lavishing attention on the surrounding sensitive skin with his tongue.</p><p>After a while, Shintaro grasps Juri's hand, signaling him to withdraw his fingers and that way telling him it's fine, they can go on. Juri complies, and Shintaro repositions himself on his back. Juri raises Shintaro's legs over his shoulders, hovering tantalizingly at the entrance before gradually pushing his cock inside.</p><p>It's so slow and it's so fucking good. As they unfold at a gentle rhythm, they subtly shift their positions. Juri now has better access to Shintaro's face and leans down to capture his lips in a slow kiss, sucking his plum lower lip and tasting him in all senses he can imagine.</p><p>Juri intentionally prolongs the buildup of his orgasm, savoring the sensations, but soon, he decides he's had enough and quickens his pace. It takes only a few seconds of fervent thrusts and Shintaro's hot tightening clench around him before Juri reaches his climax. He spills inside Shintaro, relishing the sensation of being bare, with nothing between them but skin, and it feels amazing.</p><p>Juri remains inside Shintaro, but his hand moves lower to jerk him. It doesn't take long before Shintaro cums as welll, his sperm dripping down his shaft onto Juri's hands. Absentmindedly, Juri brings his hand to his mouth and licks it clean.</p><p>"You always taste delicious," Juri murmurs before leaning down to kiss Shintaro once more, their lips lingering in a simple gentle press against each other.</p><p>They remain in their tight hug for a while, still basking in the orgasm afterglow, with Juri lying atop Shintaro and his fingers gently tracing circles on Shintaro's chest. Until Shintaro announces, they should better prepare soon if they still want to do the grocery shopping that day.</p><p>Once finally settled in the car, Juri takes the wheel, and Shintaro, in charge of the music, selects one episode from the podcast they often enjoy listening to during their long car drives together. Sundays like this, a chill drive and a good podcast, have become their thing. Throughout their years together, Shintaro has taught Juri to live each day to the fullest, making the most of their downtime because, <em>well, Monday will show up no matter what, right?</em> Along with that, Juri has also learned to savor Sundays, kick back, recharge, and enjoy the simple stuff. He doesn't need to worry about the next day because it'd come anyway and show what it has in store for him.</p><p>Their first stop is at Nitori furniture department, where they had the straightforward task of simply buying a new bed for Shelly. But, as often happens during their shopping trips, they get carried away. Alongside the dog bed, they pile up their cart with an array of items: decorative cushions to freshen up their living space, a shoehorn, a shiny new frying pan, new pairs of slippers for both of them and - thanks to Juri's insistence - a couple of new diffusers to infuse their home with the new scents of the season.</p><p>Their grocery shopping luckily goes smoother, and once they've checked everything off their to-do list, they decide to cap off the day with a stop at a conveyor belt sushi place for a quick dinner.</p><p>As they sit at the table, plates of sushi in front of them, Juri raises a piece of scallop sushi with his chopsticks. "Scallop always reminds me of how I first time really realized I'm gay," he muses aloud.</p><p>Shintaro can't help but chuckle at the unexpected topic. "Ahahaha, what the fuck, do tell?" Curious, he leans in to listen to Juri's explanation.</p><p>Juri shares how he had experiences with girls in the past, genuinely trying to like them, but found their physical interactions to be like dealing with oysters – slimy and utterly confusing. Then, he recounts the moment he kissed a guy for the first time, comparing it to eating a perfectly prepared scallop. It had the perfect texture and taste, just like scallops have.</p><p>"After that, I realized I no longer wanted to deal with oysters. I'm sticking with scallops," Juri then concludes his story. Shintaro bursts into laughter at his partner's analogy and raises another scallop sushi piece with his chopsticks.</p><p>"To the scallop life then, I guess," Shintaro proclaims.</p><p>After the dinner, Shintaro drives them back home, and they unwind by watching an episode of a reality series on Netflix. Later, they occupy themselves with their phones, comfortably sharing the silence.</p><p>Juri receives a couple of pictures from Jesse's camping trip and engages in a short conversation with his boyfriend about how the trip went. He also tells Jesse about his meeting with Kochi and suggests the three of them go out sometime soon once he's briefly explained the whole situation to Kochi. Then Juri sends a message to Kochi, asking about his trip and suggesting the meeting. The messages remain unread, though - Kochi is probably somewhere deep in the woods without the coverage for the next few days.</p><p>Hokuto sends Juri a voice message. Considering the background noises, he's apparently still on the filming set. Juri listens to the message with his earphones on, a smile forming as he hears his boyfriend's soothing voice. Hokuto would make a great ASMR host, and Juri makes a mental note to suggest that in case Hokuto's acting career blows up for one reason or another.</p><p>Then, Juri opens his conversation with Taiga, finding a draft of the message with his dick pic that he never sent. Without hesitation, he sends it, immediately receiving a drooling emoji as a reaction. Then Taiga responds promptly with an image attached that widens Juri's eyes in surprise.</p><p>Shintaro, curious about Juri's reaction, asks what happened. Juri stutters for a moment, then laughs at his own speechlessness. "I'm just texting with my Friday hookup, and I just received a very interesting photo from him."</p><p>Shintaro smiles briefly, his attention returning to his own phone.</p><p>As they settle into their bed, Juri sighs contentedly. His own bed is the best place in the whole world.</p><p>"Good night, Juri," Shintaro wishes, kissing Juri's cheek before pulling the duvet over himself and turning off the bedside light.</p><p>"Good night, Shintaro," Juri replies. "I'll see you in the morning."</p>
