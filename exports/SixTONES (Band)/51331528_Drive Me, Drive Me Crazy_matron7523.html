<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Hokuto enters the meeting room, his entrance more or less goes unnoticed. The rest of the group is completely fixated on Jesse, who's in full storytelling mode and waving his arms funnily along the explanation. After listening intently for a while, Hokuto understands that, apparently, Jesse has recently immersed himself into a new rabbit hole, also known as a new Korean drama series. And now he is generously explaining its plot to the entire group.</p><p>"And in the grand finale," Jesse continues, building up the suspense, "they miraculously reunite exactly one year after his presumed death date. They swear never to part ways again, and the episode climaxes with an epic sunset kiss!"</p><p>His words generate wild reactions from the members.</p><p>"That's so nice!" says Shintaro, while Taiga, seated beside him, lets out a brief yet impressed "oooh" sound.</p><p>Hokuto can't help but stifle a soft snort as he watches his members. He's secretly amused by how an explanation about a simple romance show has turned them into an enthralled audience. Well, it's all in good fun.</p><p>"That's heartwarming, isn't it?" Juri comments, his hand on his cheek, eyes gleaming with sentiment as if the previous story has just deeply touched something in his soul. "I'd love to have that kind of romance in my life, too."</p><p>Juri's comment immediately catches Hokuto's attention. Such sentiments aren't often heard coming from Tanaka Juri, and it doesn't escape the notice of the others in the room either.</p><p>"You? Romance?" Shintaro asks with slight disbelief in his voice. Juri responds with a nonchalant shrug.</p><p>"I mean, yeah," Juri responds, his expression turning a touch more serious. "I'd really be open to romance, but you guys know how challenging dating has become for us. We can't even go out for a simple dinner without someone recognizing us. Love hotels? Out of the question. And doing anything nice without someone taking photos and spreading rumors online? It's nearly impossible." He shakes his head in frustration.</p><p>"But then again," Kochi muses thoughtfully, "haven't you consistently stated, practically everywhere, that committing to only one woman and marriage aren't exactly your thing? So, what's with this sudden change of course?"</p><p>"Hey, did I explicitly mention I'd want those romantic things with any <em>woman</em>?" Juri rolls his eyes. He emphasizes the word 'woman' with a pointed inflection before indulging in a dramatic bout of groaning.</p><p>"All I'm asking for," he adds with a defeated sigh, "is the simple joy of holding hands or, I don't know, taking cute selfies together and after that kissing senseless behind the corner, doing all that disgustingly romantic stuff. You know, all those little things!"</p><p>Shintaro, appearing greatly amused by Juri's dramatic lament, pretends to hold a megaphone by cupping his hand around his mouth. He faces the others. "Ah, it seems Tanaka Juri has activated his dramatic mode once more," Shintaro dryly announces to them. "I propose we disregard his theatrics and just let it pass."</p><p>Even with Shintaro's attempts of teasing, Juri's complaints persist, the whiny tone in his voice becoming more pronounced. "It's just not fair," he continues, emphasizing his predicament. "Our lives, guys, our lives..."</p><p>"I'm content with my life as it is!" Jesse interjects, attempting to bring some positivity into the conversation, but Juri brushes off his comment.</p><p>"Consider Hokuto, for instance," Juri says, pointing at Hokuto with his thumb over his shoulder. "He's quite the catch, a real hot piece, and yet that workaholic wouldn't even have the <em>time</em> to go on dates! How unfair is that?"</p><p>Juri's comment catches Hokuto's attention more than he would expect.</p><p>As other people trickle into the room and the meeting begins, Juri's earlier words linger in Hokuto's mind, even as the conversation shifts and the room fills with discussions. They gather around the table, focusing on the papers their managers hand out.</p><p>During the meeting, Hokuto occasionally steals glances at Juri, noticing his animated expressions and the sparkle in his eyes when the discussion topic goes in the direction that interests him. Juri presents his comments in a professional yet considerate manner, showing his understanding of others' opinions and offering suggestions instead of commands. Observing Juri's considerate nature triggers a thought in Hokuto: when was the last time someone showed a similar level of consideration for Juri? Not in a while, judging from Juri's earlier comments.</p><p>An idea begins to form in Hokuto's mind.</p><p>As the meeting winds down, Hokuto's vague notion has solidified into a proper plan. For once, he wants to be the one to propose something for Juri, something that he has longed for and truly deserves.</p><p>Hokuto walks up to Juri, feeling a slight dampness in his palms. It's amusing, his hands <em>shouldn't</em> be sweaty. After all, it's just Juri.</p><p>"Hey, I'd like to take you out for a date," Hokuto says.</p><p>"Wait, what?" Juri responds, blinking in surprise.</p><p>"I'd like to take you out for a date," Hokuto repeats.</p><p>Realizing that he indeed might have taken Juri by surprise as he doesn't seem to get anything back but a questioning look, Hokuto immediately launches into a lengthy, rambling explanation.</p><p>"Well, you see," he starts, "I couldn't help but think about what you said earlier about not having time for romantic stuff, and it got me thinking. I mean, we've been so busy with work and all, and maybe it's time we took a break and did something just for us, you know? And I've been thinking that maybe it's worth a shot, trying something different, even if it's just one date. It doesn't have to be a big deal, and I don't want you to feel any pressure, but if you're up for it, I'd like to take you out and spend some quality time together, and we can pretend like it would be a real date. And, if it's not your thing or you'd rather not, that's completely fine, too. I just thought, why not try it? If you want, I'll make sure to set something disgustingly romantic for you, as you earlier put it. Besides, we don't have to care about someone snapping those pictures and spreading rumors online because, come on, what would be the worst that could happen? Someone seeing us out together and then spreading rumors that Juri and Hokuto might have a duo song coming up soon?"</p><p>Hokuto quickly realizes that he might have caught Juri off guard with his lengthy and somewhat convoluted explanation. It indeed wasn't the most straightforward invitation, to say the least.</p><p>Finally, after a moment of slight perplexity, Juri bursts into a smile.</p><p>"Did you just ask me out in the most nonsensical way possible?" he asks, visibly amused.</p><p>"Errr, maybe?"</p><p>Hokuto feels a bit dumb for bringing his suggestion out like that. He's not smooth at this kind of stuff, and he's very aware of that. Maybe he should just stick to the script in real life. That's what he masters at work.</p><p>"But, as I mentioned, saying 'no' is completely okay, and it won't offend me," Hokuto assures hastily.</p><p>"No, it's not about that. I'm just surprised by how... unexpected it all is. Did my comment about you being a workaholic really trigger this much of a reaction?" Juri maintains eye contact, a hint of amusement lingering on his face.</p><p>Hokuto takes a moment to consider that. Frankly, his suggestion was partly prompted by Juri's earlier desire for a romantic date. Then he realized how much Juri would deserve one. However, if he's completely honest, it's also influenced by the captivating smiles Juri offered during their meeting, and after imagining how those smiles might appear in a romantic setting. Of course, he wouldn't confess that to Juriâ€”it might come off as if he's head over heels for him or something.</p><p>"Ah yeah, well, something like that," Hokuto replies simply.</p><p>"So, what would be the plan, then?" Juri asks.</p><p>"You wouldn't have to do anything. Just show up at the designated time and place, and I'll take care of the rest."</p><p>"And then I'd just expect you to sweep me off my feet?"</p><p>"Absolutely. I've got plenty of surprises that will leave you completely enamored with me," Hokuto teases.</p><p>Juri laughs. "Alright, let's go on a date then!"</p><p>They start to go through their schedules - with Hokuto pointing out that he's not <em>as</em> busy as Juri liked to tease him. To their amazement, they quickly discover that they both miraculously have an evening off next Thursday, eliminating the need to wait for weeks.</p><p>"Ahhh, luckily, it's not a morning date," Hokuto says, "I wouldn't put too high bets on you waking up early enough, even if I were serving something nice on a tray. There's never a guarantee that you'd be awake."</p><p>"I've been known to be an early riser when needed. But evening dates are definitely a safer bet," Juri defends himself. It's a tacit acknowledgment that his definition of 'rising early' often translates to 'staying up all night and not sleeping at all'.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles and shakes his head. "I'll come to your place to pick you up around five," he then says.</p><p>Juri's face lights up with a smile.</p><p>That smile affects Hokuto in an odd way. It stirs a slight unease within him, though he can't exactly put his finger on why. Then again, Hokuto often throws himself wholeheartedly into his acting roles, so perhaps it's just a similar experienceâ€”fully immersing himself into a character, but this time, it's in real life.</p><p>He reminds himself to curb that habit.</p><p>He really should stop overdoing that.</p><p>****</p><p>Thursday finally arrives, and as Hokuto stands behind Juri's apartment door, a sudden realization hits him: he never discussed the plan to use Juri's car for the day. He mentally scolds himself, wondering why he assumed he could use Juri's car without asking. It seems he's grown too accustomed to being driven around by others.</p><p>Hokuto ponders suggesting he could drive Juri's car, but then he considers whether Juri would be comfortable letting someone else handle his prized vehicle. Plus, it's been months since Hokuto last drove, making it both an unattractive and potentially unsafe choice.</p><p>He grapples with the absurdity of his mistakeâ€”suggesting a date and expecting the other person to drive. The thought of himself as the passenger while poor Juri navigating through heavy traffic, feels uncomfortable, particularly since this day was meant to center around Juri.</p><p>Thankfully, Juri takes the situation in stride.</p><p>"Not a problem," Juri responds casually. "I've been wanting to take my car out on my days off more often. I enjoy driving â€“ unlike you. So, as I said, no worries."</p><p>Despite Juri's easygoing attitude, Hokuto can't shake the lingering feeling of slight embarrassment as he settles into the front passenger seat, feeling as though he's now the one being taken out on a date.</p><p>After they both buckle their seatbelts, Juri glances at Hokuto. "So, where to, navigator?" he asks.</p><p>Hokuto scratches his head. "I was thinking we could, you know, just go for a random drive without a specific destination in mind," he says. "We could find a nice spot for a break, maybe grab a coffee, or just chill at some random parking lot. Isn't that what people do on dates? I mean, everyone in this industry talks about driving dates and stopping somewhere, right? It could be fun."</p><p>Despite his attempt to take the lead in planning the date, Hokuto feels self-conscious, realizing he might have once again rambled about irrelevant things. Despite his efforts, he struggles to control himself in such moments. Will he ever become skilled at handling these situations?</p><p>Juri bursts into gentle laughter at Hokuto's explanation.</p><p>"Chill out," he reassures, casually resting a comforting hand on Hokuto's shoulder in his usual laid-back style, giving it a gentle squeeze with his fingertips. "A spontaneous drive sounds great. Let's roll with it."</p><p>As Juri is about to start the car, Hokuto sees an opportunity to reveal the first surprise of the day. He raises a finger, signaling Juri to wait for a second, and digs into his bag before proudly displaying a CD case.</p><p>"And here's a surprise for you," Hokuto announces, presenting the case. "We won't have to rely on the radio. I've brought some music." He emphasizes, "Romantic music, to set the right atmosphere for our drive." After all, that's what Juri wished for, right?</p><p>Juri's eyes light up. "Ooh, nice!" he says. "What a thoughtful idea."</p><p>However, as Hokuto opens the case, a sinking feeling washes over him. Instead of a stack of romantic CDs, he's staring at a collection of DVDs. It's his DVD case, not the CD case. He wants to facepalm. For a moment, he considers whether he should proceed with it and play it off as if this was the original plan from the beginning.</p><p>Juri must notice Hokuto's baffled expression. "What's wrong?"</p><p>Hokuto sighs, feeling a flush of embarrassment warming his face. It's definitely not the expected start to the date Juri had been hoping for. It looks like there won't be any music for them after all.</p><p>"Well," he begins sheepishly. "I don't even know how this happened, but it must be because my morning routine was a bit rushed. I didn't grab the bag that I usually use at work, and I was taken a bit off guard in all possible ways. But it looks like I've brought my DVD case instead of the CDs, and I didn't even notice until this very moment. My bad."</p><p>Juri's expression shifts to something slightly comical, and a chuckle escapes him. "Oh well, stuff happens," he then says lightly. "Why not roll with the DVDs, then? You've brought them all the way here. It would be a shame to let them go to waste."</p><p>Hokuto hesitates for a moment, pondering the practicality of the situation. "Wouldn't watching movies while driving be a bit dangerous?" he questions, voicing his concerns.</p><p>Juri grins in response. "We won't watch them," he clarifies, "but we can listen to the movie. There's no need for a moving screen, and the audio system in this car can easily play DVD audio. Plus, aren't audio-only podcasts quite the trend these days? It's like having a movie podcast on the road â€“ a drive-in experience without the screen!"</p><p>Still feeling slightly embarrassed because of his silly mistake, Hokuto starts flipping through the case's pages and listing the various movie titles, hoping that concentrating on that would make him forget his stupid mistake. There are some obscure foreign art films that would require subtitles, a few well-known Hollywood classics, and some of his personal favorites, including anime movies.</p><p>Hokuto notices that Juri's eyes light up when he mentions Princess Mononoke.</p><p>"Ah, Princess Mononoke," Juri says, "I love that movie and haven't watched it for ages. Let's watch it now!"</p><p>Hokuto shoots him a quizzical look.</p><p>"Let's listen to it now," Juri quickly corrects himself.</p><p>Hokuto shrugs, perfectly okay with any movie, and carefully inserts the disc into the car's player. The familiar clunk of the disc being loaded resonates until the movie's intro song starts playing.</p><p>Juri lets out an excited sigh, a wide grin forming as he turns to Hokuto.</p><p>"This is awesome," he exclaims.</p><p>Hokuto can't help but chuckle, his earlier embarrassment turning into amusement as he watches Juri's excitement. This might be one of the weirdest starts to a date he's ever experienced, but there's something oddly charming about its lameness. Maybe it's because Juri has a knack for making even strange situations enjoyable; the same situation might have been a disaster with someone else.</p><p>Juri starts the engine, and the car purrs to life.</p><p>"How about we drive all the way to Narita?" Hokuto suggests.</p><p>"Sure, let's do it," Juri agrees with a smile. "A spontaneous road trip date to Narita it is."</p><p>*****</p><p>They continue to chat as they drive, and finally, when Juri merges onto the highway, the road stretches ahead with fewer cars and traffic lights in sight, making the drive even more relaxing. The audio of the Princess Mononoke movie plays in the background, and they know some lines by heart. Occasionally, they can't resist reciting those lines in unison.</p><p>Hokuto finds himself appreciating the changing scenery as daylight fades into dusk. The conversation between him and Juri flows smoothly, almost like a genuine date rather than a planned pretend one. Juri's easygoing nature keeps things relaxed, and even the moments of silence between their talks feel completely natural and comfortable.</p><p>Despite the DVD-CD confusion and the unplanned driving situation, Juri seems to be enjoying himself. Hokuto must admit he's also enjoying himself. Maybe he isn't such a terrible date planner after all.</p><p>When they finally reach the Narita area, Hokuto's eyes catch the intersection sign for the airport, and an idea pops into his mind.</p><p>"Hey, what about a quick stop at the airport? Could be cool."</p><p>"Oh sure, why not," Juri readily agrees and switches lanes. From there, it's only a couple of toll gates before they're basically at the airport already.</p><p>Upon securing a suitable parking spot, they leave the car behind and venture into the bustling terminal building.</p><p>The airport is abuzz with travelers, mainly comprising foreign groups handling their oversized luggage. Hokuto finds it nice that they blend into the background, scarcely drawing any attention. It's unlikely that their fans would expect to encounter them at the airport on an ordinary Thursday evening.</p><p>Ascending to the terminal's second floor, they discover several small cafÃ© chains. Randomly choosing one, Hokuto takes the lead and heads directly to the counter to order for both of them. He requests two cups of Americanos and a chocolate Ã©clair to share. Despite Juri's objections, Hokuto insists on paying for everything.</p><p>"I was the one asking you out, so I'll handle this," Hokuto insists, presenting his credit card.</p><p>As they sit at the table, Juri enjoys a sip of coffee and a bite of the Ã©clair before letting out a contented sigh. "This is a great breakfast," he remarks.</p><p>Hokuto playfully scoffs as he puts his mask away. "Sure, it's clearly breakfast for you at seven o'clock in the evening," he jokes.</p><p>Juri chuckles at Hokuto's teasing, and then Hokuto adds, "Maybe I should move in with you to ensure you're eating and sleeping properly. Or at least make sure we'll room together once we're on tour again."</p><p>Juri's eyes soften. "Aww, that's so cute that you pretend to care so much."</p><p>Hokuto would like to point out that he's not pretending. He truly cares about Juri's well-being and happiness, just like Juri cares for his. But he decides to keep this sentiment to himself because it sounds serious and kind of sappy even in his mind. And Hokuto is not willing to make things too serious or sappy in any way on this fun-filled day when the idea was just to make Juri have as much fun and relaxation as possible.</p><p>As they settle back in the car, the sounds of the Princess Mononoke movie resume. Juri starts the engine and glances at Hokuto. "So, what's the plan now?" he asks.</p><p>"Dinner, definitely dinner," Hokuto says.</p><p>He leans over to type the restaurant's address into the car's navigator. As he's typing, he can't help but start humming the melody of their song 'Navigator'.</p><p>Juri's eyes light up. "Oh, it's 'Navigator'! I recognized it!"</p><p>Then Juri begins humming a known melody in return, humorously modulating his voice to mimic a high-pitched tone.</p><p>Hokuto listens attentively for a moment. "That's 'Imitation Rain'!" he exclaims, and they share a happy laugh after that.</p><p>They keep playing the game as they drive back to the Tokyo area, changing the rhythm to slower or quicker to make it more challenging to guess the right song. At some point, they start mimicking Taiga's vibrato and some of their senpais' singing styles to make it even trickier.</p><p>No doubt, playing the <em>introdon</em> game with just the two of them isn't the most usual date activity. Typically, it's a game meant for the whole gang of six when they're all together. But as Hokuto steals a glance at Juri and sees the pure joy in his eyes, he quickly realizes that seeing Juri happy makes even the oddest activities totally worthwhile.</p><p>After an extra hour of driving, the movie audio having ended a while ago, they finally pull into the restaurant's parking lot. Juri's eyes light up a bit as he realizes they're going to a yakiniku place. Hokuto feels a small wave of relief; he figures this part of their date is sure to be a hit since he knows Juri loves quality meat.</p><p>While waiting for their turn near the entrance, Hokuto mentions that he was considering them opting for an all-you-can-eat deal.</p><p>"So that you won't have to struggle with anything you don't like, and this way, I'm ensuring you eat enough," he explains.</p><p>"It's seriously so cute that you're taking this pretend of care to the next level." Juri gently nudges Hokuto's arm with his.</p><p>"You think I'm pretending?" Hokuto asks, a bit confused.</p><p>In response, Juri simply shrugs, and Hokuto can't help but wonder a little bit about the meaning behind that reaction.</p><p>*****</p><p>Unfortunately, the yakiniku experience doesn't end up meeting their expectations.</p><p>First, they're directed to a table that was clearly occupied just moments before and not properly cleaned. The way Juri shoots the table a skeptical look makes Hokuto mentally scold himself for not specifying the table requirements better for the restaurant. He knows that cleanliness is a top priority for Juri, and such hasty turnovers at the not-so-clean table don't sit well with him.</p><p>Second, the meat itself, while edible, isn't of the best quality, and Juri can't hide his slight look of disappointment even though he doesn't say anything.</p><p>The most frustrating part, though, is the grill on their table, which happens to be one of the weakest ones they've ever encountered. When they put the meat on it, it barely sizzles.</p><p>"This grill isn't really up to par, is it?" Juri comments, eyeing the feeble grill between them and the lackluster sizzle coming from it.</p><p>Hokuto senses a growing twinge of disappointment as he acknowledges that he might have made a poor choice with the restaurant. Attempting to align with Juri's observation, he remarks, "Yeah, it's quite awful."</p><p>Internally, he harshly criticizes himself further, feeling genuinely remorseful for Juri - and for himself. Why couldn't even this activity go as planned?</p><p>"I'm sorry, this place isn't what you expected for sure," Hokuto then admits aloud, sighing.</p><p>"What are you apologizing for?" Juri asks with a sincere tone. He uses his chopsticks to pick up a piece of meat, studying it thoughtfully before locking eyes with Hokuto. "It's not like it'd be your fault."</p><p>"Well, it kind of is, but thank you for taking it so easy," Hokuto says. He offers a small, appreciative smile.</p><p>After all, it was Hokuto who had meticulously planned this date, and so far, none of the things have been precisely going according to his ideal scenario. He wishes he had come up with something more engaging, more fun, and less dull. These minor setbacks wouldn't have cast a shadow on the plans if they had been more exciting to begin with.</p><p>At that very moment, Hokuto can't help but think about the contrast between himself and Juri.</p><p>While Juri might downplay his own personality as "dull" and keeps saying that in public all the time, still he effortlessly captivates other people with his charisma, lovely laughter, and an unspoken kindness that emanates from him, even when he's not uttering a word. Juri, in his way, possesses a knack for making other people feel special. Hokuto believes that with a personality like Juri's, it'd be inconceivable for Juri to come up with anything dull.</p><p>Hokuto knows that he himself can't emulate those qualities, no matter how hard he tries. After all, Hokuto is the quieter, more analytical one in all senses, the planner who's always thinking a few steps ahead. And even if he tries to get crazy with his ideas, the humor usually comes from his ideas being so dull and so little entertaining that everyone thinks he's just joking and being lame on purpose.</p><p>Hokuto could only wish to possess even a fraction of Juri's innate ability to make people feel special, the warmth and care that Juri effortlessly bestows upon Hokuto and others.</p><p>To put it simply, Juri makes him feel special, but Hokuto often feels he can't return the favor in even the most minor way.</p><p>As their dinner concludes, the experience with the less-than-impressive grilled meat now behind them, Hokuto once again takes charge of settling the bill.</p><p>Walking across the parking lot toward Juri's car, Juri asks, "What's your next plan for us?"</p><p>Hokuto hesitates. "Well, that was pretty much it. That's all I had in mind."</p><p>Juri's eyebrows rise a bit, but he quickly and politely composes himself. "Oh, I see. Thanks, Hokuto. It was fun."</p><p>Regret tugs at Hokuto as he notices a touch of disappointment in Juri's eyes again. Why hadn't he planned more for the evening? A perfect date, especially for Juri, would've included more than just driving, listening to a movie, stopping for coffee, and having an average barbecue for dinner. He mentally scolds himself for not thinking it through better.</p><p>Actually, Hokuto had a loose idea for the ending part of their date, but he had dismissed it, thinking it wouldn't work. But seeing Juri's disappointment makes him reconsider. After all, Juri can always decline, and that'd be perfectly okay.</p><p>Thinking it over, Hokuto decides to be upfront. "You know, I actually had one more thing in mind, but I wasn't sure if I should bring it up..."</p><p>"Oh, really? What is it?"</p><p>"Well, a friend of mine from Shizuoka is a manager of a hotel chain," Hokuto explains. "He said he could book us a room under a fake name without too many questions."</p><p>"A hotel room? What's the catch?" Juri's expression looks puzzled, and Hokuto realizes the idea might sound strange.</p><p>"No catch, I promise," Hokuto assures quickly. "I thought I could ask him to get a room for us. We could stay over and head home tomorrow. No stress about cleaning or anything; we can just chill and call it the perfect ending to our date."</p><p>"Just sleeping?"</p><p>"Just sleeping."</p><p>"Nothing more, or?"</p><p>"Nope," Hokuto confirms, shaking his head. The more Juri looks uncertain, the more awkward the situation feels to become.</p><p>"Okay, why not," Juri agrees, yet he still looks slightly weird.</p><p>Hokuto dials his friend, occasionally glancing at Juri, who still wears an expression that Hokuto can't read at all. Once the call ends and the room arrangements are settled, Hokuto feels the need to reassure Juri once more about the situation. "Hey, it'll be okay. Even if word gets out, people will probably think we're filming something for work."</p><p>"Oh, it's not about that," Juri says.</p><p>"What is it then?"</p><p>Juri shrugs.</p><p>"Well, anyway, don't worry," Hokuto says.</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>They arrive at the hotel. A bell captain promptly arrives at the parking lot, passing an envelope through the car window. Taking the envelope with the room key inside, they head to the elevator from the parking area, reaching the correct floor without encountering anyone else. Hokuto's friend has indeed done a great job, just as promised.</p><p>The hotel room is cozy with a semi-king-sized bed and soft lighting, offering a view of a wall of the neighboring house from the window.</p><p>Everything reminds Hokuto of their early days as juniors, sharing a hotel room together.</p><p>Hokuto had arranged for extra touches through his friend: a rose and a bottle of red wine on the table. It's a bit clichÃ©, but Juri seems genuinely impressed upon seeing the gifts.</p><p>"Wow, you've really thought of everything," he says.</p><p>"I promised to sweep you off your feet," Hokuto teases. He is hoping Juri takes it in good humor. He grabs two wine glasses from the cupboard, with a silent wish that he hasn't weirdly crossed any boundaries. As he discreetly observes Juri exploring the room, Hokuto also hopes that everything is fine between them and that all this is just a light and playful conclusion to their date.</p><p>*****</p><p>As the night goes on, they lie side by side on the bed. An open bottle of wine rests on the nightstand, softly illuminated by a nearby lamp. The TV screen plays a muted movie in front of them, casting shifting shadows on the walls.</p><p>"I must admit I was almost disappointed as I thought the date was already ending after the dinner," Juri says thoughtfully, his fingers tracing the curvature of the half-full wine glass.</p><p>Hokuto laughs nervously because he's not sure what else to say or how to react. It's not clear what Juri is trying to imply with his words.</p><p>"I'm sorry for almost ruining it," Hokuto then says.</p><p>"Stop saying sorry. The date continued, and this was a pleasant surprise. I just wasn't sure at first if the hotel invitation was a joke or not."</p><p>They hum, but it quickly dies out, and they fall into silence again.</p><p>Hokuto can sense that Juri is about to say something but changes his mind, clearly picking up the right words. Until he finally broaches a topic that he's clearly been holding onto.</p><p>"So, was this a fake date or a real one?" Juri asks bluntly, turning his head to look at Hokuto. It's a question that Hokuto has been mulling over as well.</p><p>Hokuto evades Juri's gaze for a moment, pondering his response.</p><p>"Maybe the idea started as a fake date," Hokuto begins slowly. "But somewhere along the way, it turned more or less real for me."</p><p>Juri's expression softens as he listens. "I guess I feel the same way," he confesses. "It's been a real date for me too."</p><p>"Or maybe it was a real date for me from the beginning."</p><p>"Same."</p><p>Hokuto breathes a sigh of relief and chuckles softly. Normally, a conversation like this might have been uncomfortable, but the easy, candid manner in which they've shared their thoughts has dissolved any potential awkwardness between them. The mishaps and misfortunes of the day begin to fade from Hokuto's mind, as well. Fortunately, Juri seems to share the same sentiment as he joins in the laughter, his eyes crinkling at the corners in that endearing way Hokuto has always admired.</p><p>"I can't believe this," Juri says. "That you felt the same way all the way. I mean, what was all that apologizing throughout the day? And not correcting me even once when I implied I'm unsure if it was pretending or not?"</p><p>"It's not like you were particularly clear either," Hokuto says, feeling the urge to defend himself a little bit. Although now, when reminiscing the evening, Juri's comments and his reactions were pretty clear, maybe Hokuto was just too afraid to let himself even think about the option that Juri could see it as something more than just a silly fake date between two friends.</p><p>Juri smiles warmly.</p><p>"Well then, since we've now agreed that this is a real date and I'm very much in a bed with my hot good-looking date, can I ask for a goodnight kiss then?"</p><p>Hokuto meets Juri's gaze, his heart racing in response to the sudden request.</p><p>"Oh," he says. "I think you've definitely earned one after bearing with all this hassle."</p><p>With a fluttering feeling in his stomach, Hokuto is the one inching closer to Juri, who remains pleasantly still. Hokuto's fingertips brush the side of Juri's face as he cradles it.</p><p>As Hokuto takes the final step, gently closing the gap between himself and Juri, their mouths touch softly and carefully. It's a deliberate tender kiss, their lips barely parted.</p><p>Hokuto's mind drifts back to the playful kisses they've shared before. Those have occurred mainly during fun nights with all the members after a few or more drinks.</p><p>They've had some wine this time, but it hasn't noticeably affected them. This kiss feels thoroughly different from all the previous ones. It seems more profound, more sincere. There are no jokes or light-headednessâ€”just a genuine moment of tenderness. For Hokuto, even if the date began as fake and many obstacles on the way were borderline funny and awkward, this particular moment doesn't feel fake, funny or awkward at all.</p><p>As they slowly part from their brief kiss, Hokuto doesn't immediately pull away but keeps his face close to Juri's.</p><p>Juri breaks the silence with a soft chuckle.</p><p>"That was a really nice goodnight kiss," he whispers against Hokuto's mouth. His smile exudes such warmth that it lights up his whole face, causing his eyes to gleam beautifully. Why is Juri so effortlessly charming from all angles, especially this close?</p><p>"Did that make up for the disastrous date?" Hokuto asks.</p><p>"Was it disastrous, in your opinion?"</p><p>"Well, yeah," Hokuto hums. "Things didn't go particularly well."</p><p>Juri's expression changes, and he looks somewhat amused.</p><p>"Okay, I have a confession, but you brought it up, so be prepared," he says. "The date itself actually was kind of horrible, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it at all because you were too nice to take me out in the first place. And well, in the end, I realized that I couldn't care less what kind of date we'd be having. Seriously, I'd have fun with you even at the dump pit."</p><p>Hokuto's lips curl into a smile. "Are you serious?"</p><p>"Yes. Hokuto, I like you, I like your company, and I really enjoyed going on a date with you, even a horrible one. And I really really enjoyed getting a goodnight kiss from you. Scew the romantic dates, I'm opting for some real romance if it's like this."</p><p>"Okay, since we're now there, I have a confession, as well," Hokuto says softly as he lifts his other hand up and tentatively strokes Juri's cheek with it. "I really liked giving you that goodnight kiss, so... could I also get one from you?"</p><p>"I was waiting for that."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Without saying anything to that, Juri puts his glass of wine behind him on the nightstand, wraps his arms behind Hokuto's shoulders, and pulls him closer to him again. His mouth finds Hokuto's, and Hokuto closes his eyes.</p><p>This time, their kiss is urgent, more hungry than tender, but that's fine with Hokuto. He matches Juri's intensity as Juri shifts them onto their sides. Juri's hands move lower, bringing their bodies closer.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around Juri's neck, Hokuto deepens the kiss. Juri's mouth is fervent, his hands firm on Hokuto's hips as their tongues meet.</p><p>Juri's hands peel off Hokuto's outer shirt, and Hokuto realizes they're on the same page. They break the kiss for a moment, so it gives them freedom to both take off their shirts and leave their upper bodies bare. They kiss again, and without breaking it, they manage to take off their pants and socks, leaving them on their underwear only.</p><p>"Tell me what you want," Hokuto manages to say, breaking the kiss again and breathing against Juri's mouth. "Can I-- would you like it if I sucked your dick?"</p><p>Juri makes a stifled, groaning noise. "Yes," he says hoarsely. "Please?"</p><p>Hokuto shifts to the edge of the bed, skimming his hands along Juri's body. Then he gently presses his nose against Juri's hip, taking a moment to breathe in Juri's scent. He softly kisses and teases Juri's erection through the fabric. Juri's hardened cock strains against the cloth, prompting Hokuto to lightly graze it with his mouth and tongue, breathing heavily, savoring the gentle contact.</p><p>"Hokuto, please," Juri groans, his voice strained.</p><p>Meeting Juri's gaze with a sly smile, Hokuto takes a moment to appreciate the scene from his vantage point. Juri's hands are clenched into tight fists, his bare chest bearing a slight flush.</p><p>"If you want, you can tug my hair," Hokuto murmurs. "I enjoy it."</p><p>"Just please," Juri moans desperately.</p><p>"I love seeing you like this," Hokuto says softly before gently pulling down Juri's underwear. Juri's hands find their place on Hokuto's head, fingers tenderly weaving through his hair.</p><p>As Juri tilts his head back, Hokuto allows himself to indulge, exploring, teasing, and delicately licking and sucking his dick until he discovers the precise actions that cause Juri to let out groans and quiver under Hokuto's touch. Then Hokuto takes Juri's cock into his mouth as far as he can, relishing the slight ache in his jaw. Juri's grip tightens, tugging at Hokuto's hair.</p><p>"Hokuto," Juri moans again. His tone sounds urgent as Hokuto keeps bopping his head.</p><p>Hokuto swears he himself could almost come just like this even without Juri touching him or him touching himself yet. Juri trembles beneath his touch and leans forward, steadying himself with a hand on Hokuto's shoulder. His breathing is so intense and forceful that it resonates throughout the room.</p><p>Then Juri seems to gather himself, signals Hokuto to halt, and swiftly pulls him up from the foot of the bed to face him again.</p><p>"I want to fuck you," Juri moans against his mouth. "Or wait, what, was that too blunt? Too sudden? After all this pretending--"</p><p>"I thought we already agreed that it's not pretending," Hokuto whispers as he kisses Juri again. Juri pulls Hokuto flush against himself and rolls them over. Then Juri's hands steady on either side of Hokuto on the bed, while his knees frame Hokuto's hips. His kisses are fervent, filled with nibbles and urgency, stealing every bit of breath from Hokuto. Memories of mishaps from their date blur completely, and Hokuto's focus narrows down to the helpless movement of his hips, silently yearning to be touched more.</p><p>Juri grazes his teeth down Hokuto's neck and continues trailing his mouth along Hokuto's chest while his hands travel along Hokuto's body and take away his underwear.</p><p>Juri uses one hand to raise Hokuto's leg over his shoulder, taking Hokuto's cock into his mouth. He continues with a fervent suction, the intense warmth and wetness enveloping Hokuto so intensely that he realizes he can't endure it for much longer. Gripping the sheets tightly, Hokuto senses the orgasm building dangerously in his lower stomach, but he resists letting go yet. Trying to sit up, he signals Juri to pause. As Hokuto prepares to stand, a gentle hand presses against his chest, urging him to lie back down.</p><p>"Stay like that," Juri commands. He then rises and quickly heads to his bag on the floor, returning to the bed with a tube of lube and a condom package in hand.</p><p>Hokuto gasps for breath because the sight is just too hot to handle. "Wow--," he begins, but Juri swiftly prepares his fingers and gently pushes Hokuto down again, holding him in position while simultaneously resuming his actions with his mouth and then pressing a finger inside him.</p><p>If Hokuto weren't so ensnared by Juri's hands, mouth, and the pressure of his body, he might consider speaking up, squirming, or somehow signaling Juri to carry on. However, he finds himself entirely immobilized. Completely captivated, Hokuto enjoys the feeling of Juri moving his finger inside him, adding another one soon after. At that moment, nothing else occupies Hokuto's thoughts; he's wholly absorbed in the tingling sensations coursing through his entire being, every part of his body trembling.</p><p>Juri nips at his neck, fingers tracing along his chest, his nipple as he works him open. That in itself feels too good. But Hokuto really wants more after all.</p><p>"Can you just--," Hokuto pleads.</p><p>"What do you want?" Juri asks. Hokuto shivers.</p><p>"Please," he mumbles, seizing Juri's wrist and pulling his fingers away. "Fuck me."</p><p>Juri moans at that. Hokuto observes Juri's face and caresses his chin. He looks so beautiful, so hot, and Hokuto can't resist but lean up to kiss him. And he keeps doing it until Juri has the condom on and guides himself inside behind Hokuto, who has turned to his side.</p><p>As Juri slowly enters, Hokuto shivers, and Juri lets out a moan against his neck. Encouraging Juri with a firm push on his ass, Hokuto urges him to press himself in fully.</p><p>In the heated moment, Juri thrusts into Hokuto as they lie on their sides. Sensing a need for even better access, Hokuto shifts onto his stomach, creating an arch that lets Juri fuck him deeper. Hokuto is caught up in the moment and grips the pillow under him as Juri's movements grow more and more intense with each thrust.</p><p>Hokuto feels an intense wave of pleasure rushing through him, and then he feels himself coming. As the orgasm peaks, his body fluctuates between intense warmth and a sudden chill, momentarily enveloping him in a kind of foggy sensation.</p><p>Not long after, Juri reaches his climax. He comes with a loud moan poured right against Hokuto's shoulder. He twitches inside Hokuto and jerks.</p><p>Hokuto struggles to recall how to breathe as he blinks his eyes open, realizing he can't even remember closing them. Juri's lips are pressed against his neck, nuzzling beneath his chin, teasingly grazing his teeth against the sensitive skin below his ear and tracing along his jawline with tender strokes.</p><p>"I," Hokuto starts, but then he can't remember what he was going to say.</p><p>"Mmmmh," Juri murmurs, nibbling on his ear.</p><p>"That was--"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Hokuto shuts his eyes once more.</p><p>Juri reclines beside him, yet one arm remains weightily draped across Hokuto's chest. Hokuto relishes the serenity of the moment, the soft hum of their breaths in sync. He opens his eyes and watches the play of their shadows dancing on the ceiling, letting a comfortable silence remain between them for several minutes. Juri's hand tracing light patterns on his skin feels like a soothing balm to his senses.</p><p>As they lie beside each other and their breaths have regulated, Hokuto finally brings up the second topic that he's been thinking about. Maybe some ordinary people would think it's not the right time for a moment like that, but he and Juri are far from ordinary in the first place. That's what he's noticed even long before this date.</p><p>"I don't think I even had an idea myself how long I've wanted this to happen," Hokuto confesses.</p><p>"Yeah," Juri says. "And I wouldn't mind if it were to happen again."</p><p>"I wouldn't mind either," Hokuto responds honestly.</p><p>Juri gazes at Hokuto, his eyes reflecting sincerity but also a little bit of reservation.</p><p>"But let's take this at our pace?" he suggests softly. "I haven't changed my thoughts about not rushing into finding a partner, settling down, getting married, and all that."</p><p>Hokuto nods in understanding. "Don't worry. I'm still the dull workaholic. Let's take it slowly." A wry smile forms on Juri's lips because of the joke.</p><p>"You're never dull, all the opposite. Perfect date," Juri says.</p><p>Hokuto can't help but feel a tad bashful because he's not used to getting those kinds of compliments. Or maybe it's not that he never gets compliments, but knowing how to respond is a whole different game. It's like someone gifting him a shiny but confusing gadget - a cool present, but the user manual is missing.</p><p>"So?"</p><p>Juri is still clearly waiting for any answer or reaction as he keeps looking at Hokuto.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts again, Hokuto finds the situation slightly amusing, hoping Juri doesn't take it the wrong way. That's just how he tends to be. He chuckles, mainly for himself and his own quirks. Despite all that, Juri still seems to like him, and that's what matters.</p><p>"Let's go on another date as soon as possible," Hokuto concludes.</p><p>Juri grins. "And then another?"</p><p>"Yes, and then another. But this time, it's your turn to take the lead and plan everything."</p><p>"No worries, I already know your dull preferencesâ€”let's listen to Howl's Moving Castle in my car, followed by some average sukiyaki dinner. What an easy person to please."</p><p>"You're impossible," Hokuto teases. But instead of nudging Juri, he wraps an arm around him, pulling him close.</p><p>Juri plants a kiss on his cheek, and Hokuto swears the date was a success after all.</p><p>*****</p><p>It's another day of filming yet another YouTube video. The six of them are crammed into a company's van, chatter bouncing off the car walls. Hokuto takes a better position in the middle next to Jesse. They're in the middle of an <em>introdon</em> game, once again, and it seems to amuse all of them.</p><p>"Hey, guys," Juri interjects, pulling the attention of his bandmates towards the backseat, where he's seated next to Shintaro. "Hokuto and I hung out on our day off and played this game."</p><p>"Oh, really? Just the two of you?" Kochi asks behind the steering wheel.</p><p>"It was the best thing ever!" Juri says. His eyes are shimmering as Hokuto turns to watch him. "We went driving, and in the end, we ended up playing <em>introdon</em> together spontaneously out of nowhere."</p><p>"That sounds a bit gross, to be honest!" Shintaro comments, Jesse's laughter accompanying him. "I mean, who does that kind of stuff when there are only two people involved?"</p><p>Juri laughs, but he still keeps going. "And then we did even crazier stuff. We listened to the Princess Mononoke movie while driving!"</p><p>"How does that work?" Taiga asks from the front seat.</p><p>"We only had the audio, no chance to watch the movie itself, so we turned it into an auditory experience," Juri explains, his tone raising with remembered excitement. "Like tuning in to a podcast!"</p><p>More laughter bubbles through the car, and everyone agrees it sounds absurd.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles along but finds himself immersed in the shared memory. It was indeed a great day, although not their last date with Juri. Nor the second-to-last. In fact, there have been plenty of dates since then.</p><p>Juri, undeterred, continues his storytelling spree. "Then we went for some yakiniku, but the grill flame was so weak it was a bit of a disaster. We ate anyway and then called it a night."</p><div class="text-orange-500 markdown prose w-full break-words dark">
<p>Hokuto hums to himself, relieved that Juri didn't go further with his revelations. Honestly, certain explicit details are better left reserved for their private moments and not meant to be shared in front of ten cameras.</p>
</div><p>*****</p><p>"You made it sound to our members as if we had an awkward time together," Hokuto says later to Juri as he unbuckles his seat belt. Juri has driven him home, and they're now in front of Hokuto's apartment building.</p><p>"But I didn't mention anything about it being awkward!" Juri says, smiling. "If they took it like that, they just don't understand the charm of dull things, and that's their loss."</p><p>Hokuto is rather satisfied that their members haven't asked about Juri's desire for more romance in his life. Perhaps they are simply assuming that Juri's earlier lament about romance and dates was, once again, just a passing phaseâ€”a moment of emotional outburst replaced by another silly thing Juri can dramatically whine about.</p><p>The truth is that Juri has plenty of romance in his life now, and there's no need for more silly dates. Despite his busy schedule that hasn't magically disappeared anywhere, Hokuto still manages to find time to slip into Juri's apartment, whether during the day or for a nighttime visit. During these two intense weeks, they've more than explored various positions, different places, and very diverse ways to have sex. Juri certainly isn't devoid of romance, even if their meetings don't happen in public spaces, and there are no talks about boyfriend-boyfriend-thing or anything more serious. Which is pretty perfect like that, and Hokuto isn't willing to change how things are for now.</p><p>"Whatever," Hokuto hums.</p><p>As he steps out of the car, he glances back at Juri. "Thanks for the ride. See you tomorrow."</p><p>Juri nods, his smile still in place. "Yeah, see you."</p><p>Hokuto has come to the conclusion that he's just not the type for planning top-notch dates. He's more than happy to let other people take charge in that department in the future.</p><p>But hey, if there was a contest for offering some great romance, he's pretty sure he'd be a top contender with how things are going between them.</p><p>With the way Juri beams at him, Hokuto feels like he's on a good track for a gold medal.</p>
