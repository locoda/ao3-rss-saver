    <h2 class="toc-heading">love in panels</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>As Yugo sits in the quiet confines of the publishing company, his eyes flicker across the blank pages of his sketchbook. It’s past one in the afternoon, and the usual bustling energy that fills the building has dwindled to a hushed symphony of scribbling pencils and rustling papers. Everyone is engrossed in their work, striving to meet the looming deadline for the latest chapter of the manga.</p><p>Yugo’s position as an assistant to Aiba Masaki, a renowned manga artist, has brought him to this point in his career. Yet, he can’t help but feel trapped in his role. He had just graduated a year ago, but he yearns for his childhood dream of creating his own manga, of leaving his mark on the world with stories that resonates deeply with readers. But for now, he remains the faithful assistant, fulfilling Aiba’s requests with unwavering professionalism.</p><p>However, today is different. Yugo has managed to finish his assigned tasks earlier, granting him a rare pocket of time to chase his own aspirations. Frustration coils within him as he stares at the empty pages before him. Yugo yearns for inspiration, for the perfect story that will showcase his talent and prove to his parents that he had made the right choice by pursuing manga against their wishes.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, Yugo doesn’t notice Masaki’s approach until his voice pierces through the veil of his contemplation.</p><p>“Yugo! Yoohoo, what’s the matter?” he asks, his voice laced with concern.</p><p>Startled, Yugo looks up to find his boss’ wide eyes peering at him, the creases on his face deepening with empathy. “S-Sorry,” he mutters, hiding his sketchbook. Like it was any use, because nothing is even sketched in it.</p><p>Aiba glances at the sketchbook and nods. “Coming up with something for your manga?” he guesses.</p><p>Yugo nods. “I’m just … I can’t seem to come up with a story,” he confesses, frustration lingering in his voice.</p><p>Aiba’s gaze softens, and he settles down next to Yugo, his presence a comforting weight. “Ah, the elusive story. The hardest part of the manga,” he muses. “Well, if you want to start, a romance story always works. And sells.”</p><p>Yugo scoffs, his frustration now mingling with disbelief. “Romance? <em>Sensei</em>, I haven’t been in a relationship for years. How can I create something I don’t even understand?”</p><p>A knowing smile graces Aiba’s lips as he leans closer, his voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. “Ah, Yugo, inspiration for romance is all around us. Look at the world, observe people, and feel their emotions. Love, heartbreak, longing — they’re the threads that weave our lives together.”</p><p>He blinks as he lets the words sink in. “<em>Sensei</em> … that’s uncharacteristically poetic of you.”</p><p>Aiba laughs. “I know, right? That just came to mind — Wait, maybe I should use that for the next chapter!” He rises to his feet and places a hand on Yugo’s shoulder. “Yugo, you have the talent and the passion. Don’t force it, but maybe open yourself to experiences, too.”</p><p>With those parting words, Aiba leaves Yugo to his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo takes another sip of his beer, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat. It had been a long day at work, and he needs something to help him unwind. As he sits in his small apartment, the silence envelops me. Living alone has its perks, but it also means there’s no one to share the quiet moments with.</p><p>Glancing at the clock on the wall, Yugo notices it’s already 11:25 PM. The summer nights in Tokyo seem to stretch on forever, the air heavy with humidity.</p><p>He sighs as he stretches. It had been a week since he had tried coming up with a romance story — anything, just to get started — but nothing comes to mind.</p><p>His laptop is open in a desperate attempt to Google ways to experience romance. But his options are limited. No one in the office piques his interest, and his hectic schedule at the company leaves little time for him to meet new people.</p><p>Yugo scrolls through various articles and forums, hoping to find a solution. Meeting someone online doesn’t appeal to him, and he doesn’t have any old friends from his school days whom he can suddenly reach out to for a date. Frustration gnaws at him as he wonders if he’ll ever find a way to experience romance.</p><p>And then, as if fate has heard his silent plea, Yugo stumbles upon an article about rental boyfriends. The idea intrigues him. It offers a chance to experience romance without the burden of long-term commitment. He clicks on the website mentioned in the article, finding a section that caters specifically to gay men.</p><p>With a mix of apprehension and excitement, Yugo signs up on the website. His fingers tremble slightly as he enters his details, creating a profile. The questions on the form seem invasive, asking about his preferences and desires. It feels strange to lay out his needs so explicitly, but he’s come this far and wants to give it a chance.</p><p>As Yugo submits his profile, a wave of uncertainty washes over him. Is this the right decision? Will renting a boyfriend really provide the romantic experience he needs to create a story? He knows it’s an unconventional path, but at that moment, it feels like the only option available to him.</p><p>Yugo closes his laptop, the weight of his decision settling in the stillness of the apartment. The room seems to hold its breath, waiting for what will come next. The hum of the city outside filters through the windows, the distant sounds of life reminding him that the city is teeming with possibilities.</p><p>With a determined glint in his eyes, Yugo stands up and finishes his beer in one gulp. It’s time to get that inspiration, even if it means stepping outside his comfort zone and embracing the unknown.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Yugo wakes up the next day, the rental boyfriend app tells him that it has found a list of potential boyfriends based on his preferences. He spends the rest of the morning scrolling through the thumbnails of the photos of the boyfriends, as well as their ages. A click on the profile tells him their ideal dates and answers to other cheesy questions that ideally would make one swoon.</p><p>Unable to make up his mind, Yugo chooses the easiest path and sorts the list according to the highest-ranking rental boyfriends. The thumbnails rearrange, and Yugo clicks on the profile of the rental boyfriend with a 5.0 ranking.</p><p>His name is “Jesse.” 184 cm. Blonde, poodle-like curls. A bright smile. A quick look of his face, and Yugo can tell that he’s of mixed race. It doesn’t matter because he’s attractive enough to have Yugo staring at his profile picture for a few more seconds than the other rental boyfriends on the app.</p><p>Well, that’s a good sign. He’s attracted to Jesse, so that should suffice to ask him out, right?</p><p>Yugo takes a deep breath and clicks the “Ask on a Date” button below the photo.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The summer sun bathes the park in a warm glow as Yugo anxiously waits on a wooden bench. His heart flutters with a mix of anticipation and uncertainty. He adjusts his collar, then his fingers tap nervously on his sketchbook. Glancing at his watch, he realizes it’s almost noon. Jesse, the rental boyfriend he has hired, should be arriving any moment now.</p><p>Suddenly, amidst the bustling crowd, Yugo’s eyes catch sight of a figure approaching him. His heart skips a beat as he sees Jesse, with the way his blonde hair and a captivating smile that can melt hearts. Time seems to slow down as their eyes meet.</p><p>“Yugo?” Jesse calls out, his voice filled with a touch of excitement and curiosity.</p><p>Yugo can only nod, momentarily speechless by Jesse’s mere presence. As Jesse settles beside him, the air becomes charged with an unspoken electricity, and Yugo feels his heart racing.</p><p>Breaking the silence, Jesse smiles warmly. “Shall we go on our picnic, then?” His voice carries a playful tone, infectious with enthusiasm.</p><p>Yugo, finally finding his voice, replies, “Yeah, let’s go. I made some sandwiches. I hope you like them.”</p><p>Jesse’s smile widens. “I’m sure I will.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, trying to suppress the blush in his cheeks. No wonder he’s the highest-rating rental boyfriend in the app. He can flatter up a storm.</p><p>As they stroll through the park, the sound of their laughter fills the air. Yugo finds himself effortlessly drawn to Jesse’s magnetic charisma, his energy contagious. For the first time in a long while, Yugo feels a spark awakening within him.</p><p>Settling down beneath the shade of a tree, they lay out the neatly packed picnic basket. Yugo hands Jesse a sandwich, their fingers brushing against each other ever so slightly. Their eyes lock for a moment, a silent understanding passing between them.</p><p>Jesse takes a bite of the sandwich, savoring the flavors. “This is amazing!”</p><p>Yugo blushes. “Flatterer.”</p><p>“No, I’m serious! This is really good!”</p><p>Their conversation flows effortlessly. Yugo feels himself opening up, sharing his dreams, his passions, and even his fears. Jesse listens attentively, his eyes filled with genuine interest and compassion.</p><p>Hours fly by like fleeting seconds, and soon the sun begins its descent, casting a golden hue across the park. Yugo glances at Jesse, realizing the reality of their situation — that Jesse is a rental boyfriend, a temporary companion meant to fulfill a fantasy. The gazes they share aren’t something profound — Jesse knows what his clients want and need, and he needs to for his job.</p><p>“Something wrong, Yugo?”</p><p>Yugo returns to reality and finds Jesse looking at him with furrowed brows. If he knows any better, Jesse is genuinely worried about him.</p><p>He manages a smile and shakes his head. “Yeah. Totally okay,” he replies, completely not trusting his own voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s heart races as he waits outside the bustling concert hall. The summer breeze carries the excited chatter of the crowd, and he can’t help but feel a mix of anticipation and nerves.</p><p>This is his sixth date with Jesse. With each passing encounter, Yugo finds himself drawn to Jesse in a way he hasn’t expected.</p><p>But then again, the dates are working. Yugo’s sketchbook is now full of character sketches and possible plot ideas. There’s still no solid plot, but at least there’s something.</p><p>Jesse approaches, his face lighting up with a bright smile. “You look amazing,” he remarks.</p><p>Yugo returns his smile, his face heating up. “I should say the same to you.” Even if Jesse’s wearing just a simple white dress shirt and black pants, he looks like he can be walking on the runway anytime.</p><p>As they enter the concert hall, the lights dim, and the stage comes alive with a burst of vibrant colors and melodies. Yugo can’t help but be mesmerized by the grandeur of it all, his gaze occasionally drifting to Jesse, who seems equally captivated.</p><p>During a quiet moment between songs, Yugo turns to Jesse, a random question in his mind. “Do you ever feel overwhelmed by your dreams? Like you have this burning passion, but you’re not sure if you can make it a reality?”</p><p>Jesse’s eyes meet Yugo’s, filled with a mix of understanding and empathy. “All the time?”</p><p>Yugo blinks, realizing that all this time, he had told Jesse a bit about himself. He never returned the favor. “What’s your dream, Jesse?”</p><p>Jesse looks surprised at the question, but he smiles. “I want to act,” he says. “I’ve done a couple of commercials here and there, but all I want is to be onstage in a musical.”</p><p>Somehow, Yugo can see it, and he smiles as he imagines Jesse’s energy onstage at the concert hall. “That would be amazing.”</p><p>Jesse grins. “It’s been years, but I keep going for every audition I could come across,” he says. “Sometimes the only thing holding us back is our own doubt. You’re making a manga, right?” When Yugo nods, he continues. “You have an incredible talent, and I believe in you.”</p><p>Yugo’s heart skips a beat at Jesse’s words, his doubts momentarily silenced by the sincerity in his voice. He reaches out to take Jesse’s hand in his own. For a fleeting moment, their fingers intertwine, and Yugo feels an unspoken connection that goes beyond the realm of rented companionship.</p><p>But reality crashes back down, and the lights at the concert hall go back on. Yugo reluctantly releases Jesse’s hand. Jesse’s expression is neutral as he waits for him to gather his things before they walk out of the concert hall, the night alive with the sounds of the city.</p><p>He has to remind himself that this is just a rental date, a temporary arrangement devoid of any genuine emotions. But with each passing moment, it becomes harder to ignore the connection they’re forming.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The local festival is in full swing, vibrant lanterns illuminating the night sky with a warm glow. Yugo and Jesse stroll through the bustling crowds, their hands occasionally brushing against each other’s, a subtle yet undeniable connection.</p><p>As they approach a food stall, Yugo’s eyes widen with childlike excitement. “Takoyaki!” he exclaims, pointing at the sizzling balls of octopus-filled goodness.</p><p>Jesse chuckles, his eyes sparkling with amusement. “Someone’s excited.”</p><p>Yugo nods enthusiastically. “I can never resist them.”</p><p>They buy a plate’s worth and find a quiet spot near a tree, its orange and gold leaves gently falling around them. Yugo sighs, the weight of his dreams heavy on his shoulders as he remembers what happened at the office yesterday.</p><p>“What’s bothering you, Yugo?” Jesse asks softly, his voice laced with concern.</p><p>Yugo hesitates for a moment, his eyes scanning the festival’s vibrant atmosphere. “I’m lost again,” he says. “I showed my plot to my boss, and even if he’s usually nice, he was pretty harsh in my critique. And now I’m lost.”</p><p>Jesse leans closer, his gaze steady yet filled with empathy. “I’m sorry,” he says, running a hand up and down his back. “It can be frustrating, but it doesn’t mean you’re any less capable of creating something amazing.”</p><p>Yugo sighs, his shoulders relaxing under the weight of Jesse’s words. “It’s just … I want to tell stories that touch people’s hearts, like all the manga I grew up reading. But what if I never find that story? What if I’m stuck forever as someone’s assistant?”</p><p>Jesse’s hand reaches out, gently taking hold of Yugo’s. “You have to believe in yourself,” he says reassuringly. “You have a passion that shines through in everything you do. And I’m sure one day, you’ll create a story that’ll touch lots of lives.”</p><p>Yugo bites his bottom lip, emotions threatening to spill out of him. “Thank you, Jesse. You always know what to say.”</p><p>Jesse’s thumb gently wipes something on the edge of Yugo’s lips. “Takoyaki sauce,” he explains, his cheeks pink. “And that’s what I’m here for, Yugo. To support you and remind you of your worth.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Why did you want to become an actor?”</p><p>The crisp air envelops the streets as they embark on their thirteenth rented date. Jesse’s warm smile illuminates the cool October afternoon. Yugo can’t help but admire the way the sunlight caresses his features, accentuating the gentle curves of his face. It’s in these moments that the line between fiction and reality seem to blur.</p><p>Jesse’s voice carries a gentle vulnerability as he speaks. “It’s been a dream of mine since I was a kid,” he says. “There was a musical I watched for school. <em>West Side Story</em>. I wanted to play the male lead.</p><p>“But it’s not an easy road. The industry can be pretty intense, and there are so many people vying for the same spotlight. It’s easy to feel a bit lost in the crowd sometimes, you know?”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes widen, his gaze searching Jesse’s face for any hint of doubt. But there’s none. Instead, he sees an unwavering determination, a flicker of passion that mirrors his own.</p><p>“You know, Jesse,” he says in a hushed tone, his voice quivering with emotion, “it really takes guts to go after your dreams. You’ll make it far, believe me.”</p><p>Jesse’s face lights up with a grateful smile, and he blinks. He clasps Yugo’s hands, intertwining their fingers.</p><p>The wind gently rustles the trees, and Yugo can’t resist the call of inspiration. In that peaceful autumn scene, love has come knocking at his door when he least expected it. And as they walk together, their footsteps in perfect harmony, Yugo realizes that the memories they create will be forever woven into the fabric of his heart.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo stands in front of the grand entrance of the museum, his heart pounding with anticipation. The air is crisp with the scent of autumn, and the trees surrounding the museum display a breathtaking array of vibrant colors.</p><p>As Yugo approaches, he spots Jesse waiting by the fountain, dressed in a stylish ensemble that perfectly complements his handsome features. The sunlight filtering through the foliage gives Jesse an almost ethereal glow. Yugo’s breath catches in his throat, his emotions swirling within him like a tempest.</p><p>It’s their fourteenth date together. Yugo is torn between wanting to take a step further in their relationship or keeping quiet lest he gets his heart broken.</p><p>Jesse spots him. “Hey!” he greets with a warm smile, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “Ready?”</p><p>Yugo nods, his voice catching in his throat. He can’t help but marvel at Jesse’s charm and the way he effortlessly lights up the world around him. They had come so far since their first encounter, and yet, Yugo’s feelings grow stronger with every passing day.</p><p>They enter the museum, their steps resonating softly on the marble floors. The hushed whispers of fellow visitors mingle with the soft strains of classical music playing in the background. The room is adorned with masterpieces, each brushstroke carrying the weight of an artist’s soul.</p><p>As Yugo and Jesse stroll through the gallery, Yugo’s gaze keeps drifting toward Jesse’s profile. He’s captivated by the way Jesse’s eyes sparkle with curiosity, his genuine interest in every piece of art they encounter. Yugo feels a flicker of inspiration ignite within him, the kindling of a story yet untold.</p><p>But amidst the beauty that surrounds them, a wave of conflict washes over Yugo. Jesse’s merely a rental boyfriend, a temporary fixture in his life. How can he allow himself to fall for someone who will eventually disappear? The ache in his heart grows unbearable.</p><p>Unable to bear the weight of his emotions any longer, Yugo halts when they reach a quiet corner of the museum, his gaze fixed on Jesse’s bewitching eyes. “Jesse,” he begins, his voice quivering. “I can’t keep pretending anymore. I like you.”</p><p>Jesse’s expression softens, his eyes reflecting both surprise and understanding. “Yugo,” he whispers, reaching out to gently cup Yugo’s cheek. “I’ve been feeling the same way. It’s hard not to when we’ve shared so much together.”</p><p>Their connection intensifies, the air around them thick with unspoken longing. And in that moment, with the weight of their unrequited desires pressing against their chests, Yugo and Jesse lean in, their lips meeting.</p><p>Time seems to stand still as their mouths meld together, their souls intertwining in a whirlwind of emotions. The world around them fades away, leaving only the echoes of their shared desire.</p><p>When they finally pull apart, their eyes lock in a silent promise. Jesse’s gaze is too intense that Yugo’s face heats up as he looks down. Jesse laughs fondly, wrapping him in an embrace.</p><p>“I can stop my part-time job, Yugo,” Jesse whispers against his hair. “I can’t pretend to date around other people while dating you.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Yugo asks. He doesn’t want to see Jesse dating other people, but he can’t have Jesse lose his job. “What about your job?”</p><p>“I can look for another one.” Jesse pulls away and presses a kiss on Yugo’s forehead. “I’m already part-timing someplace anyway?”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>Jesse grins. “Yeah, at a non-profit,” he replies. “I’ll see if I can ask for a full-time job.” His gaze softens. “I want to make this work, Yugo. Can you trust me?”</p><p>Yugo pauses before nodding. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s heart flutters as he watches the golden leaves dance in the crisp autumn breeze. The vibrant colors of the city paint a picturesque backdrop for his newfound romance with Jesse. They stroll hand in hand through the bustling streets, their steps in sync with the rhythm of the city.</p><p>As they stroll through the serene gardens, Yugo’s mind is filled with all sorts of emotions and thoughts. The autumn leaves’ enchanting colors reflect the whirlwind of feelings inside him, and he’s amazed at how effortlessly Jesse fits into the picture he had imagined.</p><p>Yugo initially thought hiring a rental boyfriend would simply serve as inspiration for his manga, a means to create a romantic story. But with each passing moment spent with Jesse, Yugo discovers that their bond goes beyond the realms of fiction.</p><p>Their footsteps lead them to a serene park, where a gentle stream meanders through the trees. Yugo stares at the water, lost in his own thoughts, getting lost in those ripples. He marvels at how Jesse had quit his job as a rental boyfriend, choosing instead to immerse himself fully in their shared moments. It’s as if Jesse has sensed the profound impact they’re having on each other, just as Yugo has felt it deep in his bones.</p><p>“You okay?” Jesse asks, brows furrowed with worry.</p><p>Yugo smiles and blushes, realizing he had been lost in his thoughts for too long. “Just thinking,” he admits. “About us?”</p><p>“What about us?” Jesse wraps an arm around his waist and pulls him close.</p><p>Yugo can’t help but steal glances at Jesse, his eyes tracing the contours of his face, the way his lips curve into a gentle smile. With each passing day, Yugo finds himself drawn deeper into his boyfriend’s — <em>boyfriend</em>! — world, a world that seems to hold the key to his inspiration.</p><p>In that brief moment, Yugo realizes that real inspiration doesn’t just come from imagination, but from personal experiences, too. With Jesse by his side, he has found a muse like no other — a love that will fuel his manga with a passion that can only come from their deep connection.</p><p>Yugo’s smile widens. “How much I like this right now.”</p><p>Jesse hums, leaning in for a kiss. “Me, too,” he whispers as he pulls away before he dives back in, kissing him again.</p><p>And as the sun sets, Yugo knows that their story is only just starting.</p>
