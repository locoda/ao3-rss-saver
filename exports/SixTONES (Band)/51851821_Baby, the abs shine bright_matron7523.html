<div class="userstuff">
<p>The way inside was always hard. It wasn't about the physical ascent to the second floor but rather the mental push that accompanied it and made the steps feel heavy.</p><p>Once again, Taiga found himself standing right outside the entrance of the gym, feeling a wave of nervousness welling up inside him and fighting off the feeling just to give up, turn around, go back home, and never return.</p><p>"Alright, no need to stress. You've got this," he reassured himself in a hushed tone. He took a deep breath to steady his nerves before finally mustering the courage to step inside.</p><p>As he yanked the door open, he was greeted by the sounds of clanging weights and the energetic chatter of gym-goers.</p><p>Since he hadn't been to the gym that many times, he still felt a bit like he didn't quite belong. It felt like everyone there was watching him with judging eyes, whatever he did or didn't.</p><p>But Taiga was more than determined to make his sports skills better, so he tried his best to ignore the uncomfortable feeling. He had already faced the second worst thing and had come there, but the worst thing was--</p><p>His personal trainer strolled over, and Taiga was relieved he could keep his expression somewhat in check. Jesse looked particularly impressive that day, with his exposed arms and a snug red shirt outlining his muscles. Then again, who was Taiga trying to trick there. Jesse was undeniably a striking sight all the time. No matter what the day held, he looked impressive.</p><p>At the same time, Taiga couldn't help but once again feel a bit too self-conscious about his own appearance.</p><p>"Hey, Taiga. Ready to kick things off today?"</p><p>Jesse's voice was easygoing and friendly, just like his whole aura was whenever he was present. The way he used Taiga's first name sent a little twist through Taiga's stomach.</p><p>Taiga nodded. "Yeah, ready as I'll ever be!"</p><p>He wanted to slap himself for sounding overly eager. Idiot.</p><p>A few weeks ago, when Chaka had suggested that Taiga should do something for his poor sports skills, he probably didn’t expect Taiga to develop a full-blown crush on his personal trainer as well. In record time, Taiga managed to transform every workout into a ridiculously intense mental tug-of-war between sit-ups and bicep-induced daydreams.</p><p>Who knew that getting fit could come with such a side dish of distraction?</p><p>Jesse led Taiga to the training area, initiating their session with straightforward warm-up exercises.</p><p>As always, Taiga found himself stumbling a bit. His movements must have appeared awkward next to Jesse's smooth grace. Coordination wasn't exactly Taiga's strong suit to begin with, but today brought an extra layer of challenge.</p><p>It was hard to say if the exercises were more challenging than usual - or if Jesse's bare arms were the distracting culprit.</p><p>"Okay, since it's Sunday, let's start with some squats," Jesse instructed, demonstrating the perfect form. "Feet shoulder-width apart, chest up, and lower down like you're sitting in a chair. Keep your knees in line with your toes, and push through your heels as you stand back up. Give it a shot, and I'll help you with the form."</p><p>Taiga attempted to mimic him, but he wobbled like a newborn fawn.</p><p>"I've never been good at sports," he admitted with a sheepish expression. He had already said that to Jesse a couple of times, but he still felt the need to explain himself a little bit.</p><p>"No worries, we'll work on that, and that's why you're here. It's all about practice," Jesse reassured him, flashing another heart-stopping smile. He gestured for Taiga to try again.</p><p>It was still as bad as the first one.</p><p>Jesse observed Taiga's second attempt with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"Hmm, your posture needs some adjustment. Mind you if I touch you a little bit?"</p><p>Taiga tried his best to maintain a straight face. "Yes, please, of course! I mean-- no, it's fine, go ahead."</p><p>Jesse approached and gently placed one hand on Taiga's belly while the other rested firmly against his lower back.</p><p>"You're doing great. You just need to remember to engage your core and then-," Jesse started explaining something about the importance of the inner abdominal muscles.</p><p>Unfortunately, the words seemed to vanish into thin air as Taiga found himself more focused on the feeling of Jesse's strong hands than the actual words being said. It was crazy how he got distracted so easily every single time, as if his brain had a built-in gay mode that chose the most inconvenient moments to activate. Fortunately, Jesse appeared oblivious to Taiga's internal chaos and continued with the explanation until he released his hands and turned to face Taiga.</p><p>"Okay?" Jesse asked.</p><p>"Sure," Taiga replied quickly, though he had no clue what he was actually agreeing to.</p><p>They moved on to lunges next, and Taiga's legs already felt like jelly.</p><p>Jesse demonstrated the lunges with a confident finesse, effortlessly showcasing the proper form. He stepped forward, lowering his body until both knees formed right angles. Taiga observed the scene, thinking it looked deceptively easy.</p><p>But as he tentatively attempted to replicate the maneuver, he couldn't shake the feeling that his version seemed more like a comedy routine than any fitness exercise. His legs quivered, and his balance teetered on the edge of uncertainty. But once again, Jesse offered only gentle corrections and words of encouragement.</p><p>"You're getting there! Just focus on stepping forward, and don't forget to breathe."</p><p>That was easy to say from him.</p><p>"Are you sure these movements are humanly possible for me?" Taiga asked, trying to catch his breath as he realized he indeed had been holding it quite intensively.</p><p>Jesse chuckled. "Trust me, you'll get the hang of it. Just keep going!"</p><p>As the training session continued, Taiga found himself appreciating Jesse's encouraging nature more and more. Every time Jesse corrected his form or wobbly steps, Taiga surely felt embarrassed but, at the same time, so grateful for his trainer's patience. Jesse's friendliness motivated Taiga, and, if he was totally honest, it managed to make his crush even stronger. How could someone be so nice even when dealing with a total mess like him?
</p><p>As they were approaching the end of the session, there was still the sit-up segment left. Jesse positioned himself at Taiga's feet, playing the role of a supportive anchor. With each sit-up, Taiga's eyes inevitably met Jesse's, causing a little flutter in his chest. Despite the awkward closeness, Jesse's encouraging words and friendly face made the embarrassment worthwhile.</p><p>Absentmindedly, Taiga wondered when that beautiful day would come when he'd gather enough courage to ask Jesse out.</p><p>*****</p><p>By the end of the session, Taiga was utterly exhausted.</p><p>"You're doing great, Taiga. I can see the progress already," Jesse said, giving him a pat on the back as they stood up after stretching.</p><p>Glancing at himself in the gym mirror, Taiga couldn't help but acknowledge that he looked pretty disgusting. He was a far cry from those tall, statuesque, muscle-bound guys who exuded a modest drop or two of sweat on their chiseled chests and foreheads after their workout sessions. No, Taiga's post-exercise aesthetic leaned more toward the hues of a traffic light than the sleek sheen of an athlete in their prime.</p><p>Taiga took a sip of water, watching as Jesse thoughtfully scribbled some notes on the folder he held, probably something about his client being a lost cause.</p><p>"Thanks Jesse, for today," Taiga said, trying to sound casual despite wanting to say so much more. Maybe apologize because he still couldn't shake off the embarrassing feeling thoroughly.</p><p>Jesse only smiled. "My pleasure! Like I said, you've really improved already. I'm sure we can move on to bigger weights next week."</p><p>"I promise I'll show you the best of me then."</p><p>Jesse's smile remained warm. "Looking forward to it. See you next time, Taiga."</p><p>As if on cue, Jesse moved to bow and then wave in his friendly way. Within his movement, he seemingly unintentionally revealed the contents of his folder to Taiga's eyes quickly.</p><p>The moment was long enough for Taiga's eyes to catch a small heart drawn next to his name on the paper. But before Taiga's brain could fully process it, Jesse had already turned around.</p><p>A confusing fluttering feeling remained in Taiga's chest as he started walking in the opposite direction, heading towards the dressing room to change.</p><p>As he reached for the door, his gaze instinctively turned one more time. There, he spotted Jesse halted in the middle of the corridor, engrossed in a lively conversation with his personal trainer friend, Morimoto. Seeing Jesse so happy somehow made Taiga feel pretty content too.</p><p>Then, Jesse sent a quick glance in Taiga's direction over Morimoto's shoulder and smiled at him.</p><p>A warm and fuzzy feeling spread inside Taiga, and suddenly, his feet didn't feel as heavy as they did just a moment ago.</p><p>Getting a personal trainer had been a great idea.</p>
