<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>First time to write here.<br/>This is inspired by the wink up article. Wherein Hokuto notices that Taiga takes off his jacket when he boards the train and Taiga says they rarely commute together. (How did Hokuto notice it then?)

<p>That's a wrap!<br/>
Otsukare everyone!<br/>
Their director yelled signalling the end of their YouTube shoot for the day.</p><p>They all went back to their dressing room to get their personal belongings.</p><p>Kochi invited everyone to have dinner together but only Jesse agreed as Juri and Shin excused themselves as they still had to shoot for the game channel.</p><p>Taiga on the other hand declined as he still had to wake up early the next day for a shoot. He decided to plug in his earphones and walk to the station. While he is on the train he's just catching up on One Piece episodes on his ipad.</p><p>After a while the guy beside him taps him and just points at the station they are currently in and the doors are closing. In his panic, he immediately stood up and went for the door. As his left foot bumped the closing door, he tripped.<br/>
Lucky for him it wasn't particularly crowded. However his glasses fell off and he can't see. He noticed someone put his glasses on his hand. As he wore the glasses, and was about to say thank you to the guy he was shocked.</p><p>Taiga: Hokuto? What are you doing here?<br/>
Hokuto: I'm helping you up?<br/>
Taiga: Yes. I see that. But isn't your station to the other side?<br/>
Hokuto: and here's your jacket. You dropped it at the train before you got off. Now you're good to go. Bye.</p><p>Taiga managed to hold Hokuto's hand before he ran away.</p><p>Taiga: Don't run away Hokuto. Just tell me the truth.<br/>
Hokuto: okay but please don't be mad.<br/>
Taiga: I won't be.<br/>
Hokuto: well, I was worried cause I know you are watching on the train and you tend to not notice everything around you. I just thought it's dangerous so I have been following you just so I can be sure you will be home safely.<br/>
Taiga: wait, have been?? How many days have you been doing this?<br/>
Hokuto: past 2 weeks?<br/>
Taiga: weeks?? Hokuto i'm not a child. I can handle myself.<br/>
Hokuto: really? You almost missed your stop every single day. I was lucky for you not to notice me every time I remind you of your stop.</p><p>Now Taiga realizes, the man in the train, how did he know his station. And the weird noise he hears that distracts him from his ipad or random people bumping into him whenever he is near his station. They are always wearing masks and their face is covered.</p><p>Taiga: that was all you?<br/>
Hokuto: yes.<br/>
Taiga: why didn't you just approach me normally?<br/>
Hokuto: i thought you wouldn't like it if it was me<br/>
Taiga: oh Hokuto. Thank you for worrying about me. But next time, just tell me normally instead of acting like some kind of stalker.<br/>
Hokuto: i'm sorry.<br/>
Taiga: it's okay. Now take me home and let me make you something for dinner to thank you for everything you've done for me.<br/>
Hokuto: (whispers) anything for you.<br/>
Taiga: hm?<br/>
Hokuto: nothing. Let's just go.</p><p>Hokuto thought Taiga didn't hear it. But he heard him clearly but he'll tease him next time.</p><p>-THE END-</p>
