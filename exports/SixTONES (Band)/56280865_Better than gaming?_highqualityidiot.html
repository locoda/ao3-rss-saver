<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Damn it!” Juri huffs as his character dies on the screen, and drops his Switch on the bed. He was <em>so close</em> this time; only two other players to be defeated and he would’ve won a round at last.</p><p>Juri rubs his face and ruffles his hair. Despite the frustration over losing, he somehow feels refreshed as well. And not at all sleepy, though it must be quite late already. His best unwinding method after concerts – playing Knives Out – still works wonders.</p><p>He’s just pondering whether to try one more round or switch to something lighter like the Suika Game, when he hears a weird rustle from somewhere. Juri turns his head and locates the noise to the door. First he thinks it’s their manager, but they must be asleep already and they’d anyway knock first.</p><p>Juri gets up from the bed, peering to the door when the noise just continues. He thinks he can also hear muffled mumbling through the door, and when he sees someone on the other side try the handle, he promptly marches to the door.</p><p>“Excuse me…?” Juri says as he cracks the door open. Whatever he’s expecting, it’s surely not Shintaro’s dumbfounded face on the other side. The face that brightens instantly as he realizes it’s Juri peering through the door.</p><p>“Oh! Juri!”</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Juri hisses to Shintaro.</p><p>“Sorry, I got the rooms mixed up. No wonder my card key didn’t work…” Shintaro waves the hotel room card in his hand and lets out a laugh.</p><p>He’s swaying slightly and his voice is even louder than usual so Juri guesses they’ve been drinking more with Jesse. They all went out for a meal after the concert but only Shintaro and Jesse wanted to continue the night at some other place. Juri can only admire their tolerance, his head still feels a bit fuzzy after the drinks at dinner.</p><p>“You weren’t sleeping yet, were you?” Shintaro asks.</p><p>“Not me, but all others on this corridor probably are. Lower your voice!”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Shintaro starts with a whisper but then his voice gradually grows louder again. “We just got back with Jesse. Guess where we went? Karaoke! And sang like a hundred songs!”</p><p>“Yeah? That’s great,” Juri muses and can’t help but smile when watching Shintaro’s tipsy and cheerful face. His good mood is contagious.</p><p>“C’mere,” he then says and pulls Shintaro into his room, closing the door after them to cut the noise pollution in the corridor. “So I take it you had fun, huh?”</p><p>“We did! You should’ve come too,” Shintaro says, nudging Juri’s shoulder playfully.</p><p>“Nah, I had a great time here,” Juri assures. “With Knives Out.”</p><p>Shintaro rolls his eyes at that. “You never come anywhere when I invite you anymore,” he says, his voice suddenly a bit sulky (jokingly or not, Juri cannot tell).</p><p>“I do!” Juri says immediately, though he knows it’s not entirely true. “Well, I intend to. Next time, I promise?”</p><p>Shintaro’s gaze is very skeptical. He even <em>pouts</em> a little. Damn it, Juri had forgotten his sly and flirty azatoi levels rise exponentially when he drinks.</p><p>“I just miss hanging out with you, is all,” Shintaro says. “Because I like you, you know.”</p><p>Juri knows what he means with that, or more like <em>how</em> he means it, but his stomach does a little embarrassing flip anyway. “I–I like you, too.”</p><p>He reaches out and touches Shintaro’s upper arm to emphasize his words. Then, he slides his hand down and takes Shintaro’s hand in his, squeezing it.</p><p>“Yeah?” Shintaro asks and tilts his head slightly, a small smile playing on his lips. Juri almost hates it because suddenly he’d like to do more than just hold hands.</p><p>“Of course,” he says with a laugh. He feels like they’re tiptoeing around something unsaid.</p><p>Shintaro looks content and languidly swings their joined hands back and forth. “I’m not tired at all yet. Mind if I stay here for a while?”</p><p>Ok, that’s a bit surprising.</p><p>Juri tilts his head in turn, as two can play the game they’re apparently playing right now. And it’s rare for Shintaro to be up for it, even jokingly.</p><p>“What if I say no? I’ve got a game to win.”</p><p>“Forget your games for once,” Shintaro huffs. He’s closer than before. Juri feels his pulse quicken and excitement bubbling in his gut.</p><p>He gives Shintaro a small grin and raises his brows as a dare. <em>Make me.</em></p><p>And Shintaro does just that.</p><p>He lets go of Juri’s hand, cupping his face instead and leaning in. He takes his time, and when Juri doesn’t pull away, Shintaro presses a tentative kiss on his lips. It’s quick, too quick, and Juri chases a new one right away. Eagerly, he opens his mouth against Shintaro’s, brushing their tongues together.</p><p>And however much Juri’s intended it all, he still feels a bit lightheaded and weak on the knees with the way Shintaro kisses him. He grabs Shintaro’s shirt as the younger pushes him up against the wall, deepening the kiss even more.</p><p>When they finally pull apart, they’re both panting slightly. Juri wraps his arms loosely around Shintaro’s neck.</p><p>“Okay, you may stay,” he declares. “But only if you keep this up.”</p><p>”What, this?” Shintaro grins and leans back in, kissing Juri again and <em>slowly</em>, teasingly running his tongue along Juri’s bottom lip. A moan escapes from the back of his throat, and Juri sucks Shintaro’s tongue into his mouth, kissing him long and good before continuing.</p><p>“Yeah, this. But also, I’m very turned on right now, so it wouldn’t hurt if you were up for something more than just kissing?”</p><p>Juri looks at Shintaro evenly, sinking his fingers into his nape hair, idly toying with the strands. Shintaro’s hands rest on his hips. It’s almost weird how <em>not weird</em> it feels to be this close with him, to kiss him and to even suggest something like that, though it makes Juri’s heart speed up all the same. But somehow he feels that now is the right moment, a rare and fleeting chance, and he’s ready to take it if Shintaro is.</p><p>And it seems like he is, judging from the way he’s smiling and looking at Juri.</p><p>“Alright,” he agrees.</p><p>“Yeah? Really?”</p><p>“Really!”</p><p>“Okay, great!”</p><p>Excited, Juri takes Shintaro’s hand and pulls him further into the room. He’s already wrapping his arms around Shintaro again, ready to continue where they left off, when he suddenly freezes, a thought crossing his mind. He puts a hand on Shintaro’s chest to halt him, too.</p><p>“Wait, this is just as friends and all, right?” he confirms.</p><p>“Yeah, obviously,” Shintaro agrees.</p><p>“And it won’t be awkward later…?”</p><p>Shintaro shrugs, pursing his lips. “No? If we don’t make it awkward?” When Juri stops and thinks about that for a moment or two too long, Shintaro continues: “And this is us. We know each other, we like each other and we’re doing this just for fun, right? Why would it be awkward?”</p><p>Juri looks at Shintaro, thankful for this rare matter-of-fact and logical thought about the matter. Who knew tipsy Shintaro could be so reasonable about this. Juri’s just thinking too much.</p><p>“Yeah, you’re right,” he says. “It won’t be.”</p><p>Shintaro smiles warmly at him and leans closer, nuzzling along Juri’s cheek. “Now that we’re on the same page… Can we continue?”</p><p>“Hell yeah.”</p><p>Juri presses himself against Shintaro again and kisses him with new fervor. He feels Shintaro’s hands slipping under his shirt, trailing along his back and sides, leaving goosebumps in their wake.</p><p>Juri craves for more, wants Shintaro’s hands all over himself, so he steps back a bit and pulls his shirt over his head. He gestures for Shintaro to follow suit, and as soon as the other does, Juri pulls him closer again. He runs his hands up Shintaro’s arms, feeling up the muscles as he goes. The biceps under Juri’s fingers flex as Shintaro yanks him flush against himself by the hips. He holds on, their crotches rubbing together, making both of them moan.</p><p>The friction sends a shiver through Juri. He feels anxious, impatient, half-hard already.</p><p>“I want you to fuck me,” he mumbles against Shintaro’s mouth. “Is that okay?”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Shintaro manages between the kisses. “You… got any condoms and stuff for that?”</p><p>“I think so… Wait a sec,” Juri says and hurries for his suitcase that’s laying open at the foot of the bed. He goes through the zip pockets and does manage to find a condom from one of them. He also fishes a small tube of lube from his toilet bag, throwing both on the bed. He grins victoriously at Shintaro who looks impressed.</p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>“Always be prepared!” Juri declares and walks back into Shintaro's arms, kissing him.</p><p>“I hope you <em>are</em> prepared for this,” Shintaro says playfully, pulling Juri along to the bed. He sits down on the edge, looking up at Juri, eyes dark and expectant.</p><p>Juri swiftly pulls down his sweats and kicks them off before stepping between Shintaro’s thighs. He rests his arms on Shintaro’s shoulders while Shintaro’s hands slowly travel up his thighs to his hips and waist. Juri sinks his fingers into Shintaro’s hair when the younger leans in to trail kisses across his stomach and chest. He stops and flicks his tongue over Juri’s left nipple, sucking on it lightly, making Juri pant.</p><p>His pants turn more ragged and he has to bite down on his lip when Shintaro suddenly cups him through the underwear and starts stroking him, slowly and firmly. Juri is already hard and he automatically thrusts his hips into the touch, craving more.</p><p>“Wait,” Juri mutters, halting Shintaro momentarily to take off his underwear and freeing his erection. He yanks at Shintaro’s pants, too.</p><p>“These, off. Now!”</p><p>Shintaro snorts but complys promptly, and Juri helps him pull down both the pants and the boxers. Once they’re both finally naked, Juri climbs on the bed, straddling Shintaro. He grabs Shintaro’s shoulder for support, his breaths coming out in erratic pants and moans as their dicks rub together.</p><p>Juri moves his shaky hand between them, wrapping his fingers around both of their lengths and pumping up and down rhythmically. A wave of pleasure spreads through Juri while Shintaro butts his head against Juri’s shoulder with a low groan.</p><p>“Ah, fuck–Juri…”</p><p>“Don’t come yet,” Juri warns him. “I still want you to fuck me.”</p><p>“Then let’s get on with that!” Shintaro raises his head to look at him. “Change of position?”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Juri yelps when Shintaro grabs him under the arms and hoists out of his lap, pushing him on his back on the bed. Shintaro crawls after him, snatching the lube and the condom in his hand on the way. Juri pulls himself to the head of the bed, moving aside his Switch that he left laying on the mattress. His phone is there, too. He holds both up to Shintaro.</p><p>“Can you put these on the bedside table? And then get back here.”</p><p>Shintaro does as told, and once the devices are out of the way, he moves back to Juri. Juri spreads his legs and Shintaro settles between them, leaning down over Juri to kiss him.</p><p>“I’m ready,” Juri tells him. “And I won’t need much prepping.”</p><p>Shintaro nods and sits back up. He opens the lube and spreads some on his fingers. Juri watches him and bends his legs, lifting them up a bit. Soon, he feels Shintaro’s finger at his hole and instructs the younger to go with two fingers right away. He closes his eyes, trying to relax as Shintaro pushes in and starts moving his fingers back and forth carefully.</p><p>“You alright?” Shintaro confirms, voice gentle, and Juri nods.</p><p>“Yeah, go on.”</p><p>Shintaro soon adds a third finger, carefully scissoring them inside Juri, and his fingers brush his wall at the right spot, making Juri gasp.</p><p>“That spot,” he pants, “do that again.”</p><p>“This?” Shintaro tries to mimic the movement, pressing gently with his fingers, and Juri’s back arches at the sensation.</p><p>“Ahh, yes! Right there.” Warmth spreads through him with each press of Shintaro’s fingers, making his toes curl.</p><p>“You wanna come like this?” Shintaro asks while watching him, but Juri shakes his head.</p><p>“No, I–I want you inside me,” he breathes. “Now.”</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Shintaro chuckles and pulls his fingers out.</p><p>Juri hears him ripping open the condom pack and rises up on his elbows to look at the other. Shintaro is on his knees in front of him, rolling the condom on his cock and adding more lube. After he’s done, he raises his gaze and locks eyes with Juri. His hair is all tousled, sweat glistening on his brow, lips red from all the kissing and Juri <em>wants</em> him desperately.</p><p>“Come on,” Juri says, voice all tight and holds out his hand. Shintaro leans back over Juri, lowering his hips while Juri guides him in with his hand. Juri hooks his heels behind Shintaro’s thighs as Shintaro pushes in all the way, slowly. Juri can’t help a moan as he finally fills him. He grabs Shintaro by the back of the neck and pulls him down for a kiss that turns quite sloppy soon when Shintaro starts thrusting into him.</p><p>For a moment it’s just their bodies moving together, incomprehensible pants and moans that mingle, open-mouthed kisses.</p><p>Juri grips on Shintaro’s shoulder and slides his other hand in between them, fisting his own dick. He starts pumping it in sync with Shintaro’s thrusts. The pace is quick and Juri knows he won’t last long anymore.</p><p>”I’m close,” Shintaro pants after a couple more pushes.</p><p>”A bit more,” Juri breathes. He, too, feels his climax approaching, his cock leaking already on his stomach. He picks up speed as Shintaro pounds into him, both of them chasing their orgasms.</p><p>Juri bites his lip, arches his back and squeezes at the base of his cock, letting out a low moan as he finally spills on his stomach.</p><p>Riding his high, Juri grabs Shintaro by the neck again, grazing his teeth along the skin there, nibbling lightly. Then, he suddenly clenches his muscles around Shintaro’s cock and feels Shintaro coming too, grunting deeply, dropping his head on Juri’s shoulder.</p><p>After catching his breath for a moment or two, Shintaro pulls out and drops on his side next to Juri with a huff. Juri turns towards him, his fingers finding their way into Shintaro’s hair again.</p><p>”That was good,” Juri says, smiling. ”<em>Almost</em> as good a way to relax as playing Knives Out.”</p><p>Shintaro snorts and rolls his eyes, but his smile and gaze are soft as he looks at Juri. He then inches closer again and kisses Juri slowly, lazily, and Juri all but melts against him. Juri feels light and languid, and he could probably stay right there forever if it wasn’t for the messy and sticky feeling.</p><p>They pull apart eventually, and Juri watches Shintaro sit up and pull off the condom. He gets up from the bed, throwing the used condom into the trash can.</p><p>”Don’t go just yet,” Juri calls from the bed, still watching Shintaro. ”Shower with me?”</p><p>Shintaro raises a brow at him. ”As friends still?”</p><p>”Of course! With possible kissing and groping?”</p><p>”Sure.”</p>
