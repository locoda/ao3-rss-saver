    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Taiga was lying in a hospital bed looking miserable as ever. He is suffering from acute heart failure and is awaiting a heart transplant but he has lost all motivation to do anything. It was lunch time and he didn’t touch his lunch no matter what the nurses did. Jesse the nurse on call went over to the desk where a new nurse Aya was doing some paperwork. “Would you go into Kyomoto Taiga in room 666 at dinner. He’s refusing to eat and he needs to keep his strength up in case he gets a new heart”. Aya nodded a bit nervous as she had heard alot about Taiga and his stubborness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Aya walked into the room with his plate of dinner and placed it beside his bed. "Mr Kyomoto your dinner is here". Taiga looked up and saw the most prettiest girl ever but his stubborn nature took over. "Leave me alone I don't want it" He said his voice muffled as he turned over on his side. Aya sat next to him determined to try do what no other nurse has managed to do. "look would you take two or three spoonfuls of food? I promise I'll leave you alone then. You need to get your strength up in case you get called in for your heart transplant surgery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga turned around again and snapped." I've been waiting six god damn months for a new heart and I'm getting sicker and sicker. It would just be better to let me die" before starting to wheeze and Aya quickly went over and put his oxygen mask on before gently rubbing his back, sitting on the edge of his bed. When Taiga eventually stopped wheezing he took off the mask and whispered. "I want to keep on hoping that I'll get a new heart but I've been stuck here months and every day that passes I lose more and more hope." Aya rubbed his shoulders in comfort. Mr Kyomoto you should never give up hoping. You'll never know what's going to happen." Taiga smiled at her "You can call me Taiga and thank you" He tried reaching for his food but his hand was so weak so Aya picked up his spoon and spoon fed him and Taiga would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy it. When he was done he yawned tired and Aya got up and pushed his hair back. "I'll come check on you later" Taiga nodded and Aya pulled the blankets around him before leaving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse smiled when she came out having seen some of what went on and grinned. "what did you say to him becuase he's never voluntarily eaten for anyone". Aya blushed and "I just gave him a few words of courage that's all". Jesse laughed and soon after Aya's shift ended he said to his fellow nurse Shintaro. "I wonder how long it will take for them to get together". Shintaro laughed. “I bet you 5000 yen they will get together by the end of month”. Jesse grinned “You’re on”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the days went on Aya was put in charge of looking after Taiga and making sure he was eating Taiga always enjoyed her visits and they grew closer together. Aya went as far as to even visit him during her days off, something that made Taiga have the will to keep on going. They were watching a movie on Aya’s day off  and Taiga’s doctor, Dr Hokuto Matsumura came in with a smile.” Mind if you leave Aya I need to talk to Mr Kyomoto privately” Aya nodded and started to leave when Taiga grabbed her arm. “I want her to stay Dr. Matsumura” Hokuto nodded “Very well then. Good news Mr Kyomoto you have received a new heart and we will be prepping you for surgery in half an hour. I’ll leave you and Aya alone to talk.” When he left Taiga suddenly burst into tears. Aya looked confused but went down to hug him “What’s wrong” She said soothingly rubbing his back “I thought this is what you wanted?” Taiga nodded “I know and I’m happy but I’m so scared. What if I don’t survive” Aya tilted his head up “You will survive. You’re the strongest person I know and I’ll be here by your side” Taiga felt butterflies in his stomach at her words and smiled. “Do you really mean that”. Aya smiled and  nodded. “Yes I really do, I…….love you so much” and kissed him on the cheek gently. Taiga smiled “I feel the same way” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Aya smiled and squeezed his hand. “I’ll be here when you wake up” and the other nurses came back to prep him for surgery and she walked out and looked back and smiled.Jesse noticed her smiling and asked “did you and him get together then” Aya nodded going red. Jesse grinned at Shintaro knowing he just won 5000 yen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the hours passed Aya became increasingly worried until Dr.Matsumura came out with a smile on his face. Aya stood up and he answered the question that she was wondering. “He’s doing fine Aya. The surgery went well and he’s in recovery. You can go and see him now” Aya smiled and went inside where he was lying. He turned his head slightly and Aya could see a faint smile on his face. She went over to him and put a hand around his shoulder that wasn’t full of iv lines “Dr Matsumura said the surgery went well and there’s no sign of rejection” she said fondly. Taiga looked at her with a smile and thought how lucky he was to have his new heart and a new lover.  </span>
