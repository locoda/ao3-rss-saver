  <p>The way he stumbled into <em>Magnolia Flower Café </em>was by chance. His boss is looking for a location to shoot the magazine cover for next month’s model, and he wanted someplace outside the studio. Fire razed their original location, and the shoot is supposed to be in three days. Juri is working double time enough as it is.</p><p>Just as he was about to pass the café, he stops and looks at the flowers surrounding the off-white wooden walls. Thew place is almost empty, except for a man typing on his laptop and a woman sipping coffee at another table.</p><p>Juri reaches for the door handle and makes his way in. The place actually doesn’t look bad. The flowers make it aesthetic enough and matches the concept they have for the photoshoot. He takes out his phone and opens the camera app so he can take pictures to send to his boss.</p><p>“Hi, can I help you?”</p><p>Juri turns around and finds himself face to face with wavy-haired man and a bright smile. He’s wearing a white shirt and a brown apron that go well with the café’s aesthetic. And he has a name tag on.</p><p>“Hi, um …” He squints at the name tag. “Kochi.” He puts on his most professional smile before reaching for his wallet to take out his business card. “I’m Tanaka Juri. From <em>Style Tokyo</em>.”</p><p>Kochi blinks as he takes the business card. “Oh, hi,” he greets. He takes out a business card from the pocket of his apron. “I’m Kochi Yugo. I’m the manager of Magnolia.”</p><p>“I’m actually scouting locations for a photoshoot,” Juri explains. “It’s kind of last-minute because our original location had a problem, and I was wondering if we could do it here.”</p><p>Kochi’s smile widens. “That would be nice,” he remarks. “When will you have it?”</p><p>“In three days.” Juri grimaces. “"It’ll just be for half a day, and you can get back to your normal operations after that. We’ll cover food, drinks, and flowers —”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Well, that was easy. “Okay?” he repeats, just to be sure.</p><p>“Yeah, we’re usually not busy on …” He fishes out his phone and taps his fingers on the screen. “Thursdays, so we can accommodate a photoshoot. Does morning sound good to you?”</p><p>“Of course.” Juri grins as he fishes out his phone to give his boss the head’s up. “Thank you so much.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The photoshoot went better than expected. As always, Juri gets lost in the flurry of activity, from setting up the location to directing his assistants. Kochi Yugo makes sure they have everything they need, even helping some of their assistants arrange the flowers.</p><p>And the food and drinks were good, too. Juri’s no gourmet, but he would come back to Magnolia just for that iced Americano and cheesecake.</p><p>When everyone is packed up and ready to leave, he approaches Yugo, who had returned to the counter to punch something in the cash register. He looks up and puts on his customer-friendly smile. “Can I help you?”</p><p>“Just wanna thank you for today,” Juri says, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>Yugo shakes his head. “Glad to be of help,” he remarks.</p><p>“Anything I can do to thank you?”</p><p>“Oh, just promote this place in your magazine, and I should be fine.” Yugo chuckles. “Or you can swing by over here without bringing your work.”</p><p>Juri laughs at that. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Juri keeps his word and goes back to Magnolia two weeks later. Because his friends are busy with their own personal lives, he had nothing else to do on a Saturday morning.</p><p>Not that Juri is jealous. He hasn't been with anyone in a while, and it’s refreshing. No need to wait for someone or find something to talk about. No need to read the room to see if his date is having a great time or feeling bored.</p><p>It’s just him.</p><p>Yugo isn’t there when he enters. Instead, it’s Matsumura Hokuto — Yugo introduced him as the chef — who approaches him. “Hello,” he greets, eyes brightening. “Tanaka, right? From the magazine shoot a few days ago.”</p><p>Juri blinks but nods. “Yeah, that’s me. How did you …”</p><p>“Oh, Yugo told me about it. Might have dug a bit into your magazine, too.” Hokuto grins. “Actually, we have to thank you. A lot of our new customers saw the café in your magazine, so we owe you a lot.”</p><p>Warmth spreads across his chest. “Good to know.”</p><p>“Yugo’s out for some errands, but he’ll be back.” Hokuto gestures to the dining area, where the place is surprisingly almost full. “Have a seat, and I’ll get the menu. He said your first meal with us is on the house.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo returns to the café thirty minutes later, just as Juri is enjoying his meal. He beams and practically skips toward him. “Hey, you came.”</p><p>Juri grins. “Hey. Thanks for the free meal. You really didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“Oh, I wanted to.” Yugo plops on the chair across him. “Since your magazine came out, customers came pouring in. We have a lot more people in the café, and we have a lot of flower deliveries, too.”</p><p>“Flower deliveries?” Juri repeats.</p><p>“Yeah, would be a waste if these flowers are just for display here.” He tilts his head toward the doorframe bordered with flowers. “But this café actually started as a flower shop, until I convinced my parents that the flowers need to have some use instead of us waiting for a customer to turn it into a bouquet.”</p><p>Juri nods. “So, a family business.”</p><p>“Yup. One that I would never trade in the world for.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes sparkle as he talks about the café and the flower shop, a sparkle Juri understands. He has the same passion when he’s looking for locations for their shoot, when he’s taking photos of things and places and people. He loves the rush he gets whenever he nails a photo, whether intentionally or not. And best of all, he loves it when people feel something from his work.</p><p>But he likes this passion on Yugo, one that he wishes he could see every day.</p>

  <p>Unlike the warm, spring-like interiors of the cafe, the city outside is transformed with a blanket of snow, with delicate flakes falling gently onto the ground. The air outside is crisp and cold, and Juri thanks the heavens that Magnolia’s heater is working double time.</p><p>It’s already evening, just hours after the dinner rush, and yet the place is almost full. Juri — he’s lucky to be working remotely today — ignores the thousands of photos he should be sorting through to watch Yugo take orders while giving instructions to the new waiter — Shintaro. Sometimes Shintaro would take over so that Yugo would disappear in the flower booth to handle deliveries that come and go.</p><p>“You’re staring.”</p><p>Juri glares at his companion, who has been watching him with a hand on his chin and a knowing smile. “I’m just amazed how he could handle everything when the cafe is busy.”</p><p>“Oh, Juri.” Taiga laughs. “I think I’ve known you long enough to recognize if you like someone.”</p><p>He clears his throat. <em>Of course</em>. Of all people, Taiga should know.</p><p>“And you’re not exactly the type who likes” — Taiga makes a sweeping gesture at the walls — “this kind of aesthetic, so I figured out your Saturdays are occupied not because you like flowers.”</p><p>“Okay, detective genius, that’s enough,” Juri mumbles, rolling his eyes and returning his attention to his laptop.</p><p>Taiga laughs before his gaze softens. “But seriously, I’m happy for you,” he says. “I haven’t seen you like this since …” He trails off when Juri raises an eyebrow at him then stays silent.</p><p>Juri would rather not have Taiga continue the sentence. They were doing so well being who they are now. If they try to remember again …</p><p>“Anyway.” Taiga looks at his watch then stands up. “I should get going.”</p><p>Juri grunts in reply. From his gaze at the laptop, he fees Taiga put down a couple of bills before standing up.</p><p>He doesn’t know how long Taiga has gone, but someone has sat where he used to sit. When Juri looks up, he’s met by a bright smile. “Hey,” Yugo greets with a smile.</p><p>Juri grins, closing his laptop. “Does being manager involve sitting with customers?” he asks.</p><p>“Helps with the customer service,” Yugo quips. “Also, it’s almost closing time.” He slides Juri’s bill next to his phone.</p><p>He looks at his watch, and sure enough, it’s almost nine. “Sorry about that.” He takes out his wallet.</p><p>“No need to rush. Just leave it by the register. I just need to store the flowers, alright?”</p><p>Juri finds an exact amount and packs up before heading to the register, where Shintaro punches in his order. From there, he can see Yugo and Hokuto in the booth across them, wrapping flowers in their vases before disappearing in a white door that Juri has never seen before.</p><p>He can’t help but approach the booth. “Where do the flowers go?” he asks.</p><p>Yugo turns around. “Oh, to our cold storage,” he says, gesturing toward the door. “It’s where we keep them from wilting.”</p><p>“Amazing.”</p><p>“Would you like to check it out?” Yugo offers with a chuckle.</p><p>Juri’s not in a hurry. He’ll just be by himself in his apartment, most of his boxes still unopened. He’s not looking forward to unpacking those either. He shrugs and nods.</p><p>He’s expecting harsh, industrial lights, but the cold storage just like those shelves from the drinks section of a convenience store, only vases of flowers surround it. Juri watches as Yugo opens one of the refrigerator doors before storing the vase he’s holding inside.</p><p>“Do you really like flowers?” Juri asks.</p><p>Yugo laughs. “I mean, I <em>do</em> run a cafe-slash-flower shop.”</p><p>“I know that.” Juri mentally smacks his face. “It’s just —“</p><p>“I get it.” Yugo heads out of the storage, and Juri follows. “But I really do <em>love</em> flowers. Sometimes they express feelings better than words ever could.”</p><p>Juri vaguely knows that flowers do carry some symbolisms — like roses are for eternal love or whatever. But just as he’s about to ask Yugo to elaborate, Shintaro and Hokuto call Yugo’s name.</p><p>“Yo, Jesse’s here.”</p><p>He had seen Yugo’s face brighten before, but right now, his face puts the sun to shame. “I have to go,” he says. “See you again, Tanaka?”</p><p>“Yeah. See you.”</p><p>As he exits so that Shintaro and Hokuto could lock up, he watches Yugo practically run toward a tall figure by the lamp post. The man’s face — Jesse, from what Juri remembers a couple of seconds ago — brightens up as well as he opens his arms, welcoming Yugo in an embrace.</p><p>“He’s Jesse,” Shintaro says. Juri didn’t even know that Yugo’s two co-workers have already finished locking up.</p><p>“Jesse?” Juri repeats.</p><p>“Yugo’s boyfriend,” Hokuto adds before slinging his bag over his shoulder.</p><p>Juri’s supposed to turn the other way around and walk home. But he can’t take his eyes away from Yugo and Jesse.</p><p>Neither can he ignore the hot pit in his stomach when he watches Jesse kiss the top of Yugo’s head before they walk away, hand in hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Jesse. Two years younger than Yugo, a year younger than Juri. Just graduated and is currently looking for a job.</p><p>They met when Yugo was in his third year of university, and Jesse in his first. Jesse had been adamant in getting Yugo to date him, and at first, Yugo wasn’t interested in being in a relationship. But apparently, Jesse is hard to say no to.</p><p>And Yugo hadn’t been saying no to Jesse for the next three years.</p><p>Juri learns everything about Yugo and Jesse against his will. Unfortunately, he came at a slow day at Magnolia, and Yugo was out speaking to one of their flower suppliers. Shintaro takes it as an opportunity to blab away even though Juri only asked about how long Yugo and Jesse have been together.</p><p>Shintaro seems to be willing to share more until Yugo finally arrives, arms crossed. Not that it scared Shintaro, who skips back to the register.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that.” Yugo smiles apologetically as he sits across Juri, like he always does. “I can’t believe I tell that brat <em>everything</em>.”</p><p>Juri swallows the last of his drink. “I think he’s just happy for you,” he says. “<em>You</em> seem to be happy.”</p><p>“Not all the time.” Yugo blushes. “But Jesse’s worth staying for.”</p><p>A couple of years ago, Juri believed that, too. He’s glad that Taiga’s still in his life at all, but he wonders if he could have been worth staying or he was just a coward to let go.</p><p>But it’s all in the past. They’re still friends — maybe not as close as they were before — and Juri has moved on. To one of the brightest smiles he has ever seen. But whose smile will not be for him.</p>
