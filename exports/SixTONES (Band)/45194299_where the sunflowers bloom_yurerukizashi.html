      <p>The way he stumbled into <em>Magnolia Flower Café </em>was by chance. His boss is looking for a location to shoot the magazine cover for next month’s model, and he wanted someplace outside the studio. Fire razed their original location, and the shoot is supposed to be in three days. Juri is working double time enough as it is.</p><p>Just as he was about to pass the café, he stops and looks at the flowers surrounding the off-white wooden walls. Thew place is almost empty, except for a man typing on his laptop and a woman sipping coffee at another table.</p><p>Juri reaches for the door handle and makes his way in. The place actually doesn’t look bad. The flowers make it aesthetic enough and matches the concept they have for the photoshoot. He takes out his phone and opens the camera app so he can take pictures to send to his boss.</p><p>“Hi, can I help you?”</p><p>Juri turns around and finds himself face to face with wavy-haired man and a bright smile. He’s wearing a white shirt and a brown apron that go well with the café’s aesthetic. And he has a name tag on.</p><p>“Hi, um …” He squints at the name tag. “Kochi.” He puts on his most professional smile before reaching for his wallet to take out his business card. “I’m Tanaka Juri. From <em>Style Tokyo</em>.”</p><p>Kochi blinks as he takes the business card. “Oh, hi,” he greets. He takes out a business card from the pocket of his apron. “I’m Kochi Yugo. I’m the manager of Magnolia.”</p><p>“I’m actually scouting locations for a photoshoot,” Juri explains. “It’s kind of last-minute because our original location had a problem, and I was wondering if we could do it here.”</p><p>Kochi’s smile widens. “That would be nice,” he remarks. “When will you have it?”</p><p>“In three days.” Juri grimaces. “"It’ll just be for half a day, and you can get back to your normal operations after that. We’ll cover food, drinks, and flowers —”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Well, that was easy. “Okay?” he repeats, just to be sure.</p><p>“Yeah, we’re usually not busy on …” He fishes out his phone and taps his fingers on the screen. “Thursdays, so we can accommodate a photoshoot. Does morning sound good to you?”</p><p>“Of course.” Juri grins as he fishes out his phone to give his boss the head’s up. “Thank you so much.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The photoshoot went better than expected. As always, Juri gets lost in the flurry of activity, from setting up the location to directing his assistants. Kochi Yugo makes sure they have everything they need, even helping some of their assistants arrange the flowers.</p><p>And the food and drinks were good, too. Juri’s no gourmet, but he would come back to Magnolia just for that iced Americano and cheesecake.</p><p>When everyone is packed up and ready to leave, he approaches Yugo, who had returned to the counter to punch something in the cash register. He looks up and puts on his customer-friendly smile. “Can I help you?”</p><p>“Just wanna thank you for today,” Juri says, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>Yugo shakes his head. “Glad to be of help,” he remarks.</p><p>“Anything I can do to thank you?”</p><p>“Oh, just promote this place in your magazine, and I should be fine.” Yugo chuckles. “Or you can swing by over here without bringing your work.”</p><p>Juri laughs at that. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Juri keeps his word and goes back to Magnolia two weeks later. Because his friends are busy with their own personal lives, he had nothing else to do on a Saturday morning.</p><p>Not that Juri is jealous. He hasn't been with anyone in a while, and it’s refreshing. No need to wait for someone or find something to talk about. No need to read the room to see if his date is having a great time or feeling bored.</p><p>It’s just him.</p><p>Yugo isn’t there when he enters. Instead, it’s Matsumura Hokuto — Yugo introduced him as the chef — who approaches him. “Hello,” he greets, eyes brightening. “Tanaka, right? From the magazine shoot a few days ago.”</p><p>Juri blinks but nods. “Yeah, that’s me. How did you …”</p><p>“Oh, Yugo told me about it. Might have dug a bit into your magazine, too.” Hokuto grins. “Actually, we have to thank you. A lot of our new customers saw the café in your magazine, so we owe you a lot.”</p><p>Warmth spreads across his chest. “Good to know.”</p><p>“Yugo’s out for some errands, but he’ll be back.” Hokuto gestures to the dining area, where the place is surprisingly almost full. “Have a seat, and I’ll get the menu. He said your first meal with us is on the house.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yugo returns to the café thirty minutes later, just as Juri is enjoying his meal. He beams and practically skips toward him. “Hey, you came.”</p><p>Juri grins. “Hey. Thanks for the free meal. You really didn’t have to do that.”</p><p>“Oh, I wanted to.” Yugo plops on the chair across him. “Since your magazine came out, customers came pouring in. We have a lot more people in the café, and we have a lot of flower deliveries, too.”</p><p>“Flower deliveries?” Juri repeats.</p><p>“Yeah, would be a waste if these flowers are just for display here.” He tilts his head toward the doorframe bordered with flowers. “But this café actually started as a flower shop, until I convinced my parents that the flowers need to have some use instead of us waiting for a customer to turn it into a bouquet.”</p><p>Juri nods. “So, a family business.”</p><p>“Yup. One that I would never trade in the world for.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes sparkle as he talks about the café and the flower shop, a sparkle Juri understands. He has the same passion when he’s looking for locations for their shoot, when he’s taking photos of things and places and people. He loves the rush he gets whenever he nails a photo, whether intentionally or not. And best of all, he loves it when people feel something from his work.</p><p>But he likes this passion on Yugo, one that he wishes he could see every day.</p>
