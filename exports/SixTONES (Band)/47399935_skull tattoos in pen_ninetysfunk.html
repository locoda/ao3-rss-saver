    <h2 class="toc-heading">skull tattoos in pen</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Taiga feels his throat start to close up as his ears ring, beads of sweat dripping down his temples as his mouth salivates unstoppably. He looks at the light on his phone and checks the time, </span>
  <em>
    <span>12:01am. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He didn’t know what to do, his mind was racing with sheer hunger. He throws his covers off him, fangs jutting out past his top lip, the hunger was so mind numbingly painful he swore he caught himself crying a few times.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bedroom door opens, the light peaking through and Taiga’s eyes softened when he saw his husband standing in the door frame, reading glasses sliding slowly down his nose, ridiculous bunny slippers on with his usual sleep wear, “I heard some noises from the study and got worried,” Bless Hokuto’s heart, he always was a sweet person and Taiga couldn’t have thanked him enough for it— but, Hokuto’s scent was filling up all of Taiga’s senses he swears he started seeing stars for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto walks over to the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight as he sits next to Taiga, hand reaching out to his husband when he flinches at how cold he is. Right, how could he forget? His lover got in some freak accident and came back a week later as a being Hokuto swore only existed in fairytales but, guess this fairytale just bit him in the ass, “How are you feeling? Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga shakes his head immediately— no point in hiding it, Taiga looked like he was seconds away from losing his mind, anyway, “I think I’m going crazy,” Taiga says bluntly, pinching his skin to redirect his racing mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger sighs, rubbing his thumb over Taiga’s knuckles and bit his lip as he thought about what could possibly be going on— even though he already knew what it was. He sighs shakily and nods, “It’s your feeding cycle, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, Hokuto, hell, I don’t even know who did this to me,” Taiga weeps as he falls against the pillows on their shared bed, brown hair stuck to his forehead from the sweat as his breathing grew heavy, “I just want it to stop, I want it to stop…” He whispered to himself so softly that Hokuto could only barely hear it, but it still broke his heart anyway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Drink my blood,” Hokuto blurts out, catching both of them off guard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck no!” Taiga exclaims, shaking his head, “I’m not doing that to you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, please? You look like you’re on the verge of death, Taiga,” Hokuto asks desperately, gripping onto Taiga’s cold hands, “Please?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to hurt you,” Taiga shakes his head again, ripping his hand away as he places the pillow over his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You won’t be hurting me, I swear,” The younger said firmly this time, holding onto Taiga’s hand and squeezing, “I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga sighs, leaning onto his back while thinking. It certainly wasn’t a bad idea, Hokuto smelled sweet, delectable almost, but he drowned those thoughts out with just drinking coffee to satiate his hunger. But this was beyond bad, this was down right awful, and honestly, Taiga wants to decline his offer so badly but Hokuto’s skin felt so nice, he smelled so good and– Oh, god… Taiga has to feed on Hokuto.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He moves the pillow away and looks down at the hand Hokuto used to hold his, “Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto swore he almost passed out after hearing Taiga’s voice after what seemed like an eternity. He nods earnestly, moving his hand up to his lover’s arm and placing a kiss on it, “I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga sighs, sitting up and staring down at his palms, a little afraid and a little glad he’d finally be rid of this hunger, but mostly fear that he may hurt Hokuto and the last thing he ever wants to do is hurt the man who loves him so much. He places his hand on one side of Hokuto’s neck, bringing his face close to his flesh before Taiga looks up one last time, “You’re really sure?” He asks again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto’s breath hitches in his throat and he nods, wanting nothing more than to just make this easier for his husband, human or not, Hokuto would have severed a limb for Taiga, but he’d never tell him that, of course, “I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga nods, taking that as final confirmation before he sinks his sharp canines into Hokuto’s neck, blood already spurting out of the puncture wounds. The older felt the way the warmth of his blood poured into his mouth, the scent, so strong and so overwhelming, he doesn’t realise the small moan that slips out of his mouth. The vibration sending shivers down Hokuto’s spine as he grips the older’s hair, “F-fuck, Taiga…” Hokuto whispers breathlessly, the pain of the bite coursing through his veins but it was also strangely… Arousing?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga pushes his face closer, his nose pressed against the soft flesh of his neck, getting his complete fill as his hunger begins to become more and more fulfilled but he wanted more, he wanted to taste Hokuto more, he wanted to savour his taste, make it the only thing his mouth can taste. He removed his teeth, causing Hokuto to let out a shaky sigh. Taiga laps at his wounds like a desperate dog, wanting every last drop of Hokuto on his tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a sight for sore eyes, seeing Taiga like this, Hokuto wasn’t really sure if this was the same man he got married to 7 years ago, but he sure as hell knew his heart was swirling with love for him as he stroke his hair gently while Taiga sniffs his neck closely, letting out satisfied sighs as he pulls away. Taiga moves down to his arms, brushing his nose past Hokuto’s soft skin, breathing him in like he was oxygen, “One more time, please?” Taiga babbled out, tongue licking at Hokuto’s bare skin, blood getting all over his arm as Taiga peppered bloody kisses all over his wrist, “Please, Hokuto?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How could he say no when Taiga looked at him like that? He feels his cheeks heat up and he nods, “Just don’t go crazy… I’m still a human after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga shakes his head with a smile, “I would never hurt you, I promise,” Even with blood drenching his mouth and chin, that same sweet smile makes Hokuto’s heart thump, the blush on his cheeks growing more evident with the second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga pierces his teeth into Hokuto’s flesh once more, the latter winces in pain and Taiga is quick to reach up his hand to caress his face, thumb brushing past his cheekbones to soothe him and Hokuto actually begins to calm down. His breathing still shaky, but his heart at ease, watching as Taiga fed on the blood from his wrist, sighing a bit, reaching out his hand to lace his fingers through his strands, combing through it as Taiga continued eating desperately. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto didn’t know how to deal with change, especially something like this, but it was Taiga, he didn’t mind it much, even if it meant allowing him to suck out his life force once a month, but maybe that was an exaggeration. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Taiga was done, he pulls his mouth away, lips covered with his lover’s blood and his drool, dripping down to his chin before he wipes his mouth with his sweater sleeve, “Thank you, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger sighs when Taiga finishes, sighing to himself before shaking his head, “It’s no problem, but, could you grab the first aid kit in the drawer there? I don’t want to die from blood loss,” Hokuto jokes and the older immediately grabs it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He carefully tends to Hokuto’s wounds, almost like he was a doll that could break at any moment and Hokuto mentally thanks him for his tenderness. Taiga places a final bandage on his lover’s arm and smiles, closing the box, “All done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto smiles to himself, finger grazing over the gauze on his arm and neck and looks up at Taiga with so much warmth in his eyes, “Do you feel better now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do, thank you… I’ll find a way to deal with it next month, I promise,” Taiga smiles back, but apologetically in contrast to Hokuto’s gentle one, “I don’t want to do this to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Hokuto’s quick to reach his hand out to hold Tauga’s, “No, it’s okay. It gives me peace of mind if it’s me, so please, don’t feel bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga’s eyes well up again, guilt washing over him again as he leans in against Hokuto’s chest, “I’m sorry about this, I never wanted for any of this to turn out this way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All Hokuto can do is hold him, wrapping his arms around the older’s shoulders and placing a kiss to the crown of his head, “It’s okay, it’s not your fault,” And it really wasn’t, no one could have predicted this would happen. Sure, it was hard for Hokuto to adjust his body clock and schedule to Taiga’s need, but he loved him, and there really wasn’t anything he wouldn’t have done for him, “I’ll be with you no matter what.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga practically melts into his lover’s arms, so warm, so comfortable, he could get lost here forever. He places a gentle kiss to the center of Hokuto’s chest, fangs gently brushing against his skin on accident and he sighs, “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto tightens his embrace around Taiga and smiles, “I love you more.”</span>
