      <p>When the line between dreams and reality was too vague, one becomes trapped in a nightmare. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis was an exception. He was always strong enough to tell what was real or not, and he could easily break free from a nightmare. He wasn’t the brightest magician, but his gut and instincts rarely ever failed him. Most of the time, when another force dared to enter his dreams to trick him, they returned to reality with broken bones here and there. </p><p> </p><p>Thus he was surprised when someone dear appeared to him one night. That person was Matsumura Hokuto, the most powerful magician of the East. He was as beautiful as the day he last saw him two years ago, donning his black robe that glowed purple with the irises delicately embroidered with magic. Despite the centuries they spent linked together, he never failed to take Jesse’s breath away. Jesse never got tired of falling in love with him like the first time every chance they met. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokuto appeared in the dark void of his dreams glowing with a weak light. That itself bothered Jesse. He watched in wonder as Hokuto floated before him, his long robe billowing behind like he was weightless. Jesse reached out to touch Hokuto’s cheek, but his hand went through like he was an illusion. For once, Jesse wished this wasn’t just a dream. </p><p> </p><p>“When was the last time you appeared in my dreams, dear?”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse chuckled at the figure, giving up on trying to touch him since it was futile. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto merely smiled, and Jesse doesn’t miss the exhaustion in his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“What is it that the great Matsumura Hokuto needs that he has to enter my dreams to communicate with me?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘I need your help.’  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse was slightly taken aback, but he doesn’t let it show. It was a straightforward request. Hokuto never asked for anybody’s help. </p><p> </p><p>The apparition draws closer to cup Jesse’s cheek this time, and Jesse flinches. He shivers, not knowing how he can feel Hokuto’s hand when he couldn’t do so himself. He knew well enough that they were not ordinary people and of the earth’s realms, but the ghostliness of Hokuto’s touch and appearance did not sit well with Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘The dark forces growing in Tokyo… I cannot hold them back any longer.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jesse nodded, expression growing serious. He could sense it himself all the way in the West. He chose not to interfere since he had faith in the clans protecting the Eastern side. He also had faith in Hokuto’s power, but perhaps it was his mistake to underestimate their enemy’s potential. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> ‘I’ve been guarding Tokyo’s foundations for two years, but my power alone cannot keep them at bay. They’ve managed to enter my dreams as well, and my body cannot wake up.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Meaning, you are only able to cross dreams for now…” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“And only magic stronger or at par with yours can bring the spirit back into its vessel.”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse had caught on to what Hokuto was implying, and Hokuto could not help but feel apologetic. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I do not mean to ask so much from you—” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Interrupting him, Jesse moved closer to hold Hokuto in an embrace, feeling nothing but warm space. </p><p> </p><p>“Worry not, dear. I think it’s about time I got to see you in physical form too.”</p><p> </p><p>They’d been apart for much longer before, but Jesse would take any chance he could get to reunite with his partner. He was well aware of their responsibilities of guarding their respective lands, but there was still that longing and selfishness in Jesse that tempted him to take it easy and just live a normal life with his love. It was an earthly, human-like emotion, but he felt comfort in having them. </p><p> </p><p>“Leave the rest to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Relieved at Jesse’s answer, Hokuto presses a soft kiss on Jesse’s forehead as a temporary farewell, his figure dispersing into a rain of cherry blossom petals as he disappeared from Jesse’s dream. </p><p> </p><p>Waking up back to reality, Jesse sat up, unnerved by the faintness of Hokuto’s being. </p><p> </p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center"><br/>

<br/>
</p><p>Walking a step behind his <em> boss </em>, Shintaro stretched his aching back after the long flight. If he had a choice, he’d use his own powers to teleport, but Jesse was one of the rare odd ones who was adamant to take the traditional ways of transportation. </p><p> </p><p><em> ‘It’s not all the time that we get to practice what the mortals do,’ </em>Jesse reasoned. As his right hand, Shintaro could only follow and watch Jesse enjoy the inflight snack bar and savor his beer. </p><p> </p><p>Exiting the airport, they were immediately met by a chauffeur at the driveway. As soon as their plane landed, Shintaro notified the chief assistant from the East, aka. his counterpart, that they’ve arrived. As expected, they never fell short in terms of preparation and punctuality (something they ought to work on in their region, he thought.) </p><p> </p><p>Sitting in the back seat, Shintaro could sense the chauffeur stealing glances at them from the rearview mirror from time to time throughout the trip. Jesse didn’t look one bit bothered. Mustering his voice to be as hushed as he could, Shintaro leaned toward Jesse and asked.</p><p> </p><p>“You never told me the reason why we need to intervene.” Shintaro was informed that the Eastern powers were exerting extra force to resist the dark magic and keep their barriers up, but they never sought help in the past. They rarely voiced out any of their troubles within the council. It was unlike them. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse continued staring out the window, watching a bustling city unaware of the formidable power that could easily wreck it in an instant. </p><p> </p><p>“This is Hokuto we’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse had said it so matter-of-factly, and Shintaro somehow understood. </p><p> </p><p>“If someone of his caliber needs to ask for help, then I’m telling you Shintaro. It’s serious.”</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro nodded, looking outside the window too, and sighing at the passing cityscape. It was amazing, he thought, how there were hidden figures fighting and losing their lives to protect an ignorant population. </p><p> </p><p>“Second, he can see the future,” Jesse found it necessary to add. It was an ability he didn’t possess. His expression darkened, and Shintaro imagined an unpleasant chill spreading within the vehicle. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t dare wish to imagine what he’s envisioned if he deems this brewing force out of his control.” </p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><p>They arrive at Shinjuku and stop at the street in front of the government building. Stepping out of the car, Jesse eyes the tall complex and frowns. The barrier surrounding the area wasn’t as strong and impressive as the last time he remembered it to be. </p><p> </p><p>The chauffeur leads them to the ‘gate,’ but both men were already aware of the area’s map. At the center of the square, the view before them warps and changes like they entered a portal. The building disappears, replaced by a temple as if they were transported to another world. </p><p> </p><p>At first, Jesse found it unusual that the quiet Hokuto would choose to sojourn at the government building where it attracted lots of people. He finds out it held the strongest and most vital energy source within the whole of Tokyo, and it amused him that Hokuto would go out of his way to make his illusionary temple his base to take advantage of that. </p><p> </p><p>Upon entering the temple, both he and Shintaro attracted the cautious eyes and curious whispers of the few priest and priestesses guarding the place. Only few had the ability to cross into Hokuto’s ‘world.’ It wasn’t every day that they got visitors. Especially ones from the West. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse already knew his way around to get to Hokuto’s quarters. From the end of the hall where he was headed, he smiles at his partner’s trusted second-in-command. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s been a while,” the man greets them.</p><p> </p><p>“Glad to see you haven’t changed a bit, Kochi.”</p><p> </p><p>Kochi Yugo bids them a warm welcome and leads them to Hokuto’s room. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s been asleep for two years,” Kochi sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“He hasn’t woken up once?” Shintaro asked.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi shook his head, his brows furrowed from worry. “No. He has nightmares sometimes, and despite our efforts to wake him up, it’s as if he was stuck in his dreams.” </p><p> </p><p>Kochi would always be by Hokuto’s side when those nightmares occurred. It frustrated him to merely watch as Hokuto writhed in his sleep, his face showing he was in pain from time to time. He knew it was Hokuto’s sacrifice to suppress the dark energy to protect the land. But aside from being his second-in-command, Hokuto was still his dear friend. Even if he was the strongest that they had, he wished Hokuto wouldn’t shoulder all the responsibility all the time. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re grateful you came all the way here.”</p><p> </p><p>“My pleasure.”</p><p> </p><p>Opening the door to Hokuto’s room, a chill ran up Shintaro’s spine at the wave of energy that rushed past him. The faint and delicate scent of cherry blossoms filled the room despite none being there. It was shrouded in darkness, and at the center was a large bed, carrying a pale figure within white sheets. </p><p> </p><p>Standing across Hokuto’s bed, Jesse crossed his arms and took in his lover’s appearance. His skin was pallid and there was a light sheen of sweat on his forehead. His lips were slightly parted and his shallow breaths were coming out uneven. He was still as beautiful as always, but it left a bitter taste that Hokuto looked weaker after those two years they hadn’t seen each other. </p><p> </p><p>Both Shintaro and Kochi could sense the heavy air surrounding Jesse, and both of them tensed upon seeing the deep frown on his face. </p><p> </p><p>“He appears in my dream sometimes,” Jesse started.  </p><p> </p><p>Kochi turns around, his face surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“He did?”</p><p> </p><p>“He was gradually harder to reach the past months, but he appeared again a few days ago asking for help.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is he okay?” Kochi asked, doing all he can to control his agitation. </p><p> </p><p>“He looked fine.” <em> Much better than the frail physical vessel in front of him</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“I honestly didn’t think it would reach the point he would ask for my help to free him from the binds of the spell he cast upon himself,” Jesse confessed. Only <em>he </em> was able to do so. It was a highly risky move on Hokuto’s end. </p><p> </p><p>Between the two of them, Jesse was infamous for being too headstrong and reckless; he always managed to get himself into different types of danger. But it seems Hokuto also had his martyr moments. He could name a few times when Hokuto was stubborn and lacked self-preservation, but to sacrifice his whole being this way was almost taboo within the council. It just didn’t seem like something Hokuto would do.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse propped himself on the side of Hokuto’s bed and cupped his cold cheek. His eyes fall shut, and his lips part for an incantation he uttered softly, manifesting a circle that glowed and enveloped them in a strong gust of wind. Behind them, Shintaro shut the door making sure no one passing outside could peek. The pitch-dark room was bathed in Jesse’s red light that was reminiscent of hellfire.  </p><p> </p><p>The fiery light rays crawl like tendrils and wrap around Hokuto’s sleeping form, and Kochi’s heart almost jumps out of his chest when Hokuto’s body arches and convulses on the sheets. Jesse straddles his stomach and pins him down, his face void of emotion despite his partner going hysterical and writhing in pain below him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse could figure something was clearly blocking Hokuto’s return to the real world. He lowers himself down to press his forehead against Hokuto’s cold and clammy one. He presses a hand on Hokuto’s chest, following his erratically beating heart that was proof he was still alive and with them. The last spell is uttered in a low voice. The magic concentrated in the hand above Hokuto’s chest releases, and Hokuto screams, a harrowing sound that tore Kochi’s heart. </p><p> </p><p>The last of Hokuto’s binds releases, and he finally opens his eyes. Jesse caresses his face as he watches his body slowly calm down, whispering to him soft words like <em> ‘I’m here,’ ‘I got you,’ ‘You did wonderful, love.’ </em> He brushes away the hair sticking on Hokuto’s forehead, and when Hokuto finally gets a hold of himself and realizes it was Jesse right in front of his eyes, he wraps his arms around Jesse’s neck and pulls himself up for a tight embrace. </p><p> </p><p>From the side, Shintaro pulls Kochi along with him to the door without a word. It was apt for them to leave. After so long, the two needed their time alone together. </p><p> </p><p>Seeing Hokuto finally awake was enough for Kochi. He’ll leave all the questions for later. As soon as they left the room and shut the door, he let out the heaviest sigh of relief like a great weight was lifted off his shoulders. </p><p> </p><p>The magic Jesse had to expel took a toll on him, so he chuckles and slumps right beside Hokuto in bed. Hokuto’s eyes were fixed on him the whole time like he was afraid Jesse would disappear if he looked away. He kisses the bridge of Hokuto’s nose to ease his worries and fixes his robe back to his shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s not like you to come into my dreams for help.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shifted to his side and found Jesse’s hand to link their fingers together.</p><p> </p><p>“I may have overestimated my abilities and gone too far.”</p><p> </p><p>"Have u gotten soft, Hokuto? You wouldn't normally sacrifice yourself even when the council asks you to." Having been with him for so long, Jesse knew a part of him was indifferent about being a magician. He took his responsibilities seriously, but if given a choice, Hokuto would choose to be mortal. </p><p> </p><p>“If I haven’t done it, Tokyo would have been in ruins by now.” </p><p> </p><p>The somber thought left Jesse quiet. Hokuto could see the future, and his visions rarely ever told a lie. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto clutched Jesse’s arm and looked into his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Stay with me,” Hokuto asks of him. “Destruction awaits here, and I need your help.”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at him confusedly. “I would of course take any chance to be with you longer. But if I may ask, why are you so adamant to save this place?” Even at the expense of his own life, he wanted to add. </p><p> </p><p>“Because this is where I met you.” </p><p> </p><p>It was on a full moon in Tokyo when the link between them was pulled for their fates to cross. Hokuto could vividly remember that spark of completion that filled his body when Jesse appeared in front of him. He could also recall the innocence and naivety in Jesse at that time, and he sometimes wished they could go back and restart, somewhere away from all the types of hell they had to live in, but fate wasn’t that kind. </p><p> </p><p>But despite all that, from then on, Hokuto vowed he was ready to sacrifice all that he could to protect the place where he found his other half. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto wasn’t the type of person to be transparent about how he felt, so Jesse felt a warm tug in his heart. He cups Hokuto’s face and kisses his cheek before laying down right beside him and closing his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"I know you’ve just awakened, but would you let me sleep beside you? It's been a long trip." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto eyed him suspiciously and grinned. "Jesse Lewis doesn't need sleep."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't. But within all this chaos, I would like to just rest with you if I could."</p>
