    <h2 class="toc-heading">Teasing</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Everyone had left. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Everyone except Taiga.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They've finished today's concert safely. They felt exhausted but it was so damn fun. Juri and Shin decided to go back together. It seemed like they still had some energy to spend. Jesse had left with Kochi. Everyone knew they got closer after their trip together last month. Even Hokuto really thought that maybe they had lived together since then. Hokuto was watching Taiga sitting in the corner, playing with his phone. Maybe he played a game. Hokuto wasn't sure. There was something weird on Taiga. He had been teasing him for months, especially since they had done filming Shokura. Taiga would just suddenly say something that somehow hurt Hokuto, but at the same time he liked it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">More correctly, he loved it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">But today, it was too much. It was bothering him so much. So, Hokuto decided to talk about it. He walked closer to Taiga and called his name.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Kyomo."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Hmm?" He said without looking back at Hokuto.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Why do you keep calling me annoying?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga didn't say anything. He looked a bit surprised. He faced Hokuto this time.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"What do you mean?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Why do you keep calling me annoying?" He repeated his words.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You've been doing it a lot today… Look, I had fun when you were teasing me, I can understand that we were having fun. But calling me annoying almost out of nowhere is… too much, don't you think?" He was confused. He could just ignore it but this time, he really wanted to know the reasons. He could stand any teasing, but being called "annoying" by Taiga, it was really bothering him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga didn't say anything. He just looked at Hokuto. Hokuto didn't get any expression on his face at that time. He saw Taiga walked to the door, opened it, walked outside for a while, then come back, and locked the door. Hokuto had thousands of words but he decided to keep it in his throat. Taiga walked closer to him, smiling this time. Hokuto could see there was a smirk on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You're so annoying."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto's eyes widened. Not because he got called annoying, but because of the soft thing that touched his own lips. Taiga landed a soft and warm kiss on him. Their lips parted. Hokuto who was still confused, decided to let it be. He grabbed Taiga's neck and kissed him softly. They closed their eyes, letting the warm feeling spread through their lips. Hokuto had always wondered how Taiga's lips taste on him. He got it now. They tasted sweet, soft, warm, and fit him perfectly. They broke the kiss. He saw Taiga smile but there was something deep in his eyes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Why?" Taiga asked breathlessly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You haven't answered me." Hokuto tried to calm himself even though it was so damn difficult. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Isn't it clear enough?" </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I need it verbally." He said it clearly. He could feel his hands trembling. He surely knew the reason of it. He had been holding myself. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I will let you know after this." Taiga attacked him again by pushing him slowly into the wall behind him. The kiss was sexier than before. Hokuto had been dragged too much. He parted his lips, let themselves swifted their tongues. Kissed hungrily and fiercely. Taiga fisted his hand on Hokuto's hair, letting out a moan, meanwhile Hokuto was busy stroking his hands on Taiga's back.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was too much.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Dealing with Taiga was too much. Hokuto wanted to break the kiss but it was so damn difficult. He felt like his body moved by itself. But Taiga broke the kiss, leaving a strand of saliva between them. They looked deeply into each other and Hokuto swore he saw a big desire in Taiga's eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He found Taiga looked so damn beautiful. It was more like, Taiga looked so… breathtaking.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto attacked him first this time, switching their position. He pulled Taiga on the wall. He kissed Taiga's neck, left his mark on it. Then he moved to his ears, licking his moles, and biting it softly. He could hear Taiga was hissing, enjoying every touch on his pale skin. He felt Taiga's hand grabbing his waist slowly, trying to pull out his belt without breaking their fucking kiss. Hokuto did the same to Taiga. Then he took Taiga's ass as if gesturing to curl his leg around him. Hokuto could feel a cock twitching on his abs and made his own getting harder and harder. He looked into Taiga, asked for his permission, and he saw him nodded. He grabbed his own, kept it in front of Taiga's entrance, and entered him slowly. He groaned as Taiga moaned. He grabbed Taiga's other leg to his waist, thrust him on his pace slowly, he wanted to enjoy this moment. He wanted to enjoy Taiga and pleased him without hurting him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You're so fucking tight." Hokuto said breathlessly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"And you're so fucking big!!" Taiga said as he laughed in pleasure, a devil's laugh. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">His thrust was getting faster, giving them so much pleasure. Taiga really moaned a lot. Thankfully Hokuto swallowed it into his throat. He wouldn't let anyone hear it even though their room was locked and soundproof. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Ho-Hokuto… Hokuto… Ahhh hhh I'm- I'm close… I'm so close!! Haaaahhh… Faster, Hokuto!! Faster!! Haaah… "</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Dealing with Taiga was so damn difficult. He really couldn't let him beg for this. He would please him as he wanted, as much as Taiga wanted. He increased his pace, faster and rougher. He could feel he was close too and it was kinda fast, he felt he had spilled it inside Taiga as he felt the other one had spilled over his abs.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They had their kisses back.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Nah.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto wanted to kiss him again, but Taiga tried pulling his face from him. Breathing on Hokuto's lips, touching his nose slowly, teasing him again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You really love teasing me, don't you?" Hokuto said desperately.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"And you love being teased by me, don't you?" Taiga said as he smirked, letting out his breath on Hokuto's lips. He kept it close, so close but not that close for a kiss, and it had made Hokuto desperate. He smooched Taiga's lips and bitted it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Ouch… "</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm sorry. You-... you're the one who teased me. " He stuttered, made the other one let out a chuckle.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You're so annoying… " He said as he landed a kiss on Hokuto's lips. They started everything all over again. They made sure that they still had a lot of milk to spill into each other. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center">
