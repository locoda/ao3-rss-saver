  <em>December 3th, 2021.</em>
</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto was standing in an empty gaze in front of the gravestone with the name <em> Hayato </em>on it. He clenched a flower bouquet in his hand. Hokuto exhaled the air in his lungs. He tried to cover his face from the cold wind that touched his cheeks, holding back his anger that rose inside him by burying his face in his wrapped scarf around his neck. Tears started grimmeringÂ  in his eyes.Â </p><p>Ten years had passed since his little brother left because of <em> that incident </em> â€” a <em> tragic incident. </em>An incident that had been buried deep within him. An incident that caused anger inside him. An incident that has been haunting him. An incident that tore his heart apart.Â Â </p><p>Â </p><p>How profound the wound was, he had never even realized it.Â </p><p>"I'm so sorry, Hayatoâ€¦ "</p><p>Hokuto wiped the tears that streamed down his cheeks. His heartache would never be cured. He didn't even know how many regrets and guilt piled up in his heart.Â </p><p>He put the bouquet on his little brother's grave. Then he turned around and walked away. But his step had stopped when he saw someone.</p><p>Â </p><p>There was a boy.</p><p>Â </p><p>A boy who stood on the side of the road watching him while holding his bicycle, wearing a long sleeved school uniform and red scarf wrapped around his neck. He also brought a black backpack. Hokuto saw the boy smile at him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Eh?..."</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto tried to keep himself from approaching him. However, his curiosity trumps everything. Unknowingly, he stepped towards the boy.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Matsumura Hokuto-san!" The boy said cheerfully with aÂ  bright smile etched on his lips.Â </p><p>Hokuto's eyebrows furrowed. He really didn't know who this boy was. He wanted to ask, but he didn't know how to ask him. He wondered, was this boy someone he knew? The son of his colleague? or his co-worker on the radio? But he never knew any co-workers that lived around here since he came to this area. Then who was he?Â </p><p>He read a name pinned on the boy's right breast pocket.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Michieda Shunsuke.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Who is Michieda Shunsuke?</em>" He thought. He saw the boy kept smiling at him and holding out his hand, waiting to be greeted. Hokuto was still confused with his thoughts about who this boy was, but he chose to greet his hand. He saw the sparkle in the boy's eyes as if he had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</p><p>Â </p><p>"I-Iâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Ummmâ€¦ I- I amâ€¦ one of your big fans, Matsumura-san!!" The boy said while giving a beaming smile.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Aaaahâ€¦"Â  Hokuto said as he shook their hands.Â </p><p>
  <em> "A fan, huh?â€¦"</em>
</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto wanted to let his hand go, but the boy held him tightly. Hokuto gave an uncomfortable smile signaling the boy to loosen his hand.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Ah. I'm sorry, hehe." The boy got it and giggled as he placed his hand behind his neck. He didn't say anything afterwards. He just kept grinning at Hokuto instead. The awkwardness between them only boosted the uncomfortable feeling in Hokuto.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Ummâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>"....You just got back from school?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Ah, yes! My school is a bit far from here, eheeâ€¦ " He grinned and pointed to his left.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto nodded. Honestly, he wasn't really familiar with this area. He used to visit Hayato's grave, indeed, but he didn't try to look around. Not even once. Besides, his hectic schedule won't let him do a tour around here.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Where do you live?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Hmm? It's far enough from here."</p><p>Â </p><p>"........ Do you want to visit us, Matsumura-san? My mother would be grateful if I brought a friend to our house. Especially if he is an <em> ikemen </em> like you!" He laughed shyly as he placed his hands to his mouth.Â </p><p>Â </p><p><em> " </em>... A friendâ€¦ ?"Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Eh? I can't be your friend?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto let out a chuckle.Â </p><p>"I'm too old for you to be called friend. " Hokuto said jokingly. He smiled faintly and turned his face away from the sight of the boy who was pouting.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Go home. Your mother is probably waiting for you." Hokuto said softly.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"........ Okay."</p><p>Â </p><p>"Thank you, Matsumura-san." The boy said as he gave a cheerful smile to Hokuto. He bowed and climbed onto his bicycle as he waved.Â </p><p>Hokuto watched him as he smiled and waved back.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Such a sweet boy."Â </p><p>Â </p><hr/><p>Â </p><p>

  <br/>
</p><p>Taiga was sitting and smiling, welcoming the new patient who was scheduled to see him this afternoon. He greeted the man friendly. He saw him carrying a pack of tissues, hand sanitizer, with hand gloves and a mask on. Before the man sat, he took a few sheets of his tissues and wiped the seat. He dutifully wiped Taiga's desk before putting down his gloved hands. Taiga smiled as he waited for the man to finish cleaning places he considered dirty.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Good afternoon, Fukazawa-san."Â </p><p>"Please have a seat. "</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga paid attention to every detail of Fukazawa's story. How people around him complain about him as a hygiene freak who washes his own hands 50 times a day. How he cleans his house continuously without stopping. How he loves everything to be clean so much and thinks his surroundings are always dirty.</p><p>Â </p><p>"I can understand why you do that. But don't you think it would be a bit tiring if you keep doing it?" Taiga asked as he smiled.</p><p>"Yeahâ€¦ actually I do feel tired but I can't live without doing it. I feel like it's so dirty if I don't clean them."</p><p>Â </p><p>"I see."</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga wrote something on his notes and gave it to Fukazawa.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"First, I will prescribe a medicine for you. Then we will have some therapy for this. I know you can't live without doing it. But I don't want you to get tired all the time because you keep cleaning everything before you touch them. Okay?"</p><p>Taiga saw Fukazawa let out a long sigh, then he nodded.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Here's your prescription. See you next time, Fukazawa-san." He said as he saw him walk out from his room.</p><p>Taiga leaned back in his chair, checking the time on his watch.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"One more hour to goâ€¦ "</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga was eager to return home. Today was more tiring than usual. The number of patients he meets for scheduled counseling had increased due to the absence of Kochi, his senpai and housemate. Taiga saw him pale this morning, and asked him to rest. He also told Kochi that he was willing to take his place if the need arises.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Why did I offer myself to himâ€¦ " Taiga said as he massaged his temples. He started regretting being nice to him when he remembered how annoying Kochi would be. Taiga closed his eyes, wanting to get some sleep but then someone knocked on his door.Â </p><p>"<em>Kyomoto-sensei,</em> your last patient is here."</p><p>Taiga got up from his chair, tilting his back and nodding as he gave a permit to let his last patient in.Â </p><p>"Good afternoon. Please have a seat."</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Â </p><p>The night was dense and the air was colder than usual. The streets looked busier than before. Everything seemed to be in a hurry. The sound of cars, the trains, the buses and the bustle. Everything was colliding. The night was totally crowded.Â </p><p>Taiga let out a deep sigh. He had planned to go home faster after his last counseling. But it had to be canceled because Matsumoto Jun called him and gave him a lot of work to be done.Â </p><p>More precisely, it was Kochi's work that was given to him and had to be handed in before tomorrow morning. Thankfully Taiga managed to finish it at the right time even though it drained his energy.Â </p><p>"Can't I just fly home?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga just really wanted to go home. He needed to recharge his energy and he could do it by eating sweets or Shin's cooking like he used to do, or sleeping beautifully, reading some manga, or watching his favorite anime. But that night, he wanted something else, a simple thing, though. But kinda difficult to do.Â </p><p>He wanted to meet his boyfriend, Juri.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>It had been two weeks since the last time they met. The barrier was common, they were too busy with their job. They even barely texted each other for a week because Juri was too busy. It should be common for them if they remembered how frequently Juri went out of the city because his job had to be done. It should be common for them.Â </p><p>Taiga should have gotten used to it. But no, he couldn't.</p><p>Not yet, perhaps? He didn't know.</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga reached for the phone in his pocket and took out his earphones. As he placed them into his ears, he played a song from his favorite playlist.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>The song brought him back a piece of memory in his mind. A funny memory for Taiga, who was captivated by a sound for the first time. Actually, the song that Taiga played was a ballad song that tells a story about how deep and beautiful love is, but causes a heartache that is hard to be cured. It is such a dramatic song, indeed. But Taiga loved it.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He still loves it.</p><p>Â </p><p>Not exactly because of the meaning of the song. More precisely, because of the voice he heard at that time. Also Taiga hadn't known that the song might be the start of everything in his life.</p><p>Everything started when he found Shin in his room. Shin was whining while listening to the same song as he is playing right now. Taiga really thought it was just one of Shin's Collection Ballad Songs until he realized a voice afterwards. A very deep voice, captivating, comforting, yet so addicting. Taiga walked closer to Shin who was lying on his bed with his puffy eyes. He took a seat on his bed, letting Shin seek warmth in his embrace. Taiga didn't have intentions to sit longer at first. Especially since the voice wasn't from a woman. But then it was hypnotizing him, making him stunned. So he chose to sit longer than he was going to. He couldn't help, but enjoy every topic sprinkled with light laughter in it. Without him noticing, a thin line etched at the corner of his lips.</p><p>Â </p><p>
  <b> <em>Ping!Â </em></b>
</p><p>A notification from his phone distracted him. He took off one of his earphones.Â </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>"Kyomo!!"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"I'm backâ™¡"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"I've missed you!!"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"I really really missed you!!"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"Oh! I've bought your favorite karee! I will meet you tonight."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"...Ummâ€¦ Is Kochi at home? He wouldn't mind if I come, right?"Â </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"<em>Baka... </em>" Taiga mumbled to no one. He couldn't help, but smile. His longing seemed to be answered. His fatigue seemed to decrease. He typed as fast as he could, then walked to the bus stop.Â </p><p>Â </p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">"<em>Hahaha. I'll be back soon :)"Â </em></p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>The universe seemed to be on Taiga's side.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>At least, that was what he thought.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>It was 22.50 o'clock. 10 minutes before the last bus schedule, Taiga rushed to the bus stop in front of him. He could see a group of people waiting, as if they were ready to enter the bus that hadn't passed yet. Some of them were chit chatting, reading, gaming, and listening to something from their earphones. Taiga just stared ahead and occasionally checked the clock on his left hand. The time felt longer. Taiga reached for the phone in his pocket. He couldn't wait to see his lover. He wanted to send a quick message, but a fuss from the other end of the street disturbed him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He neglected it by forcing himself to keep his eyes on his phone, reaching for his earphones and putting it back on his ears.Â </p><p>Â </p><p><b> <em>BRUG!</em> </b> <em> Â  </em></p><p>Â </p><p>Someone hit his shoulder and knocked him down.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Ouch!!" He hissed as he placed his hand on his shoulder.Â </p><p>"Could youâ€¦ ple-...." Taiga's eyes widened when he saw a middle-aged man in front of him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>
  <em> "Why is he here? How can he come out?"Â </em>
</p><p>Â </p><p>The pain that rose on his shoulder and his feet was nothing compared to the thought that filled his head. Taiga tried to reach the man slowly.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Sa-sawamura-san?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"...Sawamura-san, are you okay?" Taiga saw there was fear in his eyes. He tried to calm him down, but it was a waste. A man called Sawamura stood up and pushed Taiga down again, causing pain on his elbow after he hit the roadside. He even yelled at Taiga and startled him. Sawamura was totally raging.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT PLACE!!!!!!"</p><p>Â </p><p>"I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga could see how fear was wrapped in Sawamura. He ran as fast as he could, but Taiga knew Sawamura had no clue where to go. Taiga stood up and tried fighting back the pain in his body. He was facing toward and started to sprint. Cold air bit into his lungs. A sweat covered his neck. In unsteady breathing, Taiga really did his best to run towards him. But at this bad speed, he could barely see Sawamura in front of him. Crying in frustration, Taiga called Sawamura as loud as he could even though he knew Sawamura would never hear him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Sawamura-saan!!"Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"SAWAMURA-SAAAAAN!!!!"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga saw Sawamura running towards the convenience store across the street as if he didn't see the cars passing in front of him. He was shouting, running, evading whoever was behind him. Taiga's voice was literally nothing, but a night haze to him. Worries spread on Taiga's veins. His t-shirt was already wet and his body covered by sweat even though the night was cold as hell. Taiga spotted a cab that was parked by the side of the road. His eyes widened in disbelief when he saw Sawamura enter the cab and took over the wheel. He was in a hurry and almost hit a silver car that passed beside him. Taiga's breath hitched. The loud horn startled him. Thankfully he didn't take off his earphones as it might have disturbed his hearing.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga squinted his eyes as he saw a man with curly hair and wearing a dark gray suit was getting out of his car.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Anoooooâ€¦.!!!" Taiga yelled before he tried to reach the man. He could feel his blood was running on his veins. His calves burned and his breath formed clouds in the air. With an unsteady heartbeat, Taiga half ran to the man who was clearly grumbling.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Haah.. Haaaaaah...."</p><p>Â </p><p>"Excus-... Excuse me.... H-haahâ€¦"Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Could-..... " Taiga swallowed and catched some air to his lungs.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Could you please help me?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Ummâ€¦ That cab!! Please help me get the cab!"</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>Taiga could see the man had frowned. There was a slight annoyance in his eyes.Â </p><p>It took a few minutes for Taiga to get his steady breath, but he still hadn't gotten any answer. His lips parted, he was going to ask the same question, but he didn't have to.Â </p><p>"I'm sorry?" What-... "</p><p>Â </p><p>"I'm his doctor!"</p><p>The man looked into Taiga in disbelief, but Taiga didn't want to bother to explain. He looked the other direction to find the cab, but he didn't find it. Thankfully, he managed to remember the plate number. He forcibly asked the man again.Â </p><p>"Please!! Please help me! I will explain everything to you later. Please!!" Taiga begged for the man's kindness.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Ckâ€¦" He looked irritated and didn't say anything, yet he had let Taiga entered his car. They drove quickly after Sawamura who actually couldÂ  no longer be seen. Taiga couldn't deny that he was worried, but he managed to control himself. Taiga shamelessly said something that made the man clucked again.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Can you please drive a bit faster? We need to get him sooner. Oh I remember the plate, don't worry."Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga saw how hard the man pushed the pedal, as if he forgot Taiga's existence beside him. His body tensed, his hands clenched at the grip. Well, taiga did ask him to be faster, but he also wanted this man to drive carefully. However, he still wanted to meet Juri and eat Shinâ€™s cooking.Â </p><p>Taiga tried his best to feel safe on his seat, then he reached for his phone. He pushed the button as he should had done.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Yes. This is Psychiatrist Kyomoto Taiga from Tokyo Matsuzawa Hospital."</p><p>"I want to report that there is a Schizophrenia patient driving a white cab. Yes. The plate number is J12***. Yes, could you please help me to find it? Yes, thank you."</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga turned his face to his side and found the man was mumbling beside him.Â </p><p>"A Schizophrenia?"</p><p>Taiga didn't answer him. He called another number instead to ask for more help.</p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Hello. </em>" The voice on the other end sounded authoritative.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Sir, my apologies for bothering you at this hour. Do you remember one of our patients, Sawamura-san? I saw him outside, he's trying to run away in a cab, Sir."Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Aaaah his girlfriend was calling? Aah...Could you please send me her number, Sir? And please help me to call his family too. Thank you, Sir. "</p><p>Â </p><p>Another call came to Taiga's phone. He was so busy with those dozens of calls, making him not realize how many times the man beside him glanced at him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Hello, yes this is Kyomoto Taiga, Sawamura's doctor.Â  Did he take his prescriptions? His episode wouldn't come like this if he had taken them properly."</p><p>Â </p><p>"Aaah I seeâ€¦ Why didn't he take them?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga was speechless. His face turned pale, a sweat slowly dripped down his forehead. Taiga took a deep breath, filling his lungs with air as much as he could. His lips made a thin line, trying to keep calm before he let out his words.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Ahâ€¦ <em> ehem </em>. Sexâ€¦ Umm, yeah okay. Umm, since when did he stop taking his meds?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"...... Aaah okay, I understand. Please come to the hospital soon. Yes, thank youâ€¦ "</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga had closed his call. He wiped his sweat, and tried to breathe steadily as he cleaned his throat. A man beside him once again took a glance at him and he realized how pale Taiga's lips turned out to be.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Are you okay?" He asked softly. But Taiga didn't hear him since another call came, again. But this time was from his junior, Fuma.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Fuma! Yeah I'm fine, don't worry." Taiga said as if he read the man's mind.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Ah, Fuma. Could you please help me bring lorazepam and haloperidol for Sawamura-san? Yes, for more details, you can ask Matsumoto-san, Ok? I'm closing."</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga let out a long and deep sigh. He leaned back on the seat. He placed his arm on his forehead as he closed his eyes. The night seemed quiet. Taiga looked at his watch and saw that it was almost 01.10 o'clock. No wonder he felt the road was quiet. Taiga felt his body kinda warm. Today was exhausting. His energy drained a lot. He couldn't help, but feel sleepy as his eyes shut slowly. But then a man beside him woke him up with his heavy voice.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"He's so good at driving. How could he be so good at it?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga could only look at him. He didn't have any energy to answer him. He really wanted to sleep but his body had tensed again as he found the man shrinking his shoulders and straightening up on his seat.Â </p><p>"Hold on! I definitely will end this."</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga swallowed hard as he saw the man looked determined to do something that Taiga never expected. He shut his eyes hard after seeing the man once again push his pedal, harder this time. Taiga held his breath because he was scared this would affect the speed of the car. His warm body had turned colder this time.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga was freaking out.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He was freaking out, yet he tried to open his eyes and saw the speed of their car was almost the same as Sawamura's cab. Taiga was going to ask Sawamura to pull over, but he couldn't do that, because their car was faster than him.</p><p>Â </p><p>"What are you doing?!!" Taiga asked, panicking. But the man didn't say anything. Taiga saw him clenched his jaw, fisted his hands on the wheel and his sharp eyes made Taiga understand.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Don't do thatâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>"...Oh please don't do thatâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga shut his eyes tight when he saw the man push his pedal harder. He clenched his left hand on the grip meanwhile the other one was busy trying to find anything to be a handler. He didn't have any guts to see what would happen next. He could feel his body spin. Nah. The car was spinning and his body hit hard on the side of the car.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga felt a warm arm holding him, protecting him from knocking forward when they stopped suddenly. He opened his eyes and found where their car was parked when he saw Sawamura was speeding towards them. His heart beating faster, his breathing hitched, blood running on his veins, a bunch of beautiful memories crossed his mind as he kept his eyes open for the last time.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"I'm sorry, Juriâ€¦ " Taiga loosening his grip and closing his eyes.</p><p>Â </p><hr/><hr/><p>Â </p><p>The noise from the outside ran into his ears, waking him up and making him realize that he was holding his breath. Taiga had opened his eyes slowly as he realized that the night was still going.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Are you done?" The man beside him asked him. He made a thin line on his lips as he held back his laugh.</p><p>Taiga fell silent. His face turned as red as a tomato. He got out of the car without any words. His heartbeat was too loud and panicking through his body was too much, causing him not to be aware that the ambulance and police had been following him. Taiga saw Sawamura laid by on the road. He kicked the air, screamed and thrashed. He made the officer exhausted. Taiga slightly ran closer to them.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Is this 3 mL Lorazepam?"</p><p>"Yes, <em>senpai </em>."</p><p>"Flip him. Move a bit." Taiga asked their help. He bent over to reach Sawamura who was already facing down by force on the road.</p><p>"Sawamura-sanâ€¦ Sawamura-san, I will give you a tranquilizer, okay!" Taiga opened the injection with his teeth and injected it through his abdomen. They flipped him back and Taiga tried to reach his arms.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Sawamura-san, it's okay. You will be calm now. It's okay." Taiga said as he reached Sawamura's arms and stroked it gently as he comforted him. Sawamura had started calming but there was still a hint of fear in his eyes. Taiga stood up and signaled to the officer to move.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Please take him, quickly. Call his family, and don't forget to check his vitals."Â </p><p>Â </p><p><em>"Otsukaree!"</em> Taiga said breathlessly. He watched them drive away one by one, leaving him alone on the street.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga let out a long sigh. He had stretched his back and loosened his tensed muscle in his whole body. It was exhausting and he could feel there was no energy left inside him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"That's impressive." The man with curly hair startled him. Taiga forgot that he wasn't alone. The man had stood behind him, lookingÂ  amazed.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"... Thanks, I guess." He let out a chuckle as he massaged his shoulder. Taiga felt his whole body was aching. He was drained. He shook his head when his vision got blurry, trying to bring back his focus.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Can you take me back to the hospital? I need to check Sawamura."</p><p>Â </p><p>"My car is out of gas. I'm not sure we can get there." He said softly.Â </p><p>Once again, Taiga took a deep breath. He reached for his phone and tried to ask for some help. But before he clicked the button, his legs were loosening and couldn't support his body. Everything was black out. He almost fell hard to the ground but someone catched his arm and pulled him into his embrace.</p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Sensei?</em>"</p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Senseiâ€¦?</em>"</p><p>Taiga still could hear a voice called his name â€” a very familiar voice. He felt a cold palm placed on his cheeks and shook his body gently as he heard his name called by again and again. But then he couldn't hear anything as he lost his consciousness completely.Â </p><p>Â </p><p align="center">*****</p><p align="center">Â </p><p>Taiga opened his eyes and blinked slowly as he scanned around him. The white wall and the smell of medicine filled the room. He was going to close his eyes again but then he heard another familiar voice beside his bed.Â </p><p>"Taigaâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>"What happened? You haven't eaten yet? I don't think you would be this weak if you had eaten."</p><p>Â </p><p>"Kochi..." Taiga woke up from his bed and saw Kochi looking at him in worry.Â </p><p>"Kochi, are you okay? How's Sawamura-san?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Thanks for worrying me but I'm okay. Don't worry. Sawamura-san is already okay. He moved to our department. They had called his family and Matsumoto-san already explained everything to them."</p><p>Taiga nodded and let out a sigh of relief. He closed his eyes for a while as he remembered how hectic it was last night. He hoped Sawamura would feel safer as he moved into the psychiatrist departmentâ€” their department.</p><p>As Taiga opened his eyes, he smelled something really good around him. He turned his face to his left and found his favorite food served on his desk.Â </p><p>"Tomato soup!!!" Taiga said cheerfully with a bright smile on his lips. His eyes sparkling as he took the soup, sipped it hurriedly, feeding his hungry body.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Hey Taiga... "</p><p>"Hmmm?" He didn't move his gaze from the soup on his hands. He didn't let his mouth stop chewing.</p><p>"How do you know him?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Who?" Taiga still didn't move his eyes.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Ckâ€¦. Hokuto."</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga had stopped chewing when he heard the name. He turned his face to Kochi who looked at him in wonder. He swallowed his food before saying his next words.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Who's Hokuto?" He said as he reached the glass of water on his desk.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Hokuto!! Matsumura Hokuto!! The man who brought you here last night!!"</p><p>Taiga had choked. He really forgot about that man. Also, he didn't think he knew him.Â </p><p>"Kochi, believe me. I don't know him. I accidentally met him last night and forced him toâ€”..... " His face was getting warm when he started realizing how shameless he was last night.Â </p><p>"Ehem. Well, I don't know him, ok!"Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"....... I shouldn't have forgotten that you're such an idiot." Kochi's eyes squinted in disbelief. He forgot his friend could be this stupid somehow.Â </p><p>Taiga didn't give any response. More correctly, he didn't hear it. It was like a wind passing by his ears. He was busy chewing a strawberry shortcake that he took after he finished his soup.</p><p>"Do you remember a movie about a chair and a cat? The one that you really wanted to watch."Â </p><p>Taiga placed the cake on his lap as he let out a long sigh.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Suzume, Kochi. It's Suzume..."Â </p><p>"Of course I do!!" Taiga said it clearly while pouting. He really wanted to watch it. But his hectic schedule didn't let him steal any time for this.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Matsumura was one of the seiyuu of it! You don't even recognize his voice. Seriouslyâ€¦ "</p><p>Â </p><p>Taiga had tried to remember every piece of his memory last night. Yet he still didn't think he ever heard nor seen him. Well, his face looked familiar though but he couldn't remember where he saw Matsumura before.</p><p>"Have I ever met him before?" Taiga was mumbling.Â </p><p>"Well, I remember the trailer butâ€¦. I don't know, he sounded differentâ€¦" Taiga's eyes shut off as he recalled the voice in his ears.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"â€¦â€¦ Also I forgot to check the name of the actor, soâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Baka</em>."</p><p>Taiga had sensed Kochi glared at him. But he chose to ignore it and enjoyed his Â¾ cake that tasted so tender. Not long after, someone knocked on his door â€” a boy in short pants and a long-sleeved t-shirt ran to him and pulled him into a tight hug.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Aaaaâ€¦ Shin!!!"</p><p>Taiga whined as he patted Shin's back, telling him to loosen his tight embrace as Taiga tried to catch some air.Â </p><p>"Ah. I'm sorry." Shin said while grinning then he took off his embrace. Taiga saw Shin kept peeking at the door and asked someone behind it to come in. He was wondering who would come? His friend? Nah. Taiga doesn't have any friends beside his co-workers. Then who? A friend of Shin? Or Kochi?</p><p>Taiga tried to peek at the door even though it was useless because he couldn't see anyone. But then a man with gray-ash hair, wearing a black jacket with a necklace and a hat came in. He brought a bouquet and a pack of tomatoes in his hands. He gave a smile. A beaming smile and crinkled eyes that caused a warm inside Taiga's heart. A smile that Taiga had not seen for a long time. A smile he had missed so much.Â </p><p>"Juri!!!!" Taiga said cheerfully. His eyes shining and his heart pounding so loud. His cheeks lifted as he exposed his teeth, giving him a bright smile.Â </p><p>"Kyomo." Juri smiled as he waved at him. He walked closer to Taiga, reaching his arms around Taiga's back. Taiga buried his face around Juri's neck, letting Juri's scents fill his lungs. The longing that had been gnawing at his body for so long seemed to have disappeared. His heart filled with love and joy.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Juri. I didn't get to meet you last night." Taiga said while pouting. He had taken off the hug but still kept his hands around Juri's waist.Â </p><p>"That's fine. I'm already here."Â  Juri said as he placed his fingers on Taiga's forehead while getting rid of the bangs that bothered his eyes. Taiga closed his eyes as he felt the warmth of Juri's touch on him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Kyomo, you need to cut your hair a bit, don't you think?"</p><p>"Hmmm?" Taiga blinked. His eyes followed Juri's fingers on his forehead. He tried to see how long his bangs this time.</p><p>"... Yeah, I think so too... But I have to go to work in 2 hrs and I still have a lot of things to do."</p><p>"You didn't bring my clothes, right?" Taiga turned his face to Shin, waking him up from his reverie.</p><p>"Huh?... Yeah, I didn't. Why would I?"</p><p>"You're supposed to, <em> baka </em>." Kochi answered for Taiga as he slapped Shin's back softly.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Alright. Let's go home!" Taiga asked as his eyes squinted slightly.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Take care, you guys! I have to work now." Kochi helped Taiga with his stuff before he went back to his own work.</p><p>Â </p><hr/><p>Â </p><p>
  <em> January 7th, 2022. </em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Alright, Michi. I will meet you next week. Okay, bye!" Hokuto closed his call with a smile. He had been friends with Michi after meeting him a few times at Hayato's grave. Even though it was more like Hokuto couldn't ignore Michi who kept waiting him and talking to him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Who?" Jesse asked as he suddenly appeared in front of Hokuto's door.</p><p>"A friend." Hokuto said proudly.Â </p><p>Jesse's eyes widened. He looked in disbelief. Hokuto barely had any friends. As far as Jesse knows, he was the only friend that Hokuto has since high school.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"What friend?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Why would you have to know?" Hokuto said as his eyebrows furrowed. He felt annoyed with Jesse's question. He took a script on his desk and tried ignoring Jesse who walked closer to him.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"Hey, Hokuto."</p><p>Â </p><p>"... Hmmmm?" Hokuto answered without looking at Jesse who had taken a seat in front of him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Do youâ€¦ have plans to reveal your identity?</p><p>Hokuto turned his face to Jesse as his eyebrows furrowed. He knew exactly what Jesse talked about.Â </p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Why did Jesse have to ask about it again? Why did he have to ask the reason Hokuto used his brother's name as his identity on his radio? Why did Jesse have to ask if Hokuto had plans to reveal who Hayato was? Wasn't it obvious enoughÂ  that Hokuto had given a clear statement about it many times?Â </p><p>"Jesse, I've said it many times, right? I've been using it for years. All the staff are already familiar with it. I've told them my reason for hiding my real identity, right? They respected itÂ  and that's enough."</p><p>Jesse let out a long sigh as if he had lost any excuse to beat Hokuto. Also, Jesse just wanted Hokuto to open himself to his fans so they would listen to his radio â€” a subtle way to say the words of <em> to increase their listeners </em> because it would be good for Hokuto too. His radio was popular enough, and if he could be more popular, that would be good. But Hokuto didn't want it. He wanted to keep it as it was. His life had changed since his debut as <em> seiyuu </em>. It didn't mean that he didn't feel grateful for that, but he had trouble enough with his popularity. He didn't want to add more trouble by telling those people that he was the same person as Hayato on his Saturday Radio.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>More precisely, he didn't want them to find out about his family.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>His broken familyâ€¦Â </p><p>Â </p><p>The ringing sound of Jesse's phone distracted the discomfort that had arisen between them. Hokuto returned to his script in his hand, meanwhile Jesse answered his call. Hokuto could hear a woman's voice from Jesse's call. He had recognized who was the owner of that comforting voice from the start.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Okaasanâ€¦ </em>"</p><p>"Hokuto? Yeah he just turned off his phone." Jesse said as he saw Hokuto on his desk. He gave Jesse a soft smile as he signaled to leave him alone. He watched Jesse walk away from his room. Hokuto knew that Jesse didn't want to bother him with his loud voice this time. Especially when he held his script in his hand. So Jesse moved into another room. But, it wasn't that far because Hokuto could still hear him.Â </p><p>Hokuto unintentionally paid attention to their talks about what had happened before. Jesse said it clearly that Hokuto was on the phone with someone else. Actually, Hokuto felt guilty towards his mother. He knew that his busy schedule made him stressed and things were getting worse. His mother had difficulty calling him, yet he had let Michi called him a few times. He also still couldn't visit her for weeks. He had plans to live together with his mother at his place, though. But he still needed a new home because his current home only has one room. It was too small for 3 people. Jesse offered him so many houses, but Hokuto still hadn't given any answers yet.Â </p><p>"Your mom whined about you again this time. You really need to call her or visit her sooner." Jesse walked in through the door after he finished his call. Hokuto didn't say anything. He kept his eyes on his script while his mind was somewhere.Â </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>"... Hey, Jesse."</p><p>Â </p><p>"Hmmmm?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"..... I don't want to move. I will just renovate my current houseâ€¦.. It's possible, right?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto raised his face. He smiled as he saw Jesse looked at him in confusion.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"... It'sâ€¦ possible. But it might take a lot of time. Also, where are you gonna live when your house is being renovated? You wouldn't stay there, would you?"</p><p>Jesse was right. Hokuto couldn't stay at his current house, but he already thought about that. He had been thinking of renting a small apartment for a while, closer to Hayato's grave. So he could visit him as much as he wanted. He could meet Michi easier. Also, he wanted something new for a while. His work gave him a lot of pressure. His current situation was exhausting. He might explode soon. He just wanted something as a distraction. Something fresh. Something strong enough to shake off the lingering exhaustion within him.Â </p><p>"I've found a place to live for a while." He said as he smiled. Jesse didn't say anything afterwards. It hadn't started yet but Hokuto felt excitement had arisen inside him.Â </p><p>Â </p><hr/><p>Â </p><p>Taiga was sitting on his couch, texting Kochi to go back earlier because they would have a party. Shin was busy preparing their food. Meanwhile Juri was busy receiving many calls from his work. Juri worked as a professional photographer. Somehow, Taiga wanted to whine about how busy Juri was. But he couldn't do it because he knew Juri loved his job. Taiga also couldn't deny that because of that, they could meet and become lovers until now. So Taiga tried to deal with it.Â </p><p>Â </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Sorry, Taiga. I canâ€™t go back now. I still have a bunch of paper to be done. Matsumoto-san might kill me if I didn't give this to him tomorrow..</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>...Besides, I don't want to see him</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Â </p><p>Taiga let out a sigh after reading Kochi's reply. He knew it clearly that Kochi wanted to stay away from Juri. He said that Juri could be dangerous. Well, deep down in his heart, Taiga had been aware about their relationship as this was his first time. But he didn't want to think about it. Even though he knew that Kochi had a good sense.Â </p><p>Also he had started loving Juri. For the first time, he fell in love with someone. He wanted to try that. He wanted to be cured. He wanted to believe he could. Despite knowing how difficult it would be for him, for them, yet Taiga still wanted it. That's why he accepted to be in this relationship.</p><p>Â </p><blockquote>
  <p align="right">
    <em>Okay, Kochi. That's fine!</em>
  </p>
  <p align="right">
    <em>But I'll be waiting for you :)</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Â </p><p>Taiga smiled. He loved teasing Kochi. He loved both, Kochi and Juri, and he really hoped his beloved people could be friends.</p><p>"Kochi wouldn't come, would he?" Juri asked as he took a seat beside Taiga.</p><p>"... He still has a lot of work."</p><p>Juri only nodded as he brought his face down. But Taiga could see Juri's frown look. It caused uncomfortable feelings between them. Thankfully Shin appeared at the right moment. He brought a big set of <em>oden</em>. They agreed that they would have a <em>nabemono</em> tonight to celebrate his late birthday. Well, Taiga had celebrated it but it was only with Shin. Juri was out of the town and Kochi was busy with his bunch of work.Â </p><p>"Isn't it too big for us?" Juri said as he saw the pot.</p><p>Taiga was sure Shin had said that it was just a small party, but he agreed with Juri. The food was exactly the opposite. Shin came again with some plates of <em>o</em><em>hitashi</em> and <em>karaage</em> as their side dish. He didn't forget about the strawberry cake as their dessert. Taiga wasn't complaining though. He loves food and Shin's cooking is always good. So he would just enjoy everything Shin cooked for him.Â </p><p>Juri asked Taiga to take it first because he wanted Taiga to taste the first bite. Taiga's eyes widened as he spotted a sausage in their Oden . A rose blooming on Taiga's cheeks as he looked at Juri who served him with it because he knew sausage is Taiga's main favorite. Taiga ate it peacefully, tasting how juicy it was. But it was not enough for Taiga so he took another item. He added two pieces of tempura Â to his bowl and poured them with lemon citrus paste. He didn't even realize how messy he was while eating.Â </p><p>Juri couldn't help it but spoiled Taiga more. Juri's touch was enough to surprise him a bit as he wiped leftover food on his lips. Juri let out a chuckle, making Taiga blushed as he tried to cover his face by his palm. They had enjoyed it a lot. They didn't even realize they had caused a jealousy on Shin as he looked at them with his puppy eyes. Taiga placed his arms around Shin's shoulder, giving him a gentle squeeze, apologizing for making him jealous. But at the same time, Taiga found it was a bit funny. He felt bad for Shin yet he couldn't hold his chuckle.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Alright Kyomo, make a wish!" Juri said as he took the cake in the corner and passed it to him. Taiga crossed his fingers as he closed his eyes, feeling delighted to meet his beloved people if he remembers how hard his past was and how hard he tried to go through it. How dark his past was and how hard he worked to find a light to go out from that cave. He really felt grateful to be alive until this day.Â </p><p>Taiga etched a bright smile as he heard how loud how loud Shin and Juri were clapping their hands and shouting out after he blew out the candle that said 30 on it.Â </p><p>He hoped for nothing but happiness for him and his people.</p><p>Â </p><hr/><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto had arrived in front of a small building. His eyes scanned fast around him and saw no one was there except him. The night was quite calm and cold. Hokuto moved his feet slowly towards the hallway of the building. He heard nothing but his footsteps and his steady breath. He walked upstairs and stopped when he arrived in front of room number 109. He reached for the key in his pocket and put it into the keyhole. He opened the door slowly. The room was dark and smelled misty. Hokuto came in and brought all of his boxes inside. He screened the room with his eyes and his lips wide open, feeling amazed with the architecture of the room. It was simple but beautiful. The room was big enough for someone who lived alone. The gray color painted well on the empty and thin wall. The floor was made from ceramic tiles with the same color as the wall. A small window beside the bed in the corner is such a perfect place to grow a plant. The kitchen has two empty black cabinets with two double doors. Hokuto made sure he would fill it with his cups and bowls. The sink is below the cabinet doors, a refrigerator around 20 inches from on the right of the sink, and a microwave on the opposite.</p><p>His new apartment has one bedroom with a single bed and a heater in the corner. One bathroom, kitchen, and a small wardrobe. It was more like an armoire. Hokuto checked it which was opposite from his bed. He touched the surface, checking every detail of it. Then opened the door to check inside.Â </p><p>"Hmm. It's quite big. It should be enough." He said as he closed the door.</p><p>Hokuto purposely searched for a place that made his existence faintly visible. He really didn't want to be bothered for a while. A small apartment in this area is indeed the right choice. Not many people choose to live in remote places like this because it's far from the city. He got these places by checking many websites on the internet. There were a lot of places similar to this but it was far from Hayato's grave. He could say he was lucky to find this place at a cheap price. Hokuto went outside to check the room beside him. And how happy he was when he found out that two rooms on his sides were empty. He was alone on the second floor.Â </p><p>"Perfect!" He muttered while carving a smile on his lips. Hokuto reached for his phone in his back pocket and pressed his contact button.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Hello, Jesse."</p><p>"Yeah, I've arrived safely."</p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Is there anything you need?</em>"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Yeah umm, can you help me deliver my belongings that are left behind? Yes, in my room. Thank you~"</p><p>Â </p><p>Normally, it took around one and a half hours for him to get to this place from his house. And it could be different if the traffic was busier and crowded. But it didn't take so long for him to get his belongings. Jesse managed to deliver it in less than one hour.</p><p>Â </p><p>"As expected, Jesse." He said proudly to his best friend.</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto was on fire as his body moved by itself.Â  He began to organize his belongings. A collection of books had neatly arranged on a shelf that he had bought a long time ago. Some of his favorite eccentric paintings were also displayed on the walls of his room. His clothes, which were not much, had also been placed neatly in his wardrobe. He also placed his kitchenware into the cabinet. He cleaned his room and placed a lavender candle beside his bed.Â </p><p>"Finished." He sighed in relief.</p><p>Â </p><p>The jazz music that he had been playing earlier was still left ON, meanwhile he was busy spending a little time in the bathroom. He let the warm water pour over his body, washing the exhaustion within him. Hokuto was busy with his work then went back and moved to his new place. Such a long day for him and he could only sigh in relief after finishing his tough day.Â </p><p>He dried his body, put on his pajamas, andÂ  finished a piece of hamburger with a cup of coffee that he had bought while on the way. He took his phone beside him. It was 23.30, which seemed a bit late to call someone. But Hokuto had to do this. He had to call this person as he was supposed to.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Okaasaan</em>â€¦ " He said softly as his eyes crinkled slightly.Â </p><p>"<em>Hokuto!! How's your moving?</em>" The woman on the other side answered with her comforting voice.Â </p><p>"Hmm, it was good. I love this place."</p><p>"<em>Why don't you just stay here with me?</em>" She asked in a tone that sounded whiny. A slight line etched on his lips. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the cold air.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Let's live together in my place later."</p><p>Â </p><p>He could hear his mother let out a snort. Hokuto didn't say anything. He understood her situation so well that her mom only needed someone beside her. That was also the reason he let Jesse to take care of her.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Okaasaan</em>, I'm gonna sleep now."Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"<em>Have you prepared your bed well?</em>"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Yeah. Don't worry. It's quite big and comfy. I can sleep there." He said as he turned his face to the bed that they talked about.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"It's late. We have to sleep. Good night." He pecked his phone as if he sent a small kiss to his beloved woman. He cleaned his table, washed his dishes, then walked into his bedroom. He turned off the music that had been playing the same song. He turned the lamp into a dim light. He opened the armoire, tidying up the clothes inside, bringing his pillow, and locking himself from inside.Â </p><p>Â </p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto had woken up from his sleep. He had finished stretching in front of his window to get some sunlight. He took a shower, changed his clothes, then walked to his kitchen, preparing his coffee and a waffle. He took his breakfast slowly while reading his script. He had planned to practice for his next project.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Brug!</em> </strong>
</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto was startled. He heard something from the wall. Seemed like it came from the room beside him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"What was that?" He murmured to himself.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He was confused. He was pretty sure that no one was living on the second floor of this apartment.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Brug!</strong> </em>
</p><p>Â </p><p>He was startled again. This one was a bit louder than before. Hokuto started worrying. Not by the ghost butâ€¦ there might be someone beside his room. He walked outside to check it. He opened his door but he found nothing. He didn't see any shoes outside. He was going to go back but then the door beside his room opened. A tall man with a woman walked outside. They dressed well. Hokuto saw a bit of them and recognized that the man looked pretty cool. He had gray-ash hair and a necklace. He looked a bit tiny. The girl also looked cute. She wore a long white sweater and a long skirt creamy color with a cute hat. She smiled to the man and wrapped her hand around his arms then they walked outside.Â </p><p>"A couple?" Hokuto's eyebrows furrowed. He shook his head as he realized that it had nothing to do with him. He went inside his room. He walked back to his desk and did his work for hours before he visited Hayato and Michi this afternoon.Â Â </p><p>Â </p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto used to visit his little brother once a month. If he got busier, he couldn't visit him for months. But since he moved, visiting Hayato had been his weekly routine. And this time, there was something different when he visited him. He wouldn't be alone there like he used to. Michi would come with him, like this time.Â </p><p>Michi was already there, standing alone while crossing his fingers. He had always come first and waited for Hokuto in front of Hayato's gravestone. He always touched the gravestone and smiled at it as if he could see Hayato, causing a warm feeling inside Hokuto, yet broke his heart too because he wished Hayato would still be there with them.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"How's your new place, Hoku-nii?" Michi asked while walking to the road side, leaving Hayato's grave.</p><p>"Bad. So bad. There's a couple living besides my room and they're so noisy." Hokuto said as he massaged his and let out a long sigh.Â </p><p>"Really?!" Michi looked surprised by his words.Â </p><p>"Hmmm. Maybe you have to bring your girlfriend too. So you guys can have a competition." Michi suggested as he laughed.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Somehow, Hokuto wanted to slap Michi because of how annoying he could be. He reached his arms around Michi's neck, clamping him and cursing him.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Ouch!!"</p><p>Hokuto let his arms go. He looked wondering why Michi held his own neck that wrapped in the blue scarf that he gave him a month ago. Worries started growing inside him as he heard Michi hissed.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"......Are you alright?"</p><p>Â </p><p>".... Was I too hard?"Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"...Eh?....... Ah. No noâ€¦â€¦" Michi said as he waved his hands.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"...Ummm .... Iâ€¦.. I was in a fight with my friends, ehee." He continued while giving a smile, but Hokuto knew it was a fake smile.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto didn't say anything. HeÂ  gave him a suspicious look, staring at Michi's neck as his mind wandered about something. He knew Michi wasn't a bad kid. He wouldn't want to get involved in a fight.</p><p>Â </p><p>So what happened this time?</p><p>Â </p><p>Why did he get involved in a fight?</p><p>Â </p><p>What did his friends do?</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto wanted to ignore it like he used to do but he couldn't. He could feel something.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>A dishonesty.</p><p>Â </p><p>Michi had buried his face on his scarf as he felt like Hokuto had been glared at him. He had tried to act normally by humming or changing the topic but he became shuttered instead. Hokuto's eyebrows furrowed as he glared at Michi this time.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Michiâ€¦ "</p><p>Â </p><p>"..... Tell me the truthâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto saw how tight Michi held his scarf, burying himself more on it.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Michiâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"...You don't want to tell me?" Hokuto asked softly.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"I won't force you if you don't want to. But I'm worried about you. I don't think you would involve in a fight with your fri-.... "</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto swallowed hard his words as he saw Mochi pull off his scarf slowly, exposing his bruise on his left side neck.Â </p><p>Hokuto's eyes and mouth widened. He couldn't believe what he had seen. The bruise was so dark and big. The wound in the center of it seemed a bit deep. Hokuto was lost in words as his fingers touched it.</p><p>Â </p><p>"W-whâ€¦ What happened, Michi?"</p><p>Â </p><p>Michi held his words as his lips made a thin line. Tears falling down on his cheeks.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"... My fatherâ€¦. hit meâ€¦ "Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto felt like he got punched. He didn't expect this thing would also happen to Michi. His breath had become short, his blood was boiling inside him. Anger had started spreading in his whole body.Â </p><p>"And you didn't want to tell me this?!!" Hokuto didn't realize he had raised his voice.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"W-why?! Why did he hit you?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Did your mom know about it?"</p><p>Â </p><p>"Did he hit her too?!"Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He had attacked Michi with a bunch of questions, but he didn't get any answers. Michi was in silence. He brought his face down, scratching his fingers on his scarf in his hands.</p><p>Â </p><p>Hokuto stood up as he wanted to leave him alone, but Michi pulled his coat, stopping his step. Hokuto faced Michi and saw his face turned into red and tears pooling in his eyes.</p><p>Â </p><p>"Please don't leave meâ€¦ "</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Don't tell anyoneâ€¦"</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>"Iâ€¦ I was alone at home, searching for food. Thenâ€¦ then he came and pulled my hair and hit me. Heâ€¦" Michi couldn't say his next words as he sobbed. Hokuto clenched his jaw, pulling Michi on his arms, hugging him as he held his anger. He could feel Michi was trembling. Seeing Michi like this was just adding more pain to Hokuto. He hated to see this thing again. He hated the fact that he had to face this situation again . He could just ignore it but he couldn't. He wanted to leave this boy, but he couldn't. Michi was no one for him, they didn't related by blood. But he couldn't leave him. He couldn't ignore him. What if it got worse? What if something worse might happen? He didn't want it. He never wanted it anymore. He even had promised at that time.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He had promised to himself to protect this boy.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He had promised to himself to do anything to make this boy safe.</p><p>Â </p><p>He had promised to himself that he would never leave him.</p><p>Â </p><p>He had promised to himself he wouldn't let him make the same mistake like his old self.</p><p>Â </p><p>It was enough with Hayato, he wouldn't let Michi feel what Hayato felt.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>He would never do that.</p><hr/>
