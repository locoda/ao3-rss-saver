<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello! Welcome to my first ever attempt on bringing together two things that I love: The Untamed and SixTONES. Some readers might not be familiar with one of them and I hope they can still get to enjoy reading this fic</p><p>I have been experimenting with writing a different dynamic and I thought why not try to explore writing with Yizhan as one of the main characters? In this fic, I have two of my favorite ships: <a href="https://youtu.be/NOJSBUwDDq0?si=exVCPPpHAkHeG6I6" rel="nofollow">Wang Yibo x Xiao Zhan</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/UKQ_wSc4Bfk?si=mJy2lBYSPahCtTzS" rel="nofollow">Kyomoto Taiga x Tanaka Juri</a></p><p>I know I have some pending works lying around in my folders but I am a mood writer so I work on whichever one I feel like working on.</p><p>Well, enough babbling and let's get on with the fic!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Absolutely fucking not!” Taiga raised his voice and gripped his utensils harder than necessary.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Taiga, dear, language,” Yuumi, Taiga’s mother, gently said him. “We’re in front of food.” She kept lifted up her gaze to her son.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taiga sighed and shook his head. “Yet father chose this timing to tell us about getting Xiao Zhan into an arranged marriage.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I just thought now is as good a time as any,” Hiroki calmly said. Despite the sudden violent reaction from Taiga, the head of the Kyomoto family kept his composure. “Xiao Zhan, you know that I am only doing this for the good of the company, right?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I understand, uncle.” Xiao Zhan looked up from his plate and gently wiped his mouth with his napkin. Unlike Taiga, he was handling the situation much calmer. The sudden announcement blindsided him too but it was something that would happen sooner or later.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How can you keep calm about this,” Taiga faced his side, attention focused on his cousin. “We’re talking about <em> your </em>marriage. To someone you don’t know.” His attention was focused on Xiao Zhan.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan looked at his cousin seated on his side. Taiga’s pretty face was in contrast to his bad mood. “I know.” He smiled reassuringly. He reached out to rub his hand on Taiga’s shoulder, willing the other to calm down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yuumi or Hiroki could have easily manipulated their moods by influencing them with their pheromones but the two have never resorted to that. No matter how bad Taiga’s temper got or when Xiao Zhan stubbornly refuses to prioritize finding a mate over doj g design work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should,” Hiroki said. “The moment you chose to focus on art. You already made a decision for yourself.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His dinner long forgotten, Taiga turned to face his father. “Father,” Taiga calmed down his tone. “Xiao Zhan has been in our care since both of his parents died. Do you really think they would be supportive about this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am just protecting the business they built from their hard work, son. I believe the Xiaos would rather keep the business within the family. Xiao Zhan does not have the educational background to run the company as the president.” He bluntly said. “People are vultures when it comes to business. They’ll go after any weakness Xiao Zhan might have and attack him to take control of the company.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And a Wang child six years younger than him has what it takes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do not underestimate the Wangs, my child. The moment they turn eighteen, they already get trained to run a company. Wang Yibo might be years younger than Xiao Zhan, but he has more experience in running a business than your cousin.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know you only have my best interest at heart, uncle.” Xiao Zhan spoke before Taiga could utter another protest. He wanted the tension out of the air. He knew how fast Taiga’s mind works to find arguments when something ticks him off. This topic, for Xiao Zhan, was not something to really make a big deal out of. “If I may ask, will I have time to think about this?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Hiroki nodded. “I had the housemaid place his file on your study so you can read up on his basic information. But yes, I will give you time to think about this and to get to know him before making a decision. As much as the Wangs will be a powerful family partner, I still would want you to be with someone you could get along with.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, uncle.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yuumi decided to switch the topic over to the latest drama that she watched. It was sort of a bonding topic between her and her son, somewhere along the time they adopted Xiao Zhan, he too was roped into watching a drama episode or more whenever Yuumi got the chance to spend some time with them. With Hiroki, they mostly dealt with things related to work and business while Yuumi loved to spoil the cousins with anything related to rest and recreation.</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">Eight years ago, an accident took the lives of Xiao Zhan’s parents, leaving him an orphan. Although the Kyomotos were distant relatives of the Xiaos, Hiroki was Xiao Shiong’s best friend. The two had an agreement that if anything were to happen to any of them, the other would take care of the other’s family and business. Xiao Zhan was taken under the custody of the Kyomotos when the last will and testament of the Xiaos were read.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Since Xiao Zhan was not well adept with the Japanese language when he first moved to Japan, Taiga was asked by his parents to help him out with the language and get him adapted to living in Japan. As an only child, Taiga was happy with the arrangement, to finally have someone that resembled a sibling for him. The two easily got comfortable with each other, leaving the Kyomotos at ease with Xiao Zhan’s new life. It was a relief that despite the difference in their temperament, the two omegas grew up close as though they were real siblings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan was given the same treatment as Taiga. Truly being treated as though he was really their child. He used to spend some school breaks with the Kyomotos, which already made them aware of Xiao Zhan’s attitude and temperament. When he was adopted, Yuumi always chuckled at him when he tried to be more polite. The Kyomotos always reminded him to act the same as he did before, nothing should change about him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan has always loved making art. When his parents were alive, he already had a talk with them about wanting to stay a designer of their family’s clothing business instead of the one taking over his father’s position as the company chairman. He was vocal about it too when he had a talk with Hiroki about his university studies arrangement. That’s why it was no longer surprising for him that he would have to go through the arranged marriage path sooner or later. Xiao Zhan also had a strong desire to keep his parent’s business within the family and he knew the only way he could have both was to agree to an arranged marriage.</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">“I knew I’d find you here,” Taiga said as he took a seat on the bench in their garden.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The enclosed garden at the back of the mansion was filled with various types of flowers that Yuumi took care of. Yuumi was a very hands-on mother to Taiga and Xiao Zhan but when both reached the age where they no longer needed that much attention from her, she started growing her own garden to have something to spend her time on. Over time, the garden had also been Xiao Zhan’s sanctuary. It was the place that calmed him down the most.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan had set up his easel and a stool. Half of his canvas had painted flowers on it, resembling what was in the garden. “I’m about to pack up since it’s getting dark. I don’t want to mess up my colors.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you really think about this arranged marriage thing?” Taiga had always been blunt when it was only the two of them. He could also easily read Xiao Zhan, he knew when something was bothering the older one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t get anything past you.” Xiao Zhan nervously chuckled. “I already knew I’d have to agree to an arranged marriage sooner or later. Because I did not want to give up art.” He kept his gaze on his canvass, afraid that meeting Taiga’s eyes will only fuel the younger’s questioning.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t you want to be in love with the person you would be spending the rest of your life with? Don’t you want to be mated to someone you have a connection with? Xiao Zhan, we are so much more than just heirs of companies.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Bold of you to say that when you gave up theatre to focus on the family business. Besides, what if I fall in love with the person I’m arranged to get married with? What if that Wang boy is a really good alpha to me? Hasn’t that thought occurred to you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It seems that it occurred to you. That’s why you’re out here painting. Father did say he would give you time to get to know the other party first.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan nodded. “I’ve heard good things about the Wang family but I also heard they could get pretty competitive about having a spot in the family business. Maybe that Wang Yibo needs me as much as I need him. Let’s get to know him first.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If that is what you have decided on. But I would also like to meet him and maybe chaperone you a few times.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m pretty sure he speaks Chinese and his file also mentioned he can speak Japanese. I think I can communicate with him quite well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“That reminds me, I need to check his file. Let me borrow it tomorrow.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan let out a hearty laugh. “Who really is the older one here?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Taiga clicked his tongue. “Just let me do this, okay?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan stared at his ceiling, sleep was not really coming to him with the flood of thoughts swimming in his head. His parents. The Kyomotos. The business. He knew he had an obligation to all of them. At twenty-eight, it’s no longer even valid to say that he was being thrown to his responsibilities at such a young age. He had enough understanding of how to run a company, with the times he spent with Taiga and Hiroki while the younger was undergoing training. But still, he knew it was not enough. Especially since he did not really give it as much focus as he did with art and designing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan had heard countless praises when it came to his art. Still, it’s different when you’re vying to be the chairman of a company. Having a look at Wang Yibo’s file, even he admits that Yibo would be a better choice than him to run a company. The alpha did not look so bad in his picture too and Xiao Zhan wondered if he was just as intimidating as he was in his picture.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan wondered if Wang Yibo received a file about him as well. How did the alpha react to the news of them possibly being mates? What could have been the alpha's reaction to his file? The more he thought about it, the more questions popped into his head.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Xiao Zhan picked up the rabbit plushie from the headboard of his bed. He settled it on his chest, holding both of its short little arms. “I hope he doesn’t mind having plushies inside the room.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“We can still back out from this,” Taiga had half his body laid down on Xiao Zhan’s bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Xiao Zhan chuckled as he folded his clothes. It has been three days since they were told about the arranged marriage for Xiao Zhan. Taiga had not said a word about it since that night so Xiao Zhan assumed that Taiga had made peace with it over the couple of days. It was not like Xiao Zhan was not losing sleep since they were told about his arranged marriage. He still found himself tossing and turning in bed thinking about what ifs in his mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What if the alpha doesn’t like him physically and his personality? What if the alpha was a snob? What if the alpha was actually in love with someone but would have to be his mate due to their filial duties? And a lot more questions that leave his mind in turmoil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Xiao Zhan was not so sure about him liking the alpha on the get-go as well but his case was different. He had long made peace about arranged marriages. Wang Yibo on the other hand, Xiao Zhan has no idea if he had ever thought about arranged marriages in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you even finished packing yet? I still don’t know how much clothes would I actually be needing.” Xiao Zhan diverted the topic. In front of him were two suitcases filled with clothes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not like we can’t go back here to get some stuff. I bet mom wouldn’t even complain if we ask her to bring us some stuff over there.” Taiga let out a sigh. “Why are you dodging my question?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because, Taiga, I am here packing my stuff. Doesn’t that pretty much answer your question?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Xiao Zhan stood in front of his wardrobe, pulling and placing back one piece of clothing after another. He was undecided which ones to bring with him for the first few days of his stay at the hotel. Taiga did have a point, they can just come back here any time to get a different set of clothes. Still, with a desire to make a good first impression, Xiao Zhan wanted to be dressed well for the days he would be spending with Wang Yibo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have a separate suitcase for your art materials?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not like I’ll literally spend all day with Wang Yibo. I still need to do work and of course have something I could spend my time on when I’m alone. I’m pretty sure that Yibo has work too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga scoffed. “Already calling him by his given name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, instead of grilling me here, you should get started on packing too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m already done. Unlike you, I don’t need to make that good of an impression. If you do marry into their family, doing business with them will be smoother for me regardless of how they remember how I dress.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Taiga,” Xiao Zhan had another thought that was keeping him up at night. He knew how Taiga felt about all this but he could not find the right words to confront his cousin. After all, Taiga was only thinking about his well-being. “Don’t be so hostile with Wang Yibo if you’re really determined to chaperone on some days.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to worry about that. So long as he doesn’t hurt you, I’ll be on my best behavior. He is still a Wang after all. I wouldn’t want to make an enemy of a family that’s quite a name in the business world.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hiroki was always a man of his word. He said that Xiao Zhan would be given some time to get to know Wang Yibo before their engagement was formalized. With that being said, they extended an invitation to the Wangs to spend a month at one of their hotels. Taiga and Xiao Zhan would also be staying over at the hotel during the duration of the Wangs stay as well. As much as arranged marriages were on the traditional side, they wanted to give more privacy between Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo to get to know each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The Wangs accepted the invitation. The two families were set to have dinner to break the ice between them before anything else. The Wangs were predominantly an alpha household, a good match for their family or so Hiroko said while they waited for their guest to arrive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The private room was big enough to host both families with four members present for each. The Wangs brought a distant relative with them. Platters of side dishes were in the middle of the table, atop the rotating part of it while the main dish each person ordered were served to them on individual plates. There was no need to even have a brief introduction, the families were quite familiar with each other after having met in different social functions in the past.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The dinner went well. The two families talked briefly about the arranged marriage, with Hiroki insisting that Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo get to know each other first. Hiroki made it clear to the Wangs that nothing was set in stone quite yet, that they were still just one of the prospect family. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wang Ziqi - Wang Yibo’s father - agreed with what the Kyomotos wanted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Talks about business did not start until dessert was served. The three families had different markets. The Kyomotos were focused on hotels, apartment complexes, and resorts. The Xiaos were heavily focused on traditional clothing but are looking into tapping other markets. While the Wangs were focused on automotive and shopping mall chains.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If Yibo and Xiao Zhan gets along well, Yibo’s background with shopping malls will be really helpful with the clothing line.” Hiroki commented. “Xiao Zhan, Taiga. Why don’t the two of you show Yibo and Juri around the hotel and the amenities available? After all, the four of you will be staying here for a month. Might as well get acquainted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you’ll excuse us,” Xiao Zhan politely bowed to the Wangs before they made their way out of the private room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wang Yibo and Tanaka Juri. Both alphas.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the days leading up to tonight, Taiga did his own search about the Wangs which he shared with Xiao Zhan. There he found that Wang Yibo really did start his training young, even younger than some of his cousins. At the age of sixteen, Yibo was already learning the ropes of how to handle a business. Despite only being twenty-two and a graduating student, Wang Yibo did have experience under his belt. Aside from business, Taiga found that Yibo was interested in racing as well. Nothing illegal which gave Taiga mixed emotions - he was happy Xiao Zhan would not be dealing with someone entangled in illegal activities yet he felt a little sad that he found nothing negative on Wang Yibo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Wang Yibo was not introduced to them thru an arranged marriage situation, Taiga admitted that the boy was not such a bad candidate for Xiao Zhan’s husband.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Tanaka Juri is a distant relative of the Wangs. Just like Taiga and Xiao Zhan, Juri and Yibo grew up close to each other. Despite the invitation to stay at the hotel only being extended to the Wangs, Yibo requested to bring his cousin along with him when it was mentioned that Xiao Zhan would also be bringing his cousin on the month-long stay. Just like Yibo, Taiga found nothing negative about Juri.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo walked side by side with Taiga and Juri walking a few feet behind them, far enough to give the other two some privacy to talk to each other. With them walking side by side, Xiao Zhan noticed the difference in their height. Wang Yibo was a few centimeters shorter than him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Xiao Zhan led their group to the outdoor bar beside the infinity pool area. Lucky for them, there were a few available tables they could occupy. Xiao Zhan and Yibo chose the table beside the glass balcony railing while Taiga and Juri sat three tables away from them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A long island iced tea for me, please.” Xiao Zhan said as a waitress took their order.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whiskey on the rocks for me,” Having been silent since they left the private dining room, Yibo finally spoke. His voice was deeper than Xiao Zhan’s. After placing their order, Yibo simply stared at Xiao Zhan, as if the alpha was memorizing his features.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, did you want to go somewhere else? There’s a casino, an arcade, a karaoke, and an indoor bar here as well.” Xiao Zhan asked, trying to read the younger’s reaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yibo shook his head. “Here’s better. We can talk with less distractions.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Xiao Zhan was nervous. He normally could read other people well even on the first meeting, but right now, Wang Yibo seemed a little guarded it was hard for him to read the younger. Although he was not feeling any hostility from the other party so he could say that the night is going fairly well. “Sorry, I’m not really good at this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At what? Arranged marriages?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t even a joke but Xiao Zhan could not help but laugh at what Yibo said. “Sorry, sorry,” he waved his hand in apology. “You might have gotten the wrong idea with uncle saying you’re just one of the potential marriage partner but I assure you, you’re the first one I met up with and I won’t be meeting with anyone else while we get to know each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds fair,” Yibo nodded his head. “You don’t have to worry too. I’m not currently dating anyone and I don’t plan on meeting anyone while getting to know you too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That makes it sound like we’re exclusively dating.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t mind exclusively dating a pretty boy like you,” Yibo said in a straightforward way that rendered Xiao Zhan speechless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The instant unexpected response made his face flush. Xiao Zhan knew Yibo noticed his blush with the way the younger’s lips tugged up in a smirk. Thankfully, their drinks were served, giving Xiao Zhan a moment to collect his thoughts. He has been complimented about his looks before but somehow hearing it come from Yibo was a whole different feeling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you mind if I call you Zhan-ge?” Yibo asked when the waitress has left them alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure. If you’re comfortable with that. Can I call you Yibo then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yibo nodded before drinking a bit of his whiskey. Yibo lifted his gaze back to Xiao Zhan. “Ge, you can ask me anything and I’ll answer you with nothing but honesty. I understand you want to be sure of me because omegas can only be mated once, there’s a lot on the line for you here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Yibo.” Hearing the alpha say that he would be nothing but honest to him lifted some of Xiao Zhan’s worries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the night progressed, the two continued to talk. At first, it was mostly Xiao Zhan that did most of the questioning with Yibo giving him direct answers before directing the same question back to Xiao Zhan. Their conversation flowed smoothly. This made Xiao Zhan a little bit more relieved, his worries from the past days faded a little whenever he got the alpha to laugh a little.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to worry that much. My cousin is a good alpha.” Juri broke the silence between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course you’d say that. He’s your cousin.” Taiga finally put his phone down and faces Juri. “Don’t worry. I’m not plotting to sabotage him. At least not yet. I’ll only make a move if he hurts my cousin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Juri raised his eyebrow. “You’re feisty for a pretty omega.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why? You expect me to bow down just because you’re an alpha?” Taiga leaned back and crossed his arms. He looked straight at Juri. “You can leave and go back to your room if you’re not worried about your cousin messing up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now why would I go back to my room and spend the night alone when I can have a few drinks with a pretty boy with me?” Juri’s lips tugged up into a smirk before he picked up his drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do what you want.”</span>

<p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan woke up feeling refreshed. Staring at the ceiling of his hotel room, he stretched out his limbs. After days of tossing and turning in bed, he finally had a good night’s rest last night. Knowing his low tolerance for alcohol, Xiao Zhan did not drink that much with Yibo last night. They instead ordered some finger food as they continued to talk. Jumping from one topic to another without any direction of where the conversation was going.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan was pleasantly surprised that they hit it off last night. At first, Yibo was just giving him short, straight answers which worried him a little that he might be boring the alpha to death with his questions. But when they got to the topic of Yibo’s hobbies, the alpha’s eyes lit up and he talked a little more enthusiastically.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The silence between them as Yibo walked him back to his room was comfortable. It was pretty late when they decided to call it a night and not much people were seen around the lobby nor the hallways anymore. Xiao Zhan did not even mind that their hands kept brushing into each other as they walked down the hallway. Their rooms were on different floors but the alpha insisted that he walked the omega to his room. They had a simple exchange of good nights and see yous but still, Xiao Zhan could not fight off his smile once he was inside his room.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan could feel his face flush as he thought about Yibo. He pulled up his duvet as if he was hiding his flush from someone in the room. He was admittedly physically attracted to the alpha. There was no use denying it. Seeing the alpha’s form, he was surprised he did not drool on the spot. He already thought he looked good in his picture but seeing the alpha in person still knocked his breath away. Yibo’s scent was a mix of sandalwood and patchouli, Xiao Zhan was only able to identify it when they were walking back to his room.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>As for his personality, Xiao Zhan does not want to jump to conclusions just yet. While the conversation flowed smoothly, he had some apprehensions since he wanted to make a good impression, maybe the alpha was being polite to make a good impression as well. Xiao Zhan worried about it a little but they do have a month to get to know each other better.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>With his apparent attraction to the alpha, Xiao Zhan hoped that he left the alpha having some thoughts about him too. Xiao Zhan had been complimented for his looks before so he was pretty confident in that department. Despite the many topics they talked about, they did not touch on each other’s preferences so that was a gray area.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan’s train of thought was interrupted when there was light knocking on his door. Picking up his robe from where he left it last night, Xiao Zhan made sure to fasten the belt around him before answering the door. Whoever was on the other side did not seem like they were in a hurry as they only knocked once and did not try again.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The sight that greeted him made Xiao Zhan swallow a lump of air. He was just having thoughts about Yibo earlier but here he was now in the flesh, in his gym clothes. Xiao Zhan opened his mouth to greet him but the sight of Yibo's arms made his brain malfunction.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Uhm, is this a bad time? Did I wake you?" Yibo scratched the back of his neck and the stretch of his arm distracted Xiao Zhan even more.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan shook his head. "Do you want to come in?" He moved a little to the side to make space for the alpha to come in.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo was scratching his neck as he entered the room. The alpha seemed nervous about something. "Uhm, I forgot to ask you for your number last night. And… I wanted to ask if you want to grab lunch so I dropped by."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Oh, right. Phone numbers. Let me go grab my phone." Xiao Zhan could feel Yibo's eyes on him. So what if he bent down a little more than necessary to accentuate his ass while picking up his phone? Yibo was in his room in all his gym clothes glory anyway and Xiao Zhan just thought that two could play this game.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan saw how quickly Yibo turned his head when he turned around to face him, probably to not get caught ogling which meant his little show was a success.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Here," Xiao Zhan handed Yibo his phone. "You can key in your number."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Ah," Yibo pulled out his phone from the strap around his forearm and handed it to Xiao Zhan. "Can you save yours too?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>They both saved each other's contact before giving back the other's phone.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"So, uhm, lunch?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Ah! Right. I was here to ask you to lunch," Yibo nervously chuckled as he scratched his head again. "Do you want to or do you have plans?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I don’t have plans today.” Xiao Zhan said with a smile in hopes of defusing some of the tension.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo’s eyes seemed to light up after hearing the omega was free for the day. “I need to wash off the gym sweat and get fresh clothes first. Uhm, is an hour enough for you to get ready?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo could have easily said it as a command but Xiao Zhan appreciated that the alpha posed a question instead.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I think so. But, you can message me when you’re done so you won’t have to wait outside my door. I’ll reply when I’m ready.”</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re not going to be tailing your cousin today?” Juri took the empty seat beside Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga sat at the far end corner of the outside bar. The weather was fine this afternoon and he thought about doing some work while observing around some of the amenities of the hotel. Xiao Zhan had sent him a message about going to lunch with Yibo. As much as he wanted to come with them or spy on them, he knew it would defeat the purpose of the two getting to know each other.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You were the one who smugly said I did not have to worry about your cousin.” Taiga kept his focus on the iPad in front of him, looking through new season glassware that might suit the outside bar.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Not even sparing me a glance,” Juri called over the waiter. “A strawberry-banana smoothie, please.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga sighed deeply when he felt Juri’s gaze was back to him. “Please just go bother someone else.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“If you’re thinking about changing the glassware, wouldn’t it be better to be in tandem with releasing new drinks? Consult with your bartenders here for it.” Juri suggested, his gaze never leaving Taiga’s face.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga thought about what Juri said. He picked up their current drink menu. “Your suggestion makes sense,” pulling up the calendar app from his iPad, he still did not spare a glance at Juri and instead checked his availability. “I should talk with all the bartenders soon.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re welcome.” The hint of sarcasm in Juri’s tone was evident enough for someone observant.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Do you undergo training to take over the family business too?” Taiga turned a little to face Juri.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Juri shook his head. “The competition’s tough enough with the main family. I’d rather focus on sales and PR, be a support to Yibo or something.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“So if you’re cousin marries into our family, you’ll follow him over to support in managing the Xiao’s business?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I would.” Juri gave a straightforward answer. “If he says he wants to build his own company from the ground up, I would also support him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga could see how sincere Juri was with his words. “You have that much trust in Wang Yibo?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I do. He’s the only one who had ever treated me as family. Even my own siblings are too caught up with beating each other for a place in the company that they lose sight of other things. Yibo’s different. Although he excels just as much as the others, he doesn’t let it be his whole life. I don’t know if I’m making sense now. Just, Yibo puts his utmost effort in whatever he puts his mind into so I trust his decisions.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I kind of get it,” Taiga said. “Maybe, in a way, he and Xiao Zhan might complement each other. That is if things work out between them.” Taiga shrugged his shoulder. “Xiao Zhan is laser focused when he has a goal in mind but he knows when to take a breather. Maybe he can balance out your cousin.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Juri chuckled at what Taiga had said. “Just when I thought you were starting to be gentler, you say something like that. How about you? Are you vying to be the next Kyomoto chairman?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“This hotel,” Taiga gazed over at the main building. “This is actually mine. I spearheaded this project to prove to my parents that they don’t need to worry even if I don’t become the next chairman. Let’s face it, no matter how good I am, there will still be some bias because I’m an omega. It pisses me off but it’s the society we move in.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“So, what? You’ll be in an arranged marriage like Xiao Zhan?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga shrugged his shoulders. “My parents never mentioned it. But maybe after they saw how I reacted to Xiao Zhan’s, they might rethink things about arranged marriages.”</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo took Xiao Zhan to a Chinese restaurant at the heart of the city. Being both Chinese, the two communicated in their native language through lunch. Xiao Zhan was a bit out of practice with speaking Chinese as he already gotten used to using Japanese as his main language for the past eight years. Yibo was more than willing to assist him when he could not say something in Chinese. In turn, Xiao Zhan gave Yibo a few Japanese-speaking tips as well.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo had booked them a private dining room which Xiao Zhan was thankful for. They could freely talk about anything without worrying that someone might overhear them. The conversation between them flowed as smoothly as it did last night. Now though, they seemed more relaxed. Or at least that’s how Xiao Zhan felt about it. When they finally finished their food and asked for the bill, Yibo pulled out his card before Xiao Zhan could even peek at how much their total was.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Hey, I’ll wire you half of the bill,” Xiao Zhan pulled out his phone but Yibo placed his hand over the screen.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I was the one who asked you for lunch. It’s my treat.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan pouted at his defeat.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Don’t act cute,” Yibo lightly chuckled. “My heart might not be able to take it.” he placed his right hand on his chest for emphasis.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Wang Yibo!” Xiao Zhan pressed his hands on his cheeks, repeating the gesture gently. “You really know how to fluster someone.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Do you have any plans this afternoon?” Xiao Zhan responded with a shake of his head which made Yibo smile. “Do you want to have a walk with me? We can go shopping or whatever since there’s a lot of shops around here.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Sure. Let’s take a walk around and maybe just decide on what to do along the way?” Xiao Zhan suggested. Shopping was not really on his mind right now but he did want to spend a little more time with Yibo. Especially knowing that tomorrow will be another weekday and they would both probably be busy with their own work.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The weather was nice enough to walk around outside - it was not too hot nor too cold and the clouds were covering the sun enough for it to not be too strong. They walked side by side, keeping close to each other as there were a lot of people walking around this Sunday afternoon. Their hands kept brushing against each other as they walked.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan took a bold move and entwined his fingers to Yibo’s. He noticed the alpha stiffen at the gesture and Xiao Zhan was about to pull off his hand thinking he might have overstepped or something but just as he was about to pull off, Yibo entwined his fingers with his.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Almost in sync, the two turned to look at each other. Unable to fight the urge to smile, they smiled warmly at each other as they felt their hold on each other’s hand tighten.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Along the way, they found a park that had a few empty benches. The two decided to take a rest there for a bit before heading back to the hotel. The sun was starting to set but there were still a few kids running around and playing with each other, their laughs being heard around the park.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Would you like to have some ice cream?” Yibo pointed over at the ice cream truck on the other end of the park.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan nodded his head. “I’d like one in a cone. Feel free to choose a flavor for me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Alright. But don’t blame me if you won’t like it.” Yibo gently squeezed his hand before letting go.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan watched Yibo as he walked towards the ice cream truck. A few kids here and there almost ran into Yibo but the alpha was observant enough to make way when a kid was about to hit him. Once Yibo was in front of the ice, Xiao Zhan could not help but chuckle at the sight. Yibo was towering over the little kids who were lining up for ice cream. Whenever the alpha noticed that there was a kid behind him, he let the kid go in front of him in line, which made his wait for his turn longer than necessary.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan, despite paying close attention to Yibo, did not miss how the attention of some of the people in the park was caught by the alpha. Xiao Zhan could see a couple of girls whispering to each other while glancing over at the alpha. Visible disappointment was seen in some of the people paying attention to the alpha when Yibo walked away from the ice cream truck with two ice cream cones at hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I got mint chocolate chip and vanilla,” Yibo pushed both ice cream cones in front of Xiao Zhan. “Which one would you like?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“The vanilla one. I’m not a fan of mint chocolate chip,” Xiao Zhan reached for the vanilla ice cream. “Thank you for this.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Silence enveloped them as they ate their ice cream while watching the visible sunset from where they were seated. Xiao Zhan had only met Yibo last night but the silence between them did not bother him, he felt at ease with not scrambling his brain for a topic to avoid an awkward silence between them. Somehow, sitting side by side without any words exchanged between them was comfortable.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan turned his attention over to Yibo. The alpha looked at ease by his side as well. Yibo noticed that Xiao Zhan was gazing at him this time instead of the sunset, the alpha looked over at Xiao Zhan. Their eyes met and a smile spread on their faces almost at the same time.</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>The sight that greeted Xiao Zhan and Yibo when they got back to the hotel was surprising, to say the least. Juri and Taiga were in the hotel lobby with their laptops on. The two looked as if they were discussing something but because of the distance, Xiao Zhan and Yibo could not exactly hear what they were talking about.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Well color me surprised,” Xiao Zhan said as he was guided by Yibo to sit in the chair opposite Taiga’s. “Did you two hit it off or something?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga rolled his eyes at the statement. “Juri had some good ideas so I was just discussing them with him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I see. First name basis then,” There was a hint of teasing in Xiao Zhan’s voice which earned him a chuckle from the two alphas and a groan from Taiga. “I apologize that my cousin made you work on a Sunday. He’s usually much more of an exciting company than this, Tanaka-san.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Oh, please, we might be family soon so you can call me Juri.” Juri said. “Taiga wasn’t such a bad company. I didn’t have plans today anyway.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Have you two had dinner yet? Or would you like to join us?” Xiao Zhan looked between Juri and Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Let me just wrap up these notes, okay?” Taiga said.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>At dinner, Taiga sat beside Xiao Zhan while Yibo sat in front of him. The four of them conversed about random topics as they ate. Xiao Zhan noticed that Taiga was not engaging much in the conversation, probably still deep in thought about whatever it was that he and Juri were talking about earlier. Xiao Zhan did not miss how attentive Juri was to Taiga as they ate though, pushing a few things here and there to give Taiga enough space as he ate his dinner.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>When they finished, Yibo walked Xiao Zhan back to his hotel room. Ever since they held hands for the first time this afternoon, the two seemed to have it as a reflex reaction to hold each other’s hand when they walked side by side.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I had a good time with you today,” Xiao Zhan said as he stopped in front of his door, not letting go of Yibo’s hand just yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo took Xiao Zhan’s other free hand in his. “I had a good time today too,” he looked Xiao Zhan squarely in the eyes. “I know you’ll be busy with work during weekdays but feel free to message me if we can meet up after work or not.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan nodded. “Just be honest with me if you can’t make it, okay? I wouldn’t want to deter you from work. You also have some classes left, right?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo nodded. “I’ll make time for you if I can,” Yibo moved his hand from holding Xiao Zhan’s hand to caressing his cheek. “Good night, Xiao Zhan.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan leaned into the touch. “Good night, Wang Yibo.”</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">Chapter 4</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">
<span>Just as Xiao Zhan and Yibo had expected, work had kept them pretty busy. They were able to sneak in a few messages to each other here and there when they found the time during work hours but mostly were just about what time they should meet up for dinner. Staying in the same hotel was a very convenient setup for them. It lessened the time they needed to take into consideration when meeting up, especially after knowing that Yibo’s place was on the other side of the city, almost an hour away from the Kyomotos residence where Xiao Zhan stayed.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The food at the hotel was not bad but they did not want to exhaust their easy-access dinner option by eating there every day especially since they had a month-long stay in the hotel. There were plenty of other restaurants around the vicinity, they were not exactly lacking options of where to get their meals. The more meals they had with each other, the more they got to know each other's taste. Xiao Zhan teased Yibo about not being able to handle the spicyness of his food while Yibo took note to only let Xiao Zhan taste his food but bit take a bite from his.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>On one particular Wednesday night, Xiao Zhan was suddenly struck by inspiration and continuously drew patterns for cloth designs while Yibo was busy with both his class requirements and some things he needed to take care of for work. The two decided to just order room service and ate at the Xiao Zhan’s hotel room.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>There was silence between the two of them as they worked. The sound of pencil meeting paper and the continuous tapping of a laptop’s keyboard was what filled the silence in the room. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan glanced over at Yibo when he finished yet another design. He rested his elbow on the table and cradled his head on his left hand as he watched the alpha work on something on his laptop. Xiao Zhan had noticed the strong features of Yibo from the first time they met yet he can not help but admire the alpha. Yibo was not the big built type of guy, he was lean and Xiao Zhan found himself wondering just how strong Yibo's arms were with the knowledge of the alpha working out in the gym thrice a week.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Is there something wrong, Zhange?” Yibo asked without raising his eyes from his laptop. “Do you need more food or something?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Actually, I feel pretty full." Xiao Zhan kept his eyes on Yibo.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange was so immersed in his drawing he didn’t even notice I was feeding him with his sushi,” Yibo said. “You shouldn’t be around people when you’re that concentrated on what you’re doing. Not without me there to protect you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Wang Yibo! You really know how to fluster someone, huh?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange, I’m sorry I’m not much of a company today. That’s one of the downsides of being a university student.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Hey, come on. I was pretty caught up with my designs too so I think we’re pretty much even tonight. I actually don’t mind that we’re doing our own thing. I like that I feel comfortable around your presence despite the silence and I hope you are too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo raised his look from his laptop towards Xiao Zhan, locking their eyes together. “Xiao Zhan, I’ll be more than willing to spend all my free time in your presence if that is what you wish. I don’t mind the silence. I don’t mind that we’re doing different things.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You should get back to what you’re doing. It’s getting late.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Does Zhange want to rest now?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan shook his head. “I have one more pattern in mind that I need to draw before I forget about it.” </span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga snapped his fingers in front of Xiao Zhan. “What has gotten you so deep in thought tonight?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The cousins were having dinner in a quaint Italian restaurant that had recently opened for business. They received an invite to eat at the restaurant for free as the owner is the son of one of Hiroki’s close friends. Since it was just near the hotel, they decided to try the food.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>It was another high end restaurant in the district. There was no strict dress code but most of the diners were dressed up, couples who enjoyed a quiet place to have their meal. The cousins were sat at a window seat at the far right corner of the restaurant. Not minding the people around them, they continued conversing through their meal. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“We haven’t really seen each other for almost two weeks, Xiao Zhan. Is something the matter? Did that Wang Yibo do something to you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan shook his head. “Sorry, Taiga. I’m trying to figure out the spices in these dishes. Maybe I can try cooking them sometimes.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Is that really it?” Taiga raised his eyebrow, not being convinced about what Xiao Zhan said. “Or is your mind occupied thinking about Wang Yibo now that he’ll be away for a couple of days? When will he be back again?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Monday. But he said he’ll go straight to his classes from the airport.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga nodded his head. “Just admit that you miss him already. Has he been good to you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“He has been really good to me.” Simply remembering some moments he shared with Yibo made Xiao Zhan’s face flushed. The other people around were minding their own business and he was only with Taiga at their table that he did nothing to even cover up his blush. “I might just be one of the lucky ones who agreed to an arranged marriage.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“We can’t be too sure about it yet,” Taiga said. “Of course, he will be good to you. He’s under trial. Has that never crossed your mind? That maybe Wang Yibo has only been good to you because you’re the Xiao heir? And maybe he’s just doing all this to be filial?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan fell silent. He avoided meeting Taiga’s eyes and kept his look down on the table. That thought did occur to him before. But every time he was with Yibo, all his worries seemed to get watered down. Being around Yibo made him feel at ease to the point that he sometimes forgot that they were being arranged to be married because he needed someone who could handle their company for him aside from having a mate and a husband. It was a scary thought: Yibo only being in it because he was a Xiao heir.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I’m sorry. That was out of line.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan sighed. “I know you, Taiga. You can really say and think such things. And I know you have my best interest at heart. I admit, I am afraid that Yibo might only be in it because I am a Xiao heir. But sometimes I would also like to think that he’s being honest with me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Has he ever done anything to control your emotions?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan shook his head. “He even tries to hide it with his clothes but I noticed he wears scent blockers sometimes when we’re alone in my hotel room together.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga cleared his throat. “I wouldn't want to instigate a misunderstanding while he’s too far to explain himself. Don’t think about it too much, Xiao Zhan. Just… thread carefully.”</span>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan and Yibo constantly communicated through texting while Yibo was taking care of some business in Beijing. Their constant communication eased Xiao Zhan’s worry somehow. Still, there was a part of him that hoped he and Yibo had met a different circumstance. Without the weight of being the Xiao heir. Xiao Zhan wondered if the alpha would be treating him the same way he treats him now if they were not arranged to be married</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<span>xz: You’re spending two more days there, right?</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<span>yb: That was the original plan.</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<span>xz: So there’s some changes? Have you contacted your uni about missing class?</span>
</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<span>yb: No. I want to go back earlier. I miss you.</span>

<p dir="ltr" align="justify">

</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
<span>yb: Get some rest, Zhange. Good night. I’ll see you soonest.</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan placed his phone on the nightstand. He pulled the blanket to cover him from head to toe. He never had a boyfriend before nor had he been pursued by anyone before Wang Yibo and he blames that for being easily flustered by Yibo’s words. He never felt his heart race over a text message before. The attraction was already there but Xiao Zhan wondered if he had already developed feelings this early.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<span>Sunday rolled in before Xiao Zhan could even notice the days go by. Yibo had messaged him last night that he would be busy for today and might not be able to reply to messages but encouraged Xiao Zhan to still leave some if he wanted to. Taiga was swamped with meetings for the day because this was the only day that majority of the hotel bar’s staff was available to talk about some possible changes they needed to do with the menu and service.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan had the day to himself but there was nothing that really appealed to him. In the end, he settled for working out in the gym in the morning and spending the rest of the day reading the book he had recently bought.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>If Taiga had not knocked on his door for dinner, Xiao Zhan would had skipped it completely as he eventually got immersed in his book. Since both of them were pre-occupied by other thoughts, they both resigned to their respective rooms right after they ate their dinner.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan checked his phone. There was still no message from Yibo. Even after he had taken his night shower and finished his whole skin care routine, there was still no message. Yibo did tell him that he would be busy today but still Xiao Zhan had a tiny bit of hope that Yibo would send him another message before the day ended.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Just as Xiao Zhan was about to go back to reading his book, there was a knock on his door. He wrapped himself with his bathrobe before he answered the door.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Yibo, what are you –”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan was not even able to finish his sentence. Yibo immediately wrapped him in an embrace. It was so sudden that Xiao Zhan stumbled back a little. Thankfully, Yibo was able to balance both of them to not hit the floor. With no one holding the door, it had closed on its own.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I missed you, Zhange.” Yibo tightened his embrace, resting his head on Xiao Zhan’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Well, this was unexpected,” Xiao Zhan lightly tapped on Yibo’s back. “Don’t break my bones, Yibo.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Sorry,” Yibo loosened his arm but kept them around Xiao Zhan’s waist. He looked at Xiao Zhan fondly before continuing to speak. “There’s something I want to tell you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan could see the determination in Yibo’s eyes. Whatever it was that he intended to say, it was clear from the alpha’s expression that he had thought it through. “What is it?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I want to start over,” Yibo said without breaking eye contact with Xiao Zhan. “I want to get to know you and spend time with you without the arrange marriage hanging above my head. I just want us to be –”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Just Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo.” Xiao Zhan finished Yibo’s sentence for him with a smile on his face. It felt like a weight was lifted off of his shoulder with what Yibo had said.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Yeah,” Relief was evident on Yibo’s face. He lifted one of his hands to cup Xiao Zhan’s face. “It’s not that we got off on the wrong foot. But… I just want to take a chance to woo you without people thinking I’m only doing it for the politics of it all. Xiao Zhan, let’s forget about our responsibilities to our families first, will that be okay with you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Of course, Yibo.” Xiao Zhan leaned in on Yibo’s touch. “You couldn’t wait another day to tell me that?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange, if I didn’t had to finish a contract signing I would have been here yesterday,” Yibo couldn’t fight back his yawn. “Fuck, sorry about that. I literally came to the airport after finishing work and went directly here. My luggage is in the hallway.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan chuckled as he pried himself off of Yibo’s hold. He opened the door and pulled in Yibo’s luggage. “You probably still have your essentials here. Do… do you want to stay over here tonight? You can wash up in the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Are you sure about this, Zhange?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan scratched the back of his head, turning away from Yibo’s gaze. “You can say no. It’s just that… I missed you too so I thought staying in one room for the night would not hurt.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Don’t worry, Zhange. I won’t do anything forceful to you.” Yibo said before he headed for the bathroom.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<span>Despite spending the night together being his idea, Xiao Zhan felt nervous when he could already hear the hair dryer. A hint that Yibo was about to finish getting ready for bed. He had never really spent a night with an alpha, just them in one room, he was not quite sure about how it would affect him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The bed dipped a little on Yibo’s weight when he joined Xiao Zhan. The alpha kept a space between the two of them before laying down.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange, can I hug you for a little bit? Just until one of us falls asleep.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan moved closer to Yibo instead of verbally answering. Yibo closed in the remaining distance and let Xiao Zhan rest his head on his chest.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re so warm,” Xiao Zhan slung his arm over Yibo. “Get some rest, Yibo.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Good night, Xiao Zhan.” Yibo planted a kiss on top of Xiao Zhan’s head before pulling the blanket over them.</span>

<p align="justify">
<span>“He really said that?” Taiga’s composure remained as Xiao Zhan told him about what Yibo said last night. “Wow. I mean, you must have really charmed him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Probably. But, I’m not being entirely honest with him. He has only ever seen me in this hotel. What if he doesn’t like my quirks?” Xiao Zhan fidgeted with the hem of his shirt.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga cradled his head with his left arm as he looked at his cousin. “Then we find another marriage proposal for you.” He was answered with an exasperated sigh and Taiga could not hold back his laughter. “You really like that Wang Yibo, don’t you? He’s already a marriage candidate. Just tell my father you approve of him already.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I don’t want it that way. I don’t want to force it on him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Xiao Zhan, did you listen to your own story earlier? I’m pretty sure Wang Yibo likes you too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan buried his face in his hands and groaned. “You know what? I’ll make a move. I’ll show him things about me. The earlier this ends, the less painful.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Taiga shook his head as he listened. “I don’t know what’s making you negative all of a sudden, that’s supposed to be me. I was pretty much against the whole arranged marriage thing but that Wang Yibo seemed to be trying to woo you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I’ll be convinced that you’re starting to like him if you stop calling him ‘that Wang Yibo’.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“So, what’s your plan?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan had a quick phone call with Yuumi after he got ready for the day he had planned for him and Yibo. He checked in with Yuumi if their kitchen at the mansion was currently stocked to know if he and Yibo would need to have a detour to the supermarket before heading straight to the mansion.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan does not have an extravagant plan for their weekend. As far as planning goes, he only had spending the weekend over at the Kyomotos mansion in mind and to really let Yibo get to know him more. Xiao Zhan could not think of a better way to know if Yibo would really like him other than to let him spend the weekend in a space he was comfortable with and show off his cooking skills before getting to his main event: the introduction of Wang Yibo to his collection of plushies.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Are you nervous?” Yibo said as he pulled over the parking lot. “Shouldn’t I be the one nervous? I’m meeting </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> foster family.” He chuckled, seemingly trying to lighten up the mood.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I’m pretty sure they will like you. Uncle already does, he was the one that chose you first.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo hummed while shaking his head. “I’ve done business with your uncle once. Maybe I left a good impression.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo carried the box of groceries they had bought before coming to the mansion. Although the kitchen was said to be fully stocked, there were a couple of snacks that Xiao Zhan wanted but was not sure if they had it at home.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan had the resolve of showing Yibo everything about him. At least everything he could fit in the weekend. So far, he has not scared off Yibo with the amount of snacks and tea he bought.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Once at the entrance, Yibo refused to give the box to the lady housekeepers and only bulged when the gardener was the one who offered to take it to the kitchen. When his hands were now free, Yibo took the paper bags from Xiao Zhan’s hands. Yibo asked Xiao Zhan beforehand what he should bring as gifts and despite Xiao Zhan’s refusal, Yibo brought some ginseng supplements and different scented lotions.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Uncle, Auntie,” Xiao Zhan greeted them as they entered the living room. “Yibo and I will be staying for the weekend.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Xiao Zhan,” Yummi stood up and hugged him. “This house is so lonely without you and Taiga.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“No one watches your shows with you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Your uncle’s no fun, all he does is complain about what happens,” Yuumi pouted. “I have something lined up for us and Yibo if we get the time this weekend.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“We’ll see,” Xiao Zhan said.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Mr and Mrs Kyomoto, thank you for having me,” Yibo bowed down and straightened up when he felt Yuumi’s hand on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Call me ‘auntie’ too. Zhanzhan wouldn’t have brought you here if things are not going well.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan cleared his throat before Yuumi could say more things to Yibo. “I’m taking Yibo with me to the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Oh, right. We’ll be having lunch that Zhanzhan prepared today. Be careful in the kitchen with that one, Yibo. He gets strict there so make sure you listen to him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<span>The kitchen staff politely greeted Xiao Zhan and Yibo as they entered the kitchen. Xiao Zhan took Yibo to the main kitchen of the mansion, not just the small kitchen he used to make snacks. He wanted a place where he was sure that everything he needed would easily be found. He introduced Yibo to the staff and he could already see the effect the alpha has on the staff, with most of them blushing as they introduced themselves. After finishing up the introductions, the kitchen staff left them alone, fully knowing that Xiao Zhan knew his way around the kitchen.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Do you cook for yourself?” Xiao Zhan asked as he wore an apron on himself. He watched as Yibo put one himself as well.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo shook his head with a chuckle. “I am shit in the kitchen. The best I could do to help you is probably to open things and cut things.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I am quite confident about my cooking but if there’s something you don’t like I’d appreciate it if you tell me. Especially since it seems like it will always be me who will be cooking.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>With his resolve to really show Yibo who he was, Xiao Zhan did not held back on instructing the alpha while they cooked. Contrary to how Taiga and Yuumi teased him about his attitude in the kitchen, Xiao Zhan still had the right amount of balance of strictness and kindness when he was cooking.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Unfortunately, Yibo was really a hopeless case in the kitchen. Xiao Zhan found himself deeply sighing multiple times and taking over whatever he asked Yibo to do instead. Halfway through, he gave up and asked Yibo to just sit on one of the stools in the kitchen island. Xiao Zhan was not used to having an audience while he cooked aside from Taiga and Yuumi. Right now, even with his back turned, he could feel the gaze of the alpha never leaving him. Somehow, it did not make Xiao Zhan nervous. Instead, it made him feel excited to see the reaction of the alpha to what he was cooking.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo might have been a hopeless case in the kitchen but Xiao Zhan was grateful to having another pair of hands that helped him place the dishes he cooked to serving plates. The kitchen staff came back just in time to help them carry the serving plates to the dining room.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Hiroki, Yuumi, and Taiga were all waiting in the dining room when Xiao Zhan and Yibo had arrived. Yuumi gestured for Xiao Zhan to take the seat next to her, leaving Yibo no other choice but to take the seat next to Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“They all look good, Xiao Zhan,” Taiga complimented the food as it was served on the table.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan chuckled, noticing that Taiga acknowledged the food without even acknowledging Yibo’s presence who was seated right beside him. He knew Taiga was just being his usual stubborn self, he won’t show it yet to his parents that he and Xiao Zhan had a talk about Wang Yibo and Taiga had found him as a not so bad match for his cousin.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan noticed too that Yibo paid it no mind at all. The alpha relaxed in his seat beside Taiga while having a look of admiration at the food served at the table. It made Xiao Zhan feel proud about himself.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Tell us, Yibo,” Yuumi broke the silence as they started their lunch. “Are you on a strict diet or do you eat whenever? Our Xiao Zhan here loves to cook, you’ll surely be well fed.” There was a teasing smile on her face as she talked.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo was nodding along as Yuumi talked. “I am not on any diet. I eat whatever and whenever. I’m just not too good with spicy things.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Ah, that’s a shame,” Taiga said. “Xiao Zhan loves spicy things.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yuumi chuckled. “Xiao Zhan would just have to spare us all now if things with Yibo works out.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The rest of the lunch was filled with random conversations. Mostly led by Yuumi as she was excited to have a lively table now that Xiao Zhan and Taiga were back from staying at the hotel for the weekend. Xiao Zhan paid close attention to Yibo instead of throwing in topics of his own. While he did respond from time to time, he would much rather look at Yibo’s plate than talk too much. There’s a triumphant smile trying to break out of Xiao Zhan as the alpha seemed to enjoy his cooking enough to eat more than he usually does.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yuumi had worked her charm on all of them so much that no one was able to resist when she insisted they all spend the afternoon together in her entertainment lounge. There, she was successful in getting them to watch a movie she was looking forward to watching.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p align="justify">
<span>“Sorry, we ended up spending most of our day with my family,” Xiao Zhan fidgeted with the hem of his sweatshirt. “That wasn’t exactly what I had planned for today.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Your home-cooked meal more than made up for everything, Zhange.” Yibo reached his hand to cup Xiao Zhan’s cheek. “I’m not in any rush to get to know everything about you. I’m pretty sure we have a lot of time to get to know each other.” There was nothing but confidence in the way Yibo spoke, he was so sure about spending a lot of time with Xiao Zhan.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Yibo, you can say no, alright?” Xiao Zhan said as he leaned into the touch. “I would like to invite you inside my room.” He could feel his chest thumping, his nervousness was visible in his eyes. “I’m not trying to do anything funny, okay? I just want to show you something.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Nothing you’re not ready for, Xiao Zhan.” Yibo’s voice was gentle. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan shook his head. A little shy smile played on his face. “I really do want to invite you inside but just to show you some things. No funny business.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Now I’m curious about what you want to show me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan took Yibo’s hand in his, giving it a light squeeze before leading them inside his bedroom.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The room was just how he left it when he started staying at the hotel. Xiao Zhan’s canopy bed was in the middle of the room, it’s headboard leaning on the wall. On the bed’s left were tiered displays of plushies, the shelves reaching until the end of the room. On the right side of the bed were Xiao Zhan’s closets and vanity mirror. A door leading to an ensuite bathroom was found at the right side of the room. On the far right, there was a TV on the wall with Xiao Zhan’s gaming consoles on the cabinet below it. In front was a sofa. On the far left corner was a bookshelf and a study table.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“So this is where you rest after a long day?” Yibo stopped short of the bed, gazing over Xiao Zhan’s plushies with a smile on his face. “You must be adorable all curled up hugging one of your plushies.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan blushed, if anything, his massive plushie collection was something he was the most nervous about today. “Do - do you like them?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Your collection is cute. Just like you.” Yibo was still trailing his gaze along the lines of the plushies. “They look fluffy, too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re free to touch them you know?” Xiao Zhan chuckled.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I don’t want to rub my scent on them. You might be using them when nesting.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I - ” The words got caught in Xiao Zhan’s throat. He felt his chest clenched at how considerate Yibo was being.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange, in exchange for not being able to touch them just yet, can I hug you instead?” Yibo opened up his arms invitingly. A hopeful smile on his face.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan closed the distance between them and let Yibo envelop him in an embrace. Xiao Zhan lifted his own arms and loosely wrapped them around Yibo’s waist. He rested his head on Yibo’s shoulder despite the alpha being shorter than him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo planted a gentle kiss on the side of Xiao Zhan’s head. “Thank you for opening up to me, Zhange. I know how nervous you've been since we left the hotel. I – I'm not good with my words," He held Xiao Zhan tighter. "But, Zhange, the more I get to know you, the more I like you."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan, with his lack of experience in dating, has never been held like this before except for his family. With Yibo's arm securely around him and a hand caressing his head, Xiao Zhan all but melted and snuggled closer.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"I'm glad to know that, Yibo. I like you, too."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Zhange," Yibo loosened his hold on Xiao Zhan as the omega lifted his head up so they would be face to face. "I better go to my room now." A teasing smile tugged up on Yibo's lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Am I making you uncomfortable?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"You could never, Zhange," Yibo swept some of Xiao Zhan's loose hair to the side. "It's just, this room smells so much like you and if you haven't noticed, you're spreading pheromones too. I don't want to do anything you are not ready for."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan flushed at the thought. "Uhm, okay." He let go of Yibo. "Do you want me to bring you to your room?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"No need. It's just two doors from here anyway." Yibo still had an arm hooked around Xiao Zhan. "Good night, Xiao Zhan."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"I'll see you in the morning, Wang Yibo."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

</p><p align="justify">
<span>"Zhange," Yibo entered the small kitchen.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Ah, Yibo," Xiao Zhan looked up from what he was doing to greet the alpha. "Good morning. Were you looking around for me?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>In the kitchen island in front of Xiao Zhan were various types of sandwiches ranging from pork cutlets, chicken salad, ham, and some with fruit and cream fillings. There's also the smell of freshly brewed tea lingering in the air.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"I knocked on your door. One of the staff saw me and told me you're here in the little kitchen. She was kind enough to lead me here."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Take a seat," Xiao Zhan went back to arranging a sandwiches.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo took a seat at one of the stolls on the kitchen island. "Do you need any help?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"This was supposed to be a surprise for you. I wasn't expecting you'd wake up before I even finish." Xiao Zhan said without any hint of disappointment but instead a smile on his face. "Let's make the most out of the situation and prepare this picnic together. Maybe it'll be more fun than surprising you."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Zhange, I'm supposed to be the one doing things for you. I'm the one courting you."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>"Yibo, I love being in the kitchen. Just think of this as me showing gratitude towards you always making time for me. Now make yourself useful and prepare whatever fruit juice you like."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Having two people working on preparing the picnic let them finish in time to make it to a decent hour for brunch. Yibo insisted on carrying both of the picnic baskets leaving only the picnic mat for Xiao Zhan to carry.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The weather was tipping in favor of Xiao Zhan’s plans. The sun was out but it was not too hot. He led the way to a shaded part in the garden, under a sakura tree. They say on opposite sides of the picnic mat. Xiao Zhan unpacked the sandwiches while Yibo busied himself with pouring drinks on their glasses.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“These are really good, Zhange!” Yibo said before shoving another triangle sandwich in his mouth.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Eat slowly, Yibo. No one will steal your food. It’s just us here.” Xiao Zhan chuckled as he reached for a strawberry cream sandwich for himself. “I haven’t had a picnic since… since my parents passed away,”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo placed down the sandwich in his hand and moved closer to Xiao Zhan’s side. He moved around some of the sandwiches to make room for himself. “Zhange, from now on, whenever you feel like having a picnic, you can always call on me to join you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Even when I get bossy with the preparations?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>The two laughed in unison.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo extended his arm to ruffle Xiao Zhan’s hair. “I’ll be your slave in the kitchen. I don’t care. As long as I can see that smile of yours.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Wang Yibo. You say you’re not good with words but somehow you always know the right things to say to fluster me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange,” Yibo stood up, he extended his hand as an invitation. “Would you like to dance under the sun with me?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“There’s no music,” Xiao Zhan raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“What’s the use of phones if not for situations like this.” Tapping on his phone for a couple of times, Yibo played a slow paced song before laying his phone on top of the picnic basket. “Can I now have this dance?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Xiao Zhan stood up with the help of Yibo. He placed his arms over Yibo’s shoulder while the alpha wrapped his arms around Xiao Zhan’s waist. Their bodies were pressed together as Yibo took the lead, Xiao Zhan following along his movements.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re so beautiful, Xiao Zhan.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“You’re not looking so bad yourself, Wang Yibo.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>They swayed and turned in time with the music. There were no other words exchanged between them, both being lost in each other’s eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>When Yibo cupped Xiao Zhan’s face, the omega immediately leaned into the touch.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Zhange, can I kiss you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>They had stopped dancing. A song was still playing on Yibo’s phone but the two simply stood there, holding each other.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I – Yibo, I have never been kissed before so,” Xiao Zhan nervously chuckled. “I guess I’m in your care then.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo slowly leaned in and angled his head to properly slot their lips together. Yibo moved his lips, coercing Xiao Zhan to follow suit. They exchanged soft gentle kisses before Yibo pulled away. He kissed both of Xiao Zhan’s cheek before tilting down the omega’s face to reach his forehead with a long lingering kiss.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yibo leaned their foreheads together. “I don’t think I can ever let you go, Xiao Zhan.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Then don’t.” Xiao Zhan placed a chaste kiss on Yibo’s lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“Stay with me. Be with me.” Yibo said in between peppering Xiao Zhan’s face with kisses. “Next weekend, come with me. I’ll show you parts of myself too. Before you decide to stay with me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I’m looking forward to getting to know you more, Yibo.”</span>
