    <h2 class="toc-heading">if this is the last time i’ll touch you (i’ll do it day or night)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Hokuto spent years praying to the gods, he spent years waking up and giving offerings, spending hours on his knees begging to be forgiven for his sins, spending hours dedicated to living a good life so the gods would smile upon him, so he could cross the Styx and not live a sorrowful life in the underworld, but in Elysium, where the sun is high and where the grass is never too rough on your feet. Hokuto dreamt of a life after death that was filled with bliss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, how could he ignore the promise of eternal peace in the afterlife by a god he worshiped? How could he stop himself from peppering kisses all over his thighs, how could he not bask in his beauty, how could Hokuto not delicately hold him like he’d break if he was too harsh? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s where Hokuto found himself every night, when the stars were hung up, when the moon shone over the islands. He found himself atop a hill, where the statue of his god was, where he found himself on his knees, breathlessly kissing his beautiful body as though he would disappear within seconds. Heaven forgive him, Hokuto only wanted to consume all of him, Hokuto only wanted him all to himself. He looked up into his god’s eyes, filled with so much yearning, as though he was begging to be allowed to go further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My sweet servant,” He speaks, grabbing the boy by his jaw with a sly smirk, “Always so good for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All for you… All for you,” Hokuto repeats, as though it was a prayer, “All for you, Taiga.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga would never admit it, but his heart does tug a little for the mortal, behind his dark eyes there is a small amount of warmth reserved for Hokuto. And maybe, if the roles were swapped, Taiga would have worshiped him the same way Hokuto is now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s one request you have right now, my pet?” The god asks, eyes still locked with the mortal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Breathlessly, and exasperated, Hokuto shudders as he holds Taiga’s wrist, “Please kiss me, my God.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you wish,” He pulls Hokuto up with a smile. Their lips come crashing like the waves Poseidon unleashed to those who dared to defile the oceans. Hokuto lets out a soft gasp as Taiga pries his mouth open, he allows him in as though his body was all his. If anyone listened closely, you could hear the soft whimpers escaping from the back of Hokuto’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga lets go of Hokuto but his lips ache again to feel him, “More, more please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I that good, pet?” Taiga flashes a cheeky grin, “I said one request. Get to work,” He pushes Hokuto down, foot against the younger’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nods, hands shaky as he reaches them out to pull down the cloth covering Taiga’s cock. He feels the oxygen get knocked out of his lungs once again as he leaves messy kisses all over Taiga’s inner thighs, he looks up and catches a glimpse of the latter’s begging eyes. Hokuto didn’t need to hear it to know that Taiga wanted him as much as he wanted Taiga, and he took pride in that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He uses a free hand to stroke Taiga’s stiff cock slowly, thumb rubbing at the slit on the tip. He hears the way the older’s breath shudders at the sensation of Hokuto’s delicate hands, ones Taiga had trained to pleasure him and only him. Hokuto pecks the hardened shaft, almost like it was a gift from the gods as he swirls his tongue on the tip, watching his spit lubricate it ever so slightly. Slowly, he takes all of Taiga in his mouth, feeling the tip hit the back of his throat. It sends a chill down the immortal’s spine, he loses control and grabs a fistful of Hokuto’s pretty black hair. He moves his hips with such fervour, and he’d be lying if he said it didn’t make him even harder with the way he could so clearly hear Hokuto gagging on his cock, pretty eyes fluttering as he looked up at him, tears stuck on his lashes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, so good,” Taiga moans, “Just a bit more, you’ll take it all, won’t you, pet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shakes his head a little and Taiga smiles, “Good boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly reaching his climax, Taiga has a final thrust in Hokuto’s mouth as the latter feels his cum pool at his tongue. Taiga taps his cheek and the younger sticks his tongue out, showing the translucent liquid in his muth, “Swallow,” And Hokuto obliges, swallowing all of Taiga’s essence and he shows his empty mouth once more, “Atta boy..”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Hokuto though the tent in his pants had gone unnoticed, he was sorely mistaken as he felt the bottom of Taiga’s foot press against his crotch, sending a soft gasp out of his lips, “My god, please..”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga only hums in response, “Hm? What is it, my servant? Use your words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto only whines in response which he’s only given a grab of his jaw in return, the pressure on his clothed dick only increasing with the press of Taiga’s foot, “Have you gone dumb? I said use your words.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please touch me,” Hokuto whispers, “I want to feel your touch. Please allow me your touch, my benevolent God.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga scoffs in reply as he crouches down, not breaking eye contact with Hokuto as he reaches his hand down to rub at his clothed crotch. A soft mewl makes its way out of Hokuto’s soft lips, “Please, please, more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you to ask a god for more, whore?” Taiga’s grip on his jaw tightens, “Shut up and thank me for what I give you, hm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto feels tears trickle at the corner of his eyes as he nods, “Thank you, thank you, thank you…” He moans as he feels himself reaching his climax from the slightest touch. He grinds slowly against Taiga’s hands only to feel a stinging sensation against his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are my touches not good enough? Weren’t you begging me for my touch?” Taiga looks down at him, “Did I give you permission to move?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! I’m sorry,” Hokuto exclaims, “Forgive me, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Undress for me,” Taiga demands but all Hokuto does is look at him in shock</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone will see me,” The younger exclaims softly, “i- What will they think of me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga tilts his head in confusion, “Are you refusing my demands, my servant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shakes his head immediately and lets out a stuttering sigh as he slips off his clothing. He starts to feel the cold night air press against his skin, brushing against the most delicate areas as he feels the tickle of linen slipping past his skin. He has come undone, in front of his god, for all the other gods watching to see, yet all he can feel is the burning eyes of Taiga behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga wants to wrap his arms around Hokuto, he wants to place gentle kisses on his shoulder blades but he can’t and he won’t allow the affection harbored in his heart to take the reigns on his actions. Cause if Hokuto found out, oh if Hokuto knew it, he wouldn’t know what to do, he wouldn’t know what to say but ‘I love you’. And it scared him so he turns to dragging his index finger down Hokuto’s back as the boy shudders. He is pushed down by Taiga’s palm on his back, to the ground as his knees dig into the gravel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can hear your thoughts,” Taiga whispers, “Tell me, do you worship me as your only god?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Hokuto says simply, but it held so much weight. It was an admittance of allegiance, a proposal of undivided love. And lucky Taiga, it was all for him. He had this pretty boy all for himself, with no god being able to touch him the way he does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga nods, stroking himself in front of Hokuto’s entrance as he slowly inserts himself. Muffled moans can be heard from Hokuto as he covers his mouth, but Taiga pulls his hands away, “Let me hear you, my servant.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made Hokuto’s heart flutter as butterflies erupted in his stomach, he doesn’t deny Taiga that request as he feels him go deeper. He mutters his name repeatedly like a mantra, squeezing his eyes shut as though he was feeling him for the first time. He leans back, flushing his back against Taiga’s clothed chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Taiga mutters, gripping Hokuto’s hips, “Look at you,” He chuckles, “My most obedient pet, letting me use him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto could no longer utter a word with his brain slowly shutting down from the pleasure coursing through his body. But when Taiga starts moving, he swears he feels himself melt in his touch. His tip hitting that spot Taiga knew made Hokuto see stars, and slowly Hokuto starts losing himself as his god looks at him while laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already?” Taiga lets out a breathy laugh, “Now that’s no fun,” He forces Hokuto to look at his statue in front of the two of them, “Look at it, created and made with so much honour, made to be respected, but look at you defiling such a holy space. You love it, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto turns his head away but Taiga’s grip turns his face back, “Look at it, look at the offerings around us. So many people begging for my grace, so many people desperate for my blessing. If I didn’t know any better, I would have assumed you enjoyed this, enjoyed the way your god uses you like you’re nothing but a whore,” Taiga moves closer to Hokuto’s ear, “But that’s what you are, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger can’t even answer him, all he can do is nod as his eyes fixate on the stone sculpture. He visited the hill every day, praying to him, it was a place of sacredness, but he was there every night, getting his brains knocked out by Taiga. His cock twitches and the older smiles, “Disgusting,” He reaches his hands down to stroke the boy’s twitching cock, causing Hokuto to gasp loudly. Taiga continues thrusting in him, soft groans resounding in his throat as lewd sounds echo from their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto loses control of his body as falls forward, the only thing he could make out was sobs from the overstimulation and the moans with each drag of Taiga’s cock in his hole, he no longer cared who heard, he no longer cared who saw, he was too tied up in the pleasure Taiga graced him with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The immortal feels the knot in him tightening and with the whines Hokuto was letting out, he knew he was coming soon. He moves faster, the sounds that came with the contact of their skins grew louder by the second and Hokuto swears he’s seeing stars with the urgency in Taiga’s thrusts, “Ah- come for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A final thrust and Taiga emptied himself in Hokuto’s hole as he felt the boy come in his palms. Hokuto pants a little, chest rising and falling as he mentally rode out the high. Taiga pulls him up against his chest, bringing his stained hand up to which Hokuto sucks on his digits, cleaning his hand ever so obediently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grabs a random piece of fabric laying around and wraps it around Hokuto’s shoulders. Taiga places a kiss on the crook of Hokuto’s neck, hoping it’s meaning gets lost in the younger boy’s fucked out mind. He allowed him to lay in his arms as the stars shined down on them, he wraps his arms around Hokuto’s shoulders and calms him down, brushing his hair to the sidd as his head falls on Taiga’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The older swears he feels his heart grow as he seems Hokuto’s soft smile, he tries to hide the fondness in his face as he brings him closer, feeling him slip into a sleep. Taiga never loved, he never admired, but maybe, he’d set aside his rules for Hokuto, maybe, if he wanted to, he’d open up his heart a little to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My love, I am yours forever, now and into the afterlife,” Taiga whispers a soft confession, as he lulls the younger deeper into sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga doesn’t know this, but Hokuto’s heart shudders at his words. But he keeps silent. Some things are better left unsaid.</span>
