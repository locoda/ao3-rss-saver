    <div class="userstuff">
      <p><br />
This might be what people called the classic story of an IT company CEO and a pretty national treasure idol. Masaya has heard this pattern many times on the news. He did not expect he would be the one to live such a story.</p><p> </p><p>Sato Masaya is the CEO of a fast growing IT startup in Tokyo. He is in his 40s and has been in the industry for more than 20 years now. He decided to go back to Japan from his established career in the US after an old friend (who is also the only son of the conglomerate family of Kyomoto) announced a new joint venture project and asked Masaya to spearhead it. He needed the change in environment anyway. Otherwise, an old man like him would start rotting away if he were to stay in one place too long. That, and a couple of other reasons.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya’s daily life involves attending a meeting, asking Juri to prepare slides and report for him, attending another meeting, attending business invitations, attending yet another meeting, and going for a drink.</p><p> </p><p>Now, this routine has a new addition to it: playing golf.</p><p> </p><p>As someone who is involved in this line of work, golf is not something new for him. Some of his best deals happened in golf fields. He was just not interested enough to actually play it.</p><p> </p><p>That was until he met the supposed idol of this story─please let it be him─at a celebration event held by a client company selling bath salts.</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, he is the brand ambassador of one of their best-selling signature products. They gave him this cute character nickname to advertise the product.</p><p> </p><p>His actual name is way cuter though, it’s Kouchi Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo is a young idol who is recently making waves and is in high demand for variety show works. He hides his age for some reason. Masaya heard he is 30 years old but he personally thinks Yugo’s face can pass as that of someone in their early twenties.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo from that night was sparkling. He smiled cutely to everyone, greeted everyone cutely, and he drank the apple juice cutely. He seems like an epitome of someone whose motto is “Smile everyday” or something. </p><p> </p><p>So, this is the true power of an idol, Masaya was in awe.</p><p> </p><p>The marketing director of the bath salts company introduced Masaya to him and when Yugo mentioned golfing, Masya found himself responding excitedly that Oh we should play together sometimes, I also like golfing!! which was a complete lie. </p><p> </p><p>So, he spent the following week watching golfing tutorials Juri had prepared. He even hired a trainer to teach him swinging stances so as to not embarrass himself in front of Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>Along with the marketing director, they somehow made a plan to play together with Yugo. Apparently, Yugo is famous for going out with a lot of higher-ups and big names in the showbiz industry. Masaya scrunched his face when he heard about this information.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya worked hard to push the first plan into the second and the second turned into the third.</p><p> </p><p>While the formal style Yugo is neat and cute, the casual style Yugo is refreshing and even cuter─and now Masaya is wondering what his homey, off-style look would be like. Yugo occasionally wears a cap or bucket hat to their golfing get-together. He often wears shorts, showing the smooth skin of his legs.</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, those wellness influencers are half right. Playing golf does greatly improve your quality of life. They just missed mentioning Kouchi Yugo</p><p> </p><p>Yugo is a joy to be around. He is easy to talk to. He brings this comforting, healing air around him.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya has eaten his breakfast alone for years. He would never expect someone more than fifteen years younger to ignite this feeling that makes him want to try hard for someone else. One feeling he thought he was no longer capable of experiencing.</p><p> </p><p>Juri said Masaya smiled more, showed less dark sour faces, and made less stupid decisions. The people in the company also benefit from Masaya’s improved mood. The workplace wellbeing score is at a record high, they cancelled an appointment with a consulting agency.</p><p> </p><p>As expected, the power of an idol to bring happiness to everyday’s life, Masa was again in awe.</p><p> </p><p>This period might be what the media would narrate as “during which they develop a good feeling towards each other”.</p><p> </p><p>Nearing the fourth plan, the marketing director, which might be described by the media as “the third party who introduced them to each other”, being a good employee that he is, said that he had to miss their get-together time around due to some new projects at the company. This is also an expected development in the classic CEO x idol story─it’s not not like Masaya planned this and hinted to the good employee marketing director, not at all.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Yugo showed up in an oversized polo with nicely fitted shorts.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m truly sorry you ended up making time out of your busy schedule just to meet me, Sato-san.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, time spent with Yugo is never a waste,” he didn’t remember he could make such a gooey honey sticky voice. “Also, it’s Masaya please.”</p><p> </p><p>The image of Yugo blushing prettily is enough to make Masaya consider quitting his job, returning the company back to the Kyomoto, and serving as a house husband that could accompany Yugo to golfing anytime.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Yugo chooses to play on an actual golf course and not the usual driving range they had been on the past weeks.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s good to challenge ourselves, Masaya-san!” which Masaya agrees with. He just did not expect it to also involve him challenging his self control.</p><p> </p><p>For some reason, Masaya becomes hyper-aware of a lot of things. The lot of things being the way Yugo hips sways when he swings, Yugo’s plump butts when he bends to pick the ball, Yugo’s cute noises when he misses the ball, Yugo’s pouty lips when he messes his control-</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, my bad!” Yugo turned around, looking up with his big moist eyes at Masaya after the ball went to a shaded area of the field, near the trees.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya would even start a war over that face, he thought to himself but he chooses to say “Don’t sweat it,” and pats Yugo’s head gently. Masaya swears Yugo slightly leans his face towards him but it might just be his acute delusion.</p><p> </p><p>He forces himself to come to his senses and hits the ball, trying to get it back into the track near the target. </p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s compliment over Masaya’s strong swing feels good but the next moment, the ball is back to the shaded area.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya is pretty sure that Yugo is supposed to be better than him at this. Maybe he does feel uncomfortable playing just the two of them? Maybe Masaya makes him feel uneasy that he messes up his control?</p><p> </p><p>He is about to hit the ball back when he catches Yugo stealing a glance at him. Yugo’s pupil dilated despite the bright sun of the summer.</p><p> </p><p>So, he hits the ball further into the woods area.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo looks behind his back at him, smiling, before heading, skipping in his steps, into the area with more trees.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya gulps. He rushes after Yugo into the shaded area when Yugo turns his body suddenly and Masaya feels a smaller body crash on him. The body would have fallen if not for Masaya’s hands wrapping around Yugo’s thin waist.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s face is too close, Masaya can count the moles adorning his face. If he was to move a few millimeters, his lips would touch Yugo’s.</p><p> </p><p>So he does.</p><p> </p><p>They are as soft as he imagined them to be and sweeter than he imagined them to be. The previously soft pink colored lips are now almost crimson. There is a hint of watermelon flavour. </p><p> </p><p>He wants more of it so Masaya starts sucking on Yugo’s lower lips. Not wasting Yugo’s slightly open lips, Masaya pushes his tongue into Yugo’s mouth and is instantly greeted by Yugo's own. Encouraged by Yugo’s response, he explores a deeper, wetter area. </p><p> </p><p>He feels light punches on his chest. </p><p> </p><p>A string of saliva drops as they separate. Yugo has a completely melting face, eyes droopy, lips swollen and crimson and it takes Masaya’s whole self control not to start devouring everything.</p><p> </p><p>“Took you long enough,” Yugo looks pleased and out of breath.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya blinks once, twice.</p><p> </p><p>All the time he thought he had succumbed into a perverted old man, all of it was a deliberate act. Well, Masaya apparently does become a pervert when it comes to Yugo but it’s still partly Yugo’s fault.</p><p> </p><p>He should have expected that he is currently dealing with one cunning little devil.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya feels a sudden numb pain in his lower body. “Do you want to do something about this?” Yugo's hand grabs at his now embarrassingly obvious erect dick, visible even through the fabric of his pants.</p><p> </p><p>**</p><p> </p><p>Masaya drove like a madman to a nearby hotel. Maybe it’s a good thing he was forced to learn driving while in the US─the options were that or getting run over trying to walk. He couldn’t imagine being a loser who can’t drive the person he is trying to woo.</p><p> </p><p>He is waiting on the edge of a luxurious large bed at the moment. Sound of a shower running nearby somehow makes his palms damp. He could feel a drop of sweat trickling down his back.</p><p> </p><p>After what feels like forever, Yugo steps out only with a bathrobe on, the fabric slides down his shoulders, showing his smooth skin.</p><p> </p><p>He stops in between Masaya’s spreaded legs, face gazing down at Masaya’s own positioned on the lower level.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo smells so good Masaya just has to kiss him. He just found out the fact today but his brain seems to already mentally note that he likes kissing Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya guides Yugo’s nape to deepen the kiss. Another hand caresses Yugo’s waist before going down to squeeze the fleshy buttocks.</p><p> </p><p>He can feel Yugo’s fingers scratching his sweaty neck and shoulders as they find their way under the clothing. The difference in their appearance, his sweaty skin smelling of sun and Yugo’s moist skin with a fresh scent, Yugo barely in any clothing and him still fully clothed makes him feel like he is doing something really bad. As if he is violating something pure and fragile.</p><p> </p><p>Next thing he knows, Yugo crouches down in front of Masaya. He gazes up with those sinful droopy eyes before breathing in on Masaya’s clothed damp cock. He kisses the shaft gently, eyes closed, his eyelashes thick and long. When the whole length is free from his drenched underwear, Yugo starts alternating between licking and sucking like it’s his favorite thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>That’s a young idol with thousands of fans willing to die to receive blowing kisses, currently blowing Masaya’s old dick, his brain supplies.</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.. nh..” Yugo starts playing with his behind. His ass points up as he puts his own fingers in his hole. It is quite a view Masaya is subjected to from above.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya gulps, forcibly straining the raging wolf inside him eager to pound on Yugo right there. He will let Yugo do whatever he is comfortable with this first time. He can start thinking of other things to try at later times.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya mentally punches himself as he realises his mind starts getting ahead of himself, again.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo gets up and climbs on his lap. He skillfully positions the crack of his ass on Masaya’s fully erect cock. His length rubs on the slit as Yugo moves his hip back and forth. Yugo’s own dick, slimy with precum rubbing on Masaya’s toned abs.</p><p> </p><p>“Nh… Masa-san…” He can feel the head kissing Yugo’s entrance</p><p> </p><p>At this point, Masaya would burst before he can enter Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>“Yugo-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>He really is gonna make him say it huh. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you let me put it in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm… what?” </p><p> </p><p>Masaya is his 40 for crying out loud, he won’t shy away from such talk.</p><p> </p><p>One hand holds Yugo's hip in place, crawling over the crack, already wet with slimy liquid Yugo might have put in while he was in the bathroom. Another hand holds his chin so he can look at Yugo in the eyes, diluted with heat, moist with pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>“My dick inside Yugo’s pussy, fucking it hard and deep,” he practically growls as his rationality and patience running thin.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya hears Yugo’s whimpers, shuddering in his lap. </p><p> </p><p>Yuugo lets the robe slide off completely as he crawls into the middle of the bed. Completely naked, he spreads his legs to form M shaped, and gleefully presents his twitching hole at Masaya, “Hehe, then please.”</p><p> </p><p>At this, he pulls down his pants just enough to quickly put the rubber and pour some lube before finally pushing his cock home, wriggling inside Yugo’s folds. Once the head is in, the length slides in easily. There's no way it's Yugos' first time but he will need to interrogate him later.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s mouth gapes silently as he slowly takes Masaya’s size.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya’s whole shaft is buried inside Yugo, glands pressed at his ass. It is warm and tight and feels so good.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmh.. I was afraid I needed to seduce a married man,” Yugo mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya chuckles. What kind of fantasies did he have? </p><p> </p><p>Not like Masaya doesn’t have his own.</p><p> </p><p>“I did have quite an experience, you see.”</p><p> </p><p>Yugo raises amused eyebrows at which Masaya takes as a challenge to start thrusting and pushing and shoving at everything.</p><p> </p><p>“Nh… mh… a-ah!” Yugo throw back his head.</p><p> </p><p>His dick pries open Yugo’s stifling insides, filling every inch of him. Squelching sound gets louder.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah- there-”</p><p> </p><p>He pushes his head on the spots that elicits high pitched moans from Yugo, his insides sucking and clamping desperately at his dick.</p><p> </p><p>Pleasure and heat are pooling heavily in his abdomen, his chest, his brain. Masaya is enveloped by Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>“Masaya-san you’re really good… it feels so good,” Yugo’s nails scratch on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya pushes aside the strands of hair sticking at Yugo’s forehead gently, taking a better look at Yugo’s face, eyes unfocused, long eyelashes fluttering, lips panting, tongue out with saliva. </p><p> </p><p>God, he’s beautiful</p><p> </p><p>He decides that Yugo squirming with pleasure under him is his favorite style of Yugo for now.</p><p> </p><p>“Yugo, you like my experienced dick?” He is amused at his own question.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo nods frantically. “Yugo loves it…” words lisping and slurring. He rubs at his belly. </p><p> </p><p>As he continues to rock into Yugo, Masaya can feel Yugo’s inside dutifully accepting his shape.</p><p> </p><p>Heart is full at Yugo's cute reaction, Masaya rains kisses at his temples, eyes, nose, lips and slurps the drools dripping Yugo’s chin. He can’t waste anything when Yugo accepts and gives generously.</p><p> </p><p>“Nnh-!” Masaya pulls him closer, hands squeeze the plump buttocks, pushing him to meet his thrust halfway, eliciting a high pitched squeals from Yugo in between squelching noises from their bare skins. </p><p> </p><p>He's glad they are protected by the thick walls of the hotel, he absolutely will not let anyone else hear this.</p><p> </p><p>“Aah… mnh…”</p><p> </p><p>Yugo’s back arches, pushing Masaya’s cock straight into the deepest part of Yugo.</p><p> </p><p>Masaya’s heat topples over the edge as Yugo’s body convulses, flesh spasms and clenches at Masa’s entire length. Murky liquid drips from Yugo’s tip into Masaya's abdomen. Pleasure overriding Masaya’s consciousness as his own come spurts and fills the rubber inside.</p><p> </p><p>As his consciousness resurfaces, Masaya slowly takes in the sight of Yugo's limp body under him. A tiny body that had accepted everything Masaya had given.</p><p> </p><p>“Yugo, are you okay?” Masaya hears his own voice sound so sweet. He caresses Yugo’s cheek gently, afraid it will break if he puts too much pressure.</p><p> </p><p>Yugo slowly opens his eyes. He gapes to say something but nothing comes out of his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to drink water?” Masaya moves to get off the bed before Yugo weakly pulls at his hem and presses their lips together. </p><p> </p><p>It was just a fleeting, feathery, vanilla touch compared to what they just did but his heart thumps and tighten at this anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Considering the difference in their power, Masaya was being extra careful not to make Yugo do something he doesn’t want to do. However, it might just be a baseless worry. Yugo knows exactly what he does, he knows how to pull a string at all Masaya’s soft spots for him.</p><p> </p><p>He is more than happy to surrender himself to Yugo completely.</p>
