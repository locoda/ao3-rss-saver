<h2 class="toc-heading">Practice makes...decent?</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The Nagoya concerts, all three of them, will be postponed to somewhere around early March.</p><p>It’s not a surprise - not when both Jesse and Shintaro have been down with nasty cases of Covid for the past five days, and Juri just posted a gloomy photo of a positive home test in their group chat this morning. There’s no way any of them will be back at work within a week, so there is no other choice but to postpone the concerts. It’s still a bummer though.</p><p>“I’ve made some changes into your schedule for the next week,” Takahashi-san, their manager, says as he pushes a printed copy of a revised timetable across the table so Hokuto can take a closer look at it. “Everything with the whole group has been postponed of course, but I managed to move some of your solo interviews up for tomorrow and Monday.”</p><p>Hokuto gives the timetable a precursory look and grabs his phone so he can take a picture of the paper. “Sounds good,” he says slowly, tapping the screen of the phone to make the camera focus on the small print, and trying to memorize the changes at the same time. “So TV Guide will be replacing the Myojo interview tomorrow, and-” His eyes stop at the present day’s last appointment with a title <i>Guitar lesson (Kyomoto)</i>. The same title is also on the two whole-day blocks where the Nagoya concerts were supposed to be on the next Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>“There are some mistakes there,” he says and pushes the paper across the table again. “I’ve got Kyomoto’s guitar lessons on my schedule instead of mine.”</p><p>Takahashi glances at the timetable and raises his brows. “Those are your guitar lessons <i>with</i> Kyomoto.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks at him. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Your teacher has Covid too, I just got the message last night. So I booked you lessons with Kyomoto instead.”</p><p>Hokuto’s stomach drops uncomfortably. He’s supposed to play guitar for <i>Kyrie no uta</i>, and the first shots of the movie will be taken in early April, so the director and the manager decided he should take some guitar lessons so he can at least <i>look</i> like he knows what he’s doing. But.</p><p>“You mean- Kyomoto is going to teach me? ”</p><p>Takahashi nods, brows even higher up. “Yes. Is there a problem?”</p><p>There’s no point trying to sugar-coat it with Takahashi. “He’s going to hate it.”</p><p>“He’s not.”</p><p>"How does he even have time for this?"</p><p>"Don't you worry about that."</p><p>“It’s really a bad-”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Despite the white flu mask covering half of his face, Takahashi suddenly looks very stern, though not unkind. “Kyomoto has already agreed to teach you, and you are going to take his lessons seriously. Understood?”</p><p>Hokuto wriggles in his seat with burning cheeks, simultaneously annoyed and ashamed to be scolded like a misbehaving teenager.</p><p>It’s actually not Taiga’s company he is dreading. It's what will follow once Taiga has had to pull through a lesson or two with him. Contrary to their constant jokes about it, they <i>do</i> like each other, and Hokuto very, very much wants to keep it that way. If he’s truly honest with himself, he'd like to have much more than that, but. Well. One mustn't test their luck too much. Taiga likes him as a friend and that will have to suffice.</p><p>The problem is that he really, honestly sucks at playing the guitar. He had the first lesson last week and he’s pretty sure his actual teacher only bears with him because she’s being paid for it. There’s no way Taiga will have enough patience for him.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Hokuto murmurs.</p><p>“Good,” Takahashi says with a nod. “Kyomoto will meet you at the smaller meeting room in the fifth floor at half past three. He’ll also show you the music sheet for your Shonen Club duet.”</p><p>“Our <i>what</i>?” Hokuto coughs.</p><p>“Your duet for the Shonen Club show in April.”</p><p>“You expect me to play guitar in front of a whole Shonen Club audience,” Hokuto says blankly, wondering when he’ll wake up and realize it’s all just a nightmare.</p><p>Now, Takahashi actually has the heart to look amused, with gentle wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. “You’ll be fine. The audience will love your performance. You learned to play shamisen for Gamushara, and you will learn to play guitar for Shokura.”</p><p>"The shamisen only has three strings," Hokuto grumbles under his breath, just for the sake of it. Takahashi doesn't even bother replying to that.</p><p>It’s going to take him dozens of hours to learn even the simplest piece. And they’re sentencing Taiga to spend a notable part of those hours alone with him. Hokuto puts on the best pleading face he can muster under his own mask.</p><p>“Really, Kyomoto and I- we never spend time alone like that. Don’t you have such friends, too? You know, people you see at work and you genuinely like them, but you <i>never</i> meet them on private?”</p><p>“It’s a good thing your guitar lessons are not private time then,” Takahashi says and stands up. “I’ve got to go now. I need to catch Kochi to inform him about his new schedule as well.”</p><p>And just like that he exits the meeting room, leaving Hokuto to suffer alone.</p><p>The situation requires physical effort, and Hokuto heads to the empty dance hall where they would’ve had a practice session today, if only everyone had been on their feet.</p><p>Since the dance practice was canceled, he had planned to actually relax for the hour-and-a-half before the guitar lesson, maybe read the book he carried along today, but he can't read now. His thoughts go round and round, ruminating around Taiga, his hopeless guitar lessons, the terrifying Shokura duet, Taiga, the only slightly less terrifying prospect of fake-playing guitar in Kyrie's shooting, and… Taiga.</p><p>So he dances, going meticulously through the more energetic songs they use to rouse up their audience, repeating moves that he knows by heart until he’s exhausted and sweaty, and has only fifteen minutes to shower, change, grab his borrowed, company-owned guitar case, and find the meeting room in the fifth floor. No time to stop and stress about what’s coming next. Good.</p><p>Taiga is already there when Hokuto arrives. He looks relaxed and good, as if sitting on the gray carpet floor under the window of a meeting room is something he likes to do every day. He isn’t wearing a mask so Hokuto removes his, too, and drops it into the trash bin by the wall.</p><p>He finds it difficult to meet Taiga’s eyes.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with the chairs,” he asks as he sits down to the floor, not quite opposite to Taiga, but not by his side either, and takes his guitar out of its case.</p><p>Taiga shrugs and purses his lips. “The table is on my way if I sit on a chair,” he explains and nods at the small pile of music sheets in front of him. “And this way I can have the notes closer to me.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, looks at the papers and sighs. “Look, I’m sorry you have to do this,” he says with an apologetic grimace. “I promise to do my best, but please, <i>please</i> tell me if you think it’s hopeless or too much trouble to you, and we can try to wriggle ourselves out of this shit somehow.”</p><p>Taiga raises his brows. “You’re not hopeless. And it won’t be too much of a trouble. But alright.”</p><p>“You should hear me play before judging,” Hokuto sighs. “Ito-sensei must have suffered terribly last week.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Taiga says, but his voice is soft and amused, and Hokuto’s stomach flutters with confused butterflies. “Show me what you can do.”</p><p>What Hokuto can do with a guitar is to hold it on his lap and slowly, haltingly, place his fingertips on the correct strings and frets. When he locates them, he plays the E minor chord. Next, he switches the places of his fingers to find the A minor chord. The chord echoes in the room for a moment. The sound is wobbly and the guitar is seriously out of tune, but this is what he has, so. Taiga’s keen attention on him makes him want to squirm, and he carefully keeps his eyes in his left hand.</p><p>“Alright,” Taiga says quietly, nodding thoughtfully. “Let’s start with tuning your guitar. Do you know how to do it?”</p><p>Hokuto shakes his head. “We didn’t get to that yet. We’ve only had one thirty-minute lesson by now and Ito-sensei tuned my guitar the last time.”</p><p>“That’s fine, I’ll show you.”</p><p>Taiga proceeds to take a small tuner device from the pocket of his guitar case and show Hokuto how to use it. Turns out the process of tuning a guitar is surprisingly easy, and Hokuto grasps the idea in only a minute.</p><p>“Great, now do it again,” Taiga says, and twists the tuning pegs of Hokuto’s guitar back and forth so it’s out of tune again.</p><p>This time Hokuto only needs to check the lower E sound from the tuner device to help him in the beginning, and he can do the rest by the ear. It’s not the sounds that trouble him, he realizes as he turns the pegs, and plucks the strings to hear the slight differences in sound. He has a good ear for music, and the standard tuning, as Taiga calls it, is very logical to follow through. It’s the finger placement for the chords that he finds hard, and even more than that, the rhythm of his right hand when he tries to play the chords.</p><p>“I did it,” he says, unable to hide the delighted wonder from his voice. “I tuned it!”</p><p>“Yeah, you did,” Taiga chuckles, his eyes twinkling. Maybe he is laughing at Hokuto, but Hokuto doesn’t even mind. He’s too excited about this small step of improvement.</p><p>“Show me the music sheets for the duet,” he asks with the newly acquired spark of confidence. Maybe there is like a two-percent chance that he’s not going to completely blow their performance.</p><p>Taiga hands him the papers, and Hokuto takes a look at them, only slightly discouraged by the notes. It’s okay. He can do this. He <i>can</i> read musical notes, even though he usually learns their new songs by ear. He’s even learned enough to play a simple piece on the piano for a drama before - even though the mostly learned that by ear, too. He can do this. He <i>can</i> do this. He-</p><p>“Of course you can’t do it yet,” Taiga says, and Hokuto frowns at him, because what the hell? Taiga is probably right, but couldn’t he be a bit more encouraging still?</p><p>Then he sees Taiga’s expression and realizes that maybe Taiga is trying to do exactly that. He’s right after all - Hokuto can’t play it yet. But he will. Eventually. Probably. At least there is a chance.</p><p>“Yeah,” he says, like the verbal genius he is. “Where do I start?”</p><p>Taiga scoots closer to poke at the papers. “You know E minor and A minor already, that’s good, though you only need the E here. Now here’s how you play A major.”</p><p>Taiga shows Hokuto the correct position of fingers and waits until Hokuto manages to play the chord. Then he makes Hokuto switch between the E minor and A major, until he can do it relatively smoothly. Next, Taiga shows him D major and finally something that reads B7 on paper. Hokuto considers asking about the number seven, but he decides to let it go. He probably doesn’t need to know.</p><p>“No, look, your little finger should be on the first string,” Taiga says and reaches over, firmly taking Hokuto’s finger and guiding it to the right place. Hokuto’s skin raises on goose bumps, and he feels like an idiot. It’s such a small touch, but Taiga’s hands are cold, and Hokuto wants to grab them and warm them up and-</p><p>“Ouch,” he whines, wiggling his finger before placing it back on the string.</p><p>Taiga makes an empathetic face. “It might be easier if they had given you a guitar with nylon strings - at least the two smallest ones. They’re easier for newbie fingers. But-” he adds like some kind of a comforting afterthought - “the steel strings sound nicer.”</p><p>Hokuto promptly decides he’s going to keep the steel strings even if it kills his fingertips.</p><p>While Hokuto practices switching between the chords he already knows, Taiga draws them on a piece of paper and adds one new chord - G major. If Hokuto frowns at the picture a bit too long and then gladly allows Taiga to maneuver his fingers on their correct places again, well. It’s perfectly understandable, isn’t it? He <i>is</i> trying to acquire a completely new skill here. And Taiga <i>is</i> here to help him.</p><p>His phone vibrates with a new message and something about it reminds him to glance at the clock on the wall. It’s been more than an hour already.</p><p>“I think I’ve got this for now,” he blurts out, suddenly worried. Taiga doesn’t seem too bothered, but he doesn’t want to push it. Taiga might just be too polite to say he’s tired or bored, so Hokuto should probably offer him an easy way out. “You can go home if you want to - I’ll stay for a moment more!”</p><p>Taiga raises his brows. “If you’re sure.”</p><p>“I am!” Hokuto assures him, maybe slightly too eagerly. He has to be firm about it, lest Taiga see his reluctance to let him go for real. “I’ll be just fine for now. I can’t take in anything more today, anyway.”</p><p>“I’ll leave you the notes, then,” Taiga says, starting to pack his things. “And hey, maybe search for an online tuner that you can use anywhere. They’re usually quite passable.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Hokuto says, fiddling with the neck of the guitar. The strings make a funny noise when he drags his fingernails up and down along them. “Look, I’m sorry you have to do this, but. Thank you, really.”</p><p>Taiga looks at him in a strange way. His expression is soft somehow, almost fond even as he rummages around his bag for a new mask. “Will you ever believe me if I say I really don’t mind?”</p><p>Hokuto makes a face. “Probably not.”</p><p>“That sounds like a you problem then,” Taiga says, and Hokuto manages to catch a glimpse of a twisted smile before Taiga’s face is covered behind the mask. “Have a nice weekend. And take care. Wash your hands, cough into your sleeve, and so on.”</p><p>“You too,” Hokuto says, feeling a silly little smile crawling up his own face.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>According to the calendar, the weekend lasts for two days. For Hokuto, it feels more like five, and by Monday morning he is giddy to the point he feels ridiculous about it.</p><p>The altered personal schedules of the three healthy SixTONES members don't match at all, so Hokuto only makes it to the company cafeteria when Kochi is finishing his lunch.</p><p>They have designated seats now, the tables of each group placed in accordance with the national guidelines of physical distancing and separated with temporary see-through plastic screens. That obviously means lots of noise in the cafeteria when the people who want to talk to their friends and colleagues in the other tables have to yell across the room to be heard.</p><p>"Hello stranger," Fuma bellows at Hokuto from the Sexy Zone table, where also Shori and Marius wave hands at him. "Where have you been?"</p><p>"Auditioning for a movie role," Hokuto says, setting his lunch tray on the table next to Kochi. "Can't tell you more about it, but keep your thumbs up for me."</p><p>"Sure will. Just so you know, we're having a contest here, you guys and us. The last man standing from each group treats the other a lunch."</p><p>"I'm still on Kyomoto's side though," Shori points out. Hokuto's heart makes a stupid little flip at the mention of Taiga's name.</p><p>"Taiga was here earlier," Kochi explains. "He said it's pointless, if the both need to buy the other a lunch. He said they could just buy their own lunches if that’s the case."</p><p>"He's got a point there," Hokuto admits.</p><p>"But where's the fun in that!" Fuma moans, "Come on guys!"</p><p>"Just humor him," Marius pleads, looking amused and tired at the same time, "He needs more playmates-"</p><p>"I'm just <i>so bored</i>!"</p><p>"-until Kento and Sou get well."</p><p>"I love you two," Fuma assures Marius, leaning in to squeeze him into a hug and ruffle his hair - exactly the way they aren’t really allowed to do these strange days. "But I'm <i>withering</i> without wider circles of people! Hokuto, you'll hang out with me tomorrow, won't you? We'll wear masks and stay outside, and it will all be perfectly appropriate!"</p><p>“Can’t,” Hokuto says while stuffing his face with the food. “I’m having my guitar lessons tomorrow and the day after.”</p><p>“Not the whole day! I know you guys got your concerts postponed so you’ll have time, and this traitor already refused me!” Fuma says, pouting at Kochi.</p><p>“The whole day,” Hokuto confirms, trying to sound indifferent about it. “I’ll have lessons with Kyomoto.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Kochi says, raising his brows with sudden yet unsurprising curiosity. “I heard Takahashi mention that on Friday. Why’s Taiga teaching you instead of your teacher?”</p><p>“She’s got Covid,” Hokuto says with a shrug. “And apparently Takahashi thought this would be a good idea, so here we go. We’ve got a practice room booked for two whole days. ”</p><p>With all hope lost, Fuma sighs melodramatically and moves on to pester Shori again. Hokuto’s phone vibrates in his pocket. As if he’s aware of having been talked about, it’s Taiga. Hokuto glances around but nobody is paying any attention to him, so he dares to open the message.</p><p>
<i>”Wanna come over to mine tomorrow? Doesn’t really make sense for the both of us to take the trains all the way to the office when we could be much more comfortable here.”</i>
</p><p>Sense, huh? A sensible person would know better and stick to the plan of going to the office. But Hokuto has never been very sensible when it comes to Taiga, has he?</p><p>That’s why he finds himself at Taiga’s doorstep at noon the next day.</p><p>"Hi," Hokuto says when Taiga opens the door.</p><p>It's weird. Whenever Taiga invites everyone over, Hokuto usually asks Kochi for a ride as they come from the approximately same direction. Besides, that way he is never alone at Taiga's doorstep. Like he is now.</p><p>"Hi," Taiga says and lets him in.</p><p>The hallway is a narrow space, and Hokuto is acutely aware of how close they're standing when he tries to toe off his shoes while not dropping the guitar case.</p><p>"Sorry, I'll just. The kettle. Tea," Taiga mumbles as he squeezes past Hokuto, hand brushing across Hokuto's waist as he goes. Startled, Hokuto stares after him.</p><p>It's not that he's not used to being touched - Juri does that literally every time he walks by. It's because it's <i>Taiga</i>. Taiga tends to keep his hands to himself.</p><p>Sadly, he does just that when they move to Taiga's living room and Taiga sits on a pillow at the adjacent side of a low table from.</p><p>"I searched through my shelves and found some music sheets I used when I was just starting to learn," Taiga says, indicating with his hand a pile of dog-eared papers on the table. "Some of them are children's songs and it doesn't hurt you to learn them, too, but there are also some notes for senpai songs that I hoarded back when I was like fourteen. Smap, Arashi, KAT-TUN. That kinda stuff."</p><p>Hokuto leafs through the pile. At first he only looks at the titles of the songs, but soon his attention shifts to the tiny pencil scribbles on the edges of the pages and between the notation lines. He recognizes Taiga's handwriting and it's clear on some of the pages that the writer was a child. There's something adorable, but also humbling, to think that Taiga has spent so many years practicing.</p><p>And now Hokuto himself is supposed to practice for less than two months before standing on the stage next to him.</p><p>"You can borrow them all," Taiga offers. "And no hurry in returning them. Just bring them back when you don't need them anymore."</p><p>It feels like he's been handed some kind of a treasure.</p><p>"Can we start with this one?" Hokuto asks, lifting <i>Happiness</i> by Arashi from the pile. Most of the chords marked above the notes seem to be the same that Taiga taught him the day before.</p><p>Taiga squints at the notes for a while. "Yeah, sure. I was gonna suggest one of the children’s lullabies on the bottom of the pile but we can work with this, too."</p><p>The so-called guitar lesson is more like three lessons packed together, and by dinnertime Hokuto's fingertips are on fire again. He's probably being silly, insisting on not showing Taiga his pain, but he's <i>not</i> going to be a crybaby about it.</p><p>"We'll have to get something to eat from the convenience store next door. I don't have anything prepared," Taiga says as he puts his guitar down and stretches his limbs. "And I really want to get some fresh air."</p><p>Hokuto sighs and puts down his guitar, trying not to feel too discouraged. Hours of practice and he's barely making any progress at all. Yes, he can tune a guitar. Yes, he remembers where his fingers belong in each chord. But no, the switch from one chord to another doesn't seem to get any smoother, and his right hand just can't catch the rhythm.</p><p>Hours, he tries to remind himself. Hours still, not days or months, of practice. He's <i>supposed</i> to be bad at it at this point.</p><p>Taiga is notably chatty on the way to the convenience store and back. Hokuto listens to him, though mostly the words go past his head and he just listens to Taiga's voice. He really likes it. It's nice and soft and easy to the ears. Of course Taiga's speaking voice is each bit as pleasant to listen to, as his singing voice is.</p><p>"-and I was so disappointed when Minoru died!"</p><p>The words catch Hokuto's ears and maybe he was kind of listening to what Taiga was saying, too, as he suddenly realizes he knows what this is about.</p><p>"Wait, you watch my dramas?” he blurts out, feeling a curious mixture of embarrassment and pride.</p><p>“Why's it such a surprise?" Taiga asks lightly. "You knew that already, didn't you?"</p><p>"I guess I did," Hokuto murmurs, feeling his cheeks heat up. It's stupid. Many of his colleagues watch each others' performances. His own group members always go to see each others' stage plays and movies, too.</p><p>Still, the thought of Taiga looking at him with such intense concentration, even on a television screen, makes his stomach flutter again.</p><p>He's such a lost cause.</p><p>After the dinner Taiga boils more water for tea. Hokuto twitches with a sting of pain when he touches the hot tea mug with his tender fingertips. They still have one more hour planned. How he'll survive through it is a mystery. And the next day? He doesn’t even dare to think about it yet.</p><p>He stretches his feet under the table, rolling his ankles around, and accidentally kicks Taiga's foot.</p><p>"Sorry," he says quickly and pulls his feet back, staring at his tea mug.</p><p>Taiga doesn't answer, so he's probably trying to ignore the sudden contact as intensively as Hokuto is. Of course.</p><p>The silence stretches out, slowly filling the whole room. So in the end Hokuto was right, and the guitar lessons were a terrible idea. The day went surprisingly well, but somehow they still managed to make it all awkward in the end.</p><p>He should just go. He could swallow his pride, admit his fingers hurt too much for him to play anymore, and take his leave before it gets worse.</p><p>Taiga's foot bumps against his under the table, and he startles. Then it happens again, and it's definitely not an accident this time.</p><p>Unable to look up, Hokuto holds his breath as Taiga slowly strokes his toes a few times with his foot, before moving further to rub against the protruding ankle bone.</p><p>The intimacy of the small touch tickles at the bottom of Hokuto’s stomach and his mouth suddenly feels dry even though he's been continuously sipping the tea until now. He licks his lips and takes a good long gulp of the cooled-down tea. The movement causes him to look up. Behind his mug Taiga is looking at him, eyes dark and intense.</p><p>Is Taiga...flirting with him?</p><p>Why would he? It doesn’t make any sense.</p><p>Hokuto wants to ask. He wants to demand for an explanation, but the words stick to his throat.</p><p>"Come on, Matsumura. One more lesson," Taiga says in a low voice and stands up.</p><p>It's not an order of course, but it feels very much like one. Fuck tortured fingertips and awkward silences, Hokuto must stay. He must follow Taiga to the living room and sit down with the guitar.</p><p>"Let's try Happiness one more time," Taiga instructs in a matter-of-fact tone, but he's still <i>looking</i> at Hokuto.</p><p>As expected, it's a disaster. If Hokuto had the vaguest of ideas of what to do with his guitar earlier, it's all gone now. His fingers ache, his stomach tries to twist itself into a messy knot, and his heart skips a beat every time Taiga touches his hands to guide him.</p><p>"The rhythm is off," Taiga says, as if Hokuto doesn't know that. He's used to being in control of what his right hand does, but it seems to have degraded into the motor abilities of a three-year-old.</p><p>"May I show you?" Taiga asks, and Hokuto is about to hand the guitar to him when Taiga scoots over and behind him, his chest pressing against Hokuto's back as he reaches around Hokuto's body to slowly guide his right hand to the correct rhythm.</p><p>Startled, Hokuto glances across his shoulder just to see Taiga's face so close to his own that if they wanted to kiss, they would just need to lean in, and Hokuto <i>wants</i> to kiss Taiga so badly, his body vibrates with it.</p><p>Taiga's hand, the one covering Hokuto's on the guitar strings, is sweaty and slightly shaky. Hokuto feels a heartbeat, but he isn’t sure which one of them it belongs to.</p><p>They move in to close the distance between them at the same time.</p><p>The position is awkward and honestly a bit painful with how much Hokuto needs to twist his neck, but Taiga's lips are soft and eager, and Hokuto <i>wants him</i>.</p><p>The guitar makes an echoy noise when Hokuto drops it to the floor and wriggles around in Taiga's arms so he reaches Taiga's mouth more comfortably. Taiga holds him firmly close by the waist, like he's determined not to let Hokuto go now that he's finally caught him.</p><p>So maybe Hokuto has been a bit of an idiot.</p><p>They kiss and kiss until the both are out of breath. For a little while Hokuto rests his head against Taiga's, his forehead to Taiga's cheek.</p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p>He looks up at Taiga's murmur. “Hmm?”</p><p>"You could stay for the night."</p><p>His breath catches in a sharp exhale. But. Yeah. “I could.”</p><p>Taiga's face spreads into a beautiful smile, and he pulls Hokuto into another deep, hungry kiss. At the same time he runs his hands along Hokuto's back and sides, eventually slipping them under the hem of Hokuto's sweater and t-shirt. His fingers seem to be chronically cold, but they are strong and their touch is firm, and he drags them so deliciously on Hokuto's bare skin that Hokuto shivers and hums with pleasure.</p><p>It still doesn't make any sense. So Taiga wants him too? Since when he does, and how it's possible eludes him, but he isn't going to stop and question it.</p><p>"Come on," Taiga whispers and stands up. Hokuto's whole being resists letting go of him, but then Taiga takes his hand and pulls him up go his feet. He kisses Hokuto again, sweet and hasty, and leads them into his bedroom.</p><p>Ready to comply with anything, Hokuto lets Taiga push him to sit on the edge of the bed, and leans backwards, hands back on the mattress, when Taiga crawls in to sit on his lap. Taiga immediately leans in to kiss Hokuto's temple, moving slowly down to his earlobe and neck. Hokuto tilts his head, speechless with want and arousal as Taiga's warm, wet lips and tongue leave his skin tingling everywhere they touch.</p><p>Hokuto's hips want to move on their own, aching for any friction to his crotch, and when he deliberately rolls his hips up against Taiga's, he finds Taiga just as hard as he is already. He wants to touch more.</p><p>Supporting himself with just one hand, he slips the other hand down between them to rub his palm against Taiga’s crotch through his sweatpants. The needy whimper that Taiga lets out against his neck makes cold shivers run down his spine and raises his skin to goose bumps, and he keeps on moving his hand just so he can hear that sound again and again.</p><p>The room is warm and they're starting to get sweaty, and suddenly Hokuto can't stand to be wearing any clothes at all. He pulls off his both shirts at the same time, and moves on to fumble at the buttons of Taiga's flannel. Taiga straightens up, quietly looking at Hokuto as he allows him to open the buttons.</p><p>Having undone them all, Hokuto slides the flannel off Taiga's shoulders and pulls off the black t-shirt underneath. He can hardly take his eyes off of Taiga. He's seen Taiga shirtless, naked even, a million times, but this time is completely different to all those occasions, because this time he gets to undress Taiga by himself, marveling at the smoothness of Taiga's pale skin and the way Taiga's body arches against his when his palms travel up and down Taiga's back and sides.</p><p>Taiga's own hands wander across Hokuto's bare chest, shoulders, and back as well, and somehow they manage to move so that neither one is at the other's way. Hokuto’s skin feels like it’s burning, but in a good way. No, the <i>best</i> way. He still doesn't know what exactly it is that Taiga wants, but just in case this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, he is determined to make the most out of it.</p><p>"Wanna take these off?" Taiga murmurs, gently tucking at the waist of Hokuto's jeans. Initially speechless, Hokuto nods him a permission, and Taiga goes to open the button and the zipper.</p><p>"Take off yours, too," Hokuto manages as Taiga stands up to pull Hokuto’s loose jeans off to the floor. At the request, Taiga drops down both his joggers and boxers at once, and Hokuto hurries to get rid of his own boxers as well.</p><p>For a small moment they simply observe at each other, and it's weirdly easy in a way Hokuto could never have believed. Then Taiga locks his eyes with Hokuto's and, without breaking the eye contact, drops to his knees.</p><p>"Do we need a condom for this?" Taiga asks as he pushes Hokuto's legs open and settles between them.</p><p>"Not unless you want to," Hokuto says, trying to act calm and mature despite his nerves screaming with what he thinks - hopes - is about to happen. "I got myself tested after the last time I was with someone."</p><p>"Same here." Taiga's small smile is adorable and arousing at the same time when he wraps his cool fingers around Hokuto's cock. Hokuto gasps, his eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>"What responsible adults we've grown up to be," he manages. Then the wonderful, hot wetness of Taiga's mouth surrounds him, and his breath catches. It's so, so, <i>so</i> good.</p><p>He forces himself to open his eyes because he wants to see this properly.</p><p>Taiga's hair has fallen to cover his eyes, and Hokuto gently combs it back. Taiga glances up at him and does something wonderful with his tongue. Hokuto's shaky breathing seems to encourage him, and he moves his hand in a rhythm with his head.</p><p>Hokuto strokes Taiga's hair at his neck, fingertips combing through the soft baby hair. He's careful not to push or pull with his hand, just guiding Taiga gently towards the rhythm that feels the best.</p><p>When Taiga pulls back to relax his jaw and lick his lips, Hokuto grabs his arms and pulls him up into his lap again so he can kiss Taiga hard and deep. Taiga answers eagerly, wrapping his arms around Hokuto's neck and pressing close to him. Hokuto isn't sure if he's bucking his hips up on purpose or if they're moving on their own, but Taiga is still as hard as he was before, and Hokuto feels weak at the knees even though he’s still sitting. The thought of Taiga finding this so arousing is making his head spin.</p><p>Holding on firmly, he leans back, pulling Taiga along until they're lying down chest to chest. His eyes meet Taiga's and he smirks, and rolls around so he is the one on top, looking down at Taiga.</p><p>"This okay?" he checks, and Taiga's frantic nod is enough of an answer.</p><p>Hokuto kisses him again. He licks into Taiga's mouth, nibbles on his lower lip, and trails down towards Taiga's ear. Taiga sighs contently and tilts his head, giving Hokuto more room to kiss his neck and shoulder.</p><p>Planting kisses all along Taiga's skin from his collar bones to his chest and to his belly, Hokuto slowly moves downward. He fumbles around for Taiga's hand, and upon finding it, presses it against his own head until Taiga gets the hint and tangles his fingers into Hokuto's hair.</p><p>Hokuto slowly kisses his way lower, stopping just above Taiga's cock, waiting for Taiga to stop or encourage him. The way Taiga nudges Hokuto's head is unambiguous, so he leans down to lick up along the shaft and twirl his tongue around the head a few times before he closes the whole head into his mouth.</p><p>Taiga inhales sharply and drops his head to the mattress, and his audible, visible pleasure makes Hokuto's own need even stronger. Funny how badly one can long for somebody when already having both his hands <i>and</i> his mouth on them.</p><p>Hokuto closes his eyes and listens, making sure to save each moan and whimper deep into his memory. Taiga doesn’t really guide Hokuto’s head with his hand but he holds on to him and that, too, feels so good.</p><p>When Hokuto withdraws for a breather, Taiga presses his hand on Hokuto’s cheek, prompting him to look up.</p><p>“Have you ever fucked a guy?”</p><p>Taiga’s voice is quiet but there is an urgency in his tone that makes Hokuto’s heart race.</p><p>“Many times enough to know what I’m doing now,” he rasps, and Taiga’s eyes twinkle with anticipation.</p><p>“Then do it.”</p><p>The words are so simple, yet Hokuto can hardly believe he’s hearing them.</p><p>“Here,” Taiga says, reaching to his side to get a tube of lube from under his pillow. Does he always sleep with it? Maybe he left it there on purpose? But then- was he planning for this all the time? Hokuto wonders about it again as he accepts the tube and pours some of the gel on his fingers. Taiga wriggles himself into a better position, lifts his knees up and spreads his legs open, and Hokuto has to take a long, slow breath so he doesn’t come immediately like an excited teenager.</p><p>He can only marvel at how willing and responsive Taiga is under his touch, moving his hips against Hokuto’s fingers and openly taking his pleasure from Hokuto’s touch. And when Taiga decides he is ready, he sits up to switch their places again, pushing Hokuto to lie on the bed.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re fine without a condom?” Hokuto gasps when Taiga straddles him. “It’s- it’s gonna be messy.”</p><p>Taiga’s smile is sly when he grabs the tube of lube and pours a liberal amount of the gel on Hokuto’s cock. “I know.”</p><p>He straightens up and guides Hokuto inside.</p><p>Holding his hands lightly on Taiga’s waist, Hokuto concentrates hard so he stays still, letting both Taiga and himself get used to the feeling. Taiga’s eyes are wide and his mouth slightly open when their eyes meet. He’s beautiful.</p><p>Hokuto strokes Taiga’s skin with his thumbs. “You feeling okay?”</p><p>Taiga’s laughter is short and breathy. “Yeah. Feels good.” He rolls his hips a couple times before leaning down to kiss Hokuto and whisper against his lips: “You said you know what to do. Show me?”</p><p>Despite his request to be shown things, Taiga doesn’t just float with it. Instead, he moves against Hokuto just as eagerly, and with the way he keeps staring into Hokuto’s eyes, he <i>must</i> know he looks smoldering good like this.</p><p>In a sudden impulse, Hokuto puts his hand on the side of Taiga’s face, gently brushing across his lips with his thumb. Taiga closes his eyes and rubs his cheek and neck against Hokuto’s palm. It's such a sweet moment in the middle of it all, Hokuto's heart squeezes of it, and he can only hope Taiga is feeling something similar.</p><p>It doesn’t take long after that.</p><p>“Gonna cum,” Hokuto groans. Taiga immediately relaxes his body, not trying to actively meet Hokuto’s movements by his own effort anymore, but instead just pliantly conforming to Hokuto’s rhythm, letting Hokuto set the pace as he bucks up into Taiga. They both moan with pleasure when Hokuto spills himself inside.</p><p>Feeling fuzzy and relaxed and gasping for breath, Hokuto tries to gather himself together. “I’ll help you in a second,” he pants, letting his head loll to the side and closing his eyes for a moment.</p><p>“I’ll help myself if you watch me,” Taiga says and grabs himself, moving his hand with fast strokes until he cums on Hokuto’s stomach. Hokuto never wants to forget how Taiga looks like when he reaches his own peak. Watching Taiga pleasure himself while Hokuto is still buried deep inside him tops all his previous imaginations tenfold.</p><p>“You’re beautiful.” Hokuto can’t stop the words before they’re already out. He’s being sappy and he knows it. But then, it's true.</p><p>“And you’re ridiculous,” Taiga snorts, but his tone is soft and affectionate. He lifts himself up, rolls to Hokuto’s side, and kisses him. Hokuto kisses him back and tries not to think about the mess that Taiga moving around will create on the sheets. The thought is slightly disgusting but mostly arousing, and he has to reach around Taiga’s behind to sweep his fingers between Taiga’s buttocks, just to feel it.</p><p>“Stop it, you dork,” Taiga snaps, still in that wonderfully affectionate tone as he swats Hokuto’s hand away and curls up to his side, head resting on Hokuto’s arm. “If you start doing that, I’ll start wanting for another round, and I really, really need to sleep now!”</p><p>“Would it be so bad?” Hokuto jokes - though it’s only half a joke - and wriggles around until they both have a comfortable place.</p><p>“<i>Yes</i> it would. We’ve got a long day tomorrow. I promised Takahashi I’d make a proper guitarist out of you. Why else did you think we’ve got these two whole days all for ourselves?”</p><p>“He asked you to help me, and <i>this</i> is how you do it?” Hokuto asks, incredulous. Taiga’s silence is extremely pointed. “Wait, he did ask you, didn’t he?”</p><p>“He mentioned Ito-sensei being sick, and I figured you’d need a teacher.”</p><p>Hokuto frowns, trying to pull the strings together. Then it dawns to him. “You arranged this whole thing,” he says, and winces at how much it sounds like an accusation. ”<i>You</i> asked to give lessons to me.”</p><p>“To be fair, I am not to blame for Juri, Shintaro, and Jesse’s illness and the postponing of the concerts. They got that all by themselves. I just. Saw an opportunity and took it. Now shut up and sleep before I throw you out to the couch.”</p><p>Hokuto wouldn’t let that happen over his dead body. Instead, he steals one more kiss and resigns himself to the fact that the next morning they’re going to have a long, awkward conversation about what the hell is going on between them from now on.</p><p>But that’s for tomorrow.</p><p>“The lights,” he only points out as he closes his eyes.</p><p>“I’ll need to go to the bathroom in like five minutes,” Taiga murmurs reluctantly, nose pressed against Hokuto’s chest. “I’ll put them out then.”</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>The next day isn’t exactly great for either of them.</p><p>Hokuto’s sore fingertips get achy even faster than they did the day before, and when he finally lets go of his pride and complains about the pain a lot, Taiga comes dangerously close to the limits of his patience with Hokuto several times. And the long, awkward conversation which Hokuto predicted. It’s, well. Exactly that. But in the end they somehow manage to stumble into an agreement along the lines of <i>I like you, you like me, last night was good, so we should probably keep on doing this permanently</i>.</p><p>“You’re lucky you're so hot,” Taiga huffs at some point in the afternoon, a pencil in his hand as he tries to draw another version of the chords that Hokuto will somehow be able to read properly. “Otherwise I'd have kicked you out already. You’d better appreciate all the shit I do for you.”</p><p>“All this shit that you willingly got yourself into,” Hokuto reminds Taiga, his brows up and a smile tucking at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Don’t test my limits, Matsumura,” Taiga warns him. Then he grabs the front of Hokuto’s sweater and pulls him into a deep, intense kiss.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>Two months later, their duet in Shonen Club is at least passable if not exactly marvelous. When the last chords echo in the concert hall and the fans scream their applauds, Hokuto meets Taiga's eyes. The look in them is equally relieved and proud, and for a moment Hokuto basks in the feeling of having accomplished something amazing.</p><p>The wondeful feeling of success only lasts for that one night though. The next morning, just before their dance practice, he gets a text message from the director of Kyrie no uta. The actual episode won't even come out on television in weeks, but somehow he's already seen the raw video material of Hokuto’s performance on Shonen Club and demands that Hokuto <i>must</i> play the guitar live on the promotional tour of the movie, too.</p><p>Lost into the sinking feeling of desperation mixed with resignation, he startles when Taiga suddenly appears behind him and rests his chin against Hokuto's shoulder so he can see the message that made Hokuto go so pale in the face.</p><p>“Looks like someone here will need more lessons,” Taiga murmurs into Hokuto's ear. "Many, many more."</p>
