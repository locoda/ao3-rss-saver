    <h2 class="toc-heading">Stop this wedding!</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="justify">
  <span>There are times when Kyomoto Taiga regrets some of the decisions he had made in his life so far.  As he dragged his luggage towards yet another hotel for a sudden “vacation” or as Jesse would like to call it, Taiga regretted that he was best friends with someone who loved to travel. Jesse swore there was a reason for this vacation this time and Taiga, for the life of him, of course, believed his best friend yet again. To get Jesse off his back even just on the way there, Taiga busied himself with replying to emails for work and reading over briefings as he was already sure that once they got to where Jesse planned to go, he won’t have time to check up on his company anymore.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Matsumura Hokuto kept his circle small but being best friends with Kochi Yugo already filled up what little time he spared not working on anything. Luckily, his work allowed him to travel around whenever Yugo asked him to go on one spontaneous trip after another. Only this time, Yugo was vague as to the reason why he suddenly wanted to travel.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“<strong>YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED?!</strong>” Taiga and Hokuto said at the same time. It was their first time meeting but their reactions already matched each other’s up to the tone.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their friends smiled widely and nodded in response.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So, you drag my ass from Tokyo to Nagoya to have dinner with your boyfriend and his best friend and drop the bomb that you’re getting married?!” Taiga leaned back in his seat and sighed, he could not even look directly at his friend right now.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But… Yugo, you’ve only been dating for three months.” Hokuto did not even think to filter his thoughts. “Are you even sure you know him that well?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We want to get married in no later than three months,” Yugo said instead of addressing what Hokuto had just said. He reached for Jesse’s hand and gazed at him lovingly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“When you know, you know.” Jesse pulled up their linked hands and kissed the back of Yugo’s hand. “Why wait for long if we already know we want to make a promise to each other, you know?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Jesse and Yugo gazed lovingly at each other as though it was just them inside the private room they had reserved for their dinner. Taiga made a disgusted gagging sound while Hokuto chugged down the contents of his water glass.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Listen, Jesse, I know you’ve told me countless of times how hopelessly in love and devoted you are to Yugo,” Taiga faced Yugo. “Don’t get me wrong, Yugo, okay? I love you and I think you’re a good person. But isn’t this going too fast? You’ve only known each other three months.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And we have a lifetime to get to know each other better.” Jesse countered. “I thought you would be happy for me. I was set on asking you to be my best man.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And you’ll be mine, Hokuto.” Yugo said. “We were really looking forward to telling the two of you first. This is the first of many trips we’ll have together as we plan things leading up to the wedding."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto jumped on his heel when Taiga suddenly entered his hotel room right before the door closed behind him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"We have got to stop this wedding," Taiga said as he took off his shoes and changed into the hotel's complimentary slippers.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You can come in by the way," Hokuto said as he followed Taiga inside.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Nice suite," Taiga commented before sitting down. "I know you're as against this marriage as I am. Don't get me wrong, okay? Your best friend is a nice guy, probably the best one Jesse ever introduced to me. But three months of dating? Seriously?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I know!" Hokuto sat at the chair adjacent to the sofa where Taiga was seated. "I've seen them together after third wheeling with them on their dates and I know they make each other happy but marriage?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Good, we're on the same page then." Taiga smiled at Hokuto. He leaned back on the sofa for a more comfortable position. "So, you need to tell me everything that Yugo dislikes and I'll tell you Jesse's. Let's devise a plan on how we can indirectly stop this."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Can't it wait for tomorrow? It's getting late." Hokuto said. “I… I need to do my skin care and get enough rest.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga raised an eyebrow, he looked at Hokuto from his head to his foot. “Ah, I guess keeping up with your skin takes a while, huh? But did you know we’re visiting jewelers tomorrow? As if there aren’t enough choices in Tokyo already.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto let out a frustrated sigh. “Why do they need to do that when I can so easily design rings that would be unique for them? This does not taste well in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Are you a jeweler?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto shook his head. “I’m a designer. What do you do?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I manage a chain of shopping malls. Maybe if our alliance this time works well, we can arrange to work on other things too.” Taiga stood up. “I won’t keep you long anymore. I’ll see you at breakfast before we meet those two again.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Wait -”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Good night, Matsumura-san.” Taiga went out of the room without hearing Hokuto out.</span>
