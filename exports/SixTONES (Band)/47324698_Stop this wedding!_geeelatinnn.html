<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="justify">
  <span>There are times when Kyomoto Taiga regrets some of the decisions he had made in his life so far.  As he dragged his luggage towards yet another hotel for a sudden “vacation” or as Jesse would like to call it, Taiga regretted that he was best friends with someone who loved to travel. Jesse swore there was a reason for this vacation this time and Taiga, for the life of him, of course, believed his best friend yet again. To get Jesse off his back even just on the way there, Taiga busied himself with replying to emails for work and reading over briefings as he was already sure that once they got to where Jesse planned to go, he won’t have time to check up on his company anymore.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Matsumura Hokuto kept his circle small but being best friends with Kochi Yugo already filled up what little time he spared not working on anything. Luckily, his work allowed him to travel around whenever Yugo asked him to go on one spontaneous trip after another. Only this time, Yugo was vague as to the reason why he suddenly wanted to travel.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“<strong>YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED?!</strong>” Taiga and Hokuto said at the same time. It was their first time meeting but their reactions already matched each other’s up to the tone.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Their friends smiled widely and nodded in response.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So, you drag my ass from Tokyo to Nagoya to have dinner with your boyfriend and his best friend and drop the bomb that you’re getting married?!” Taiga leaned back in his seat and sighed, he could not even look directly at his friend right now.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But… Yugo, you’ve only been dating for three months.” Hokuto did not even think to filter his thoughts. “Are you even sure you know him that well?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We want to get married in no later than three months,” Yugo said instead of addressing what Hokuto had just said. He reached for Jesse’s hand and gazed at him lovingly.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“When you know, you know.” Jesse pulled up their linked hands and kissed the back of Yugo’s hand. “Why wait for long if we already know we want to make a promise to each other, you know?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Jesse and Yugo gazed lovingly at each other as though it was just them inside the private room they had reserved for their dinner. Taiga made a disgusted gagging sound while Hokuto chugged down the contents of his water glass.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Listen, Jesse, I know you’ve told me countless of times how hopelessly in love and devoted you are to Yugo,” Taiga faced Yugo. “Don’t get me wrong, Yugo, okay? I love you and I think you’re a good person. But isn’t this going too fast? You’ve only known each other three months.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And we have a lifetime to get to know each other better.” Jesse countered. “I thought you would be happy for me. I was set on asking you to be my best man.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And you’ll be mine, Hokuto.” Yugo said. “We were really looking forward to telling the two of you first. This is the first of many trips we’ll have together as we plan things leading up to the wedding."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto jumped on his heel when Taiga suddenly entered his hotel room right before the door closed behind him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"We have got to stop this wedding," Taiga said as he took off his shoes and changed into the hotel's complimentary slippers.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You can come in by the way," Hokuto said as he followed Taiga inside.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Nice suite," Taiga commented before sitting down. "I know you're as against this marriage as I am. Don't get me wrong, okay? Your best friend is a nice guy, probably the best one Jesse ever introduced to me. But three months of dating? Seriously?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I know!" Hokuto sat at the chair adjacent to the sofa where Taiga was seated. "I've seen them together after third wheeling with them on their dates and I know they make each other happy but marriage?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Good, we're on the same page then." Taiga smiled at Hokuto. He leaned back on the sofa for a more comfortable position. "So, you need to tell me everything that Yugo dislikes and I'll tell you Jesse's. Let's devise a plan on how we can indirectly stop this."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Can't it wait for tomorrow? It's getting late." Hokuto said. “I… I need to do my skin care and get enough rest.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga raised an eyebrow, he looked at Hokuto from his head to his foot. “Ah, I guess keeping up with your skin takes a while, huh? But did you know we’re visiting jewelers tomorrow? As if there aren’t enough choices in Tokyo already.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto let out a frustrated sigh. “Why do they need to do that when I can so easily design rings that would be unique for them? This does not taste well in my mouth.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Are you a jeweler?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto shook his head. “I’m a designer. What do you do?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I manage a chain of shopping malls. Maybe if our alliance this time works well, we can arrange to work on other things too.” Taiga stood up. “I won’t keep you long anymore. I’ll see you at breakfast before we meet those two again.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Wait -”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Good night, Matsumura-san.” Taiga went out of the room without hearing Hokuto out.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Hokuto was still a bit tired from the long drive he and Yugo had yesterday from Tokyo to Nagoya but his body insisted on waking up at the same hour he always wakes up. He hopped into the shower, hoping this would jolt his body awake. Thankfully, the hotel had an option for hot water option and the hot water really did a good job of relaxing his muscles. He was still a little sleepy by the time he was wrapping up the towel around him but he knew it was not something a breakfast and a hot drink won’t be able to fix.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as he stepped out of the bathroom, there was a knock on his hotel room door. Without a second thought, he walked to answer it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow.” Taiga said at the other side of the door, looking at Hokuto’s naked upper body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit,” Hokuto let go of the door and walked back inside. “Come in,” He said while walking in the direction of the bedroom door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do remember we decided to meet for breakfast before we meet up with the two idiots, right?” Taiga said in a loud enough voice for Hokuto to hear while he dressed inside the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had left the door slightly ajar in his hurry that he could clearly hear what Taiga had said. “I remember. But I didn’t know you would be here so early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga scoffed. “Why? Were you expecting someone else this early that you answer the door wearing only a towel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Hokuto violently reacted. “I was merely caught off guard. I wasn’t waiting for anyone else but you, I swear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga let out a hearty laugh. “Relax. You don’t have to take it so seriously. Anyway, do you want to take advantage of the hotel’s buffet breakfast or do you want to eat somewhere else? I know some good places around here.” Taiga spoke while typing something on his iPad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto emerged from the room fully dressed in comfortable clothes as he had no idea what the day would have in store for him. Judging from the announcement they got last night, he knew unexpected things could happen to them anytime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go somewhere good? It’s not every day I get dragged to Nagoya out of the blue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga looked at Hokuto from head to foot before he stood up from the sofa. “Not bad. As expected, a designer knows how to dress himself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto only now notices how relaxed the clothes Taiga was wearing was. Taiga was dressed in straight-cut jeans, a plain white shirt (Hokuto could not tell if it was short or long-sleeved), black sneakers, and a black jacket. You wouldn’t even think that he was the owner of chains of department stores if you see him from afar. Up close though, if you’re someone who was knowledgeable about designer brands, you’d know that what Taiga was wearing was expensive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had always thought that he was someone that looked capable enough to care for himself. He had always been seen as someone who was capable. That was until he had to walk with Taiga from his hotel room to a cafe. Taiga somehow exuded the aura that he was in control, without even saying anything directly. Hokuto felt that Taiga’s hand was hovering at the small of his back when they were getting on the elevator and yet again when they were getting off. Taiga walked on the side of the sidewalk closer to the road. When there was a group of rowdy teenagers jogging and were approaching their direction, Taiga pulled Hokuto by his waist to get him away from the track of the teenagers. Taiga swerved Hokuto back when there were lesser people on the road.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga was even the one who talked to the waitress to get them a good table for two at the cafe. Basically, Hokuto had done nothing but walk beside Taiga the entire time since they left their hotel room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Order whatever you want and don’t hold back. I’ll pay for the whole bill later.” Taiga said as they were handed the menus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, no. It’s okay. I can pay for my share.” Hokuto said but he was met with Taiga merely raising his eyebrow at him. He put up the menu to cover his flustered face. “If you say so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While waiting for their food to be served, Taiga handed Hokuto his iPad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those are just some details about Jesse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Some?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hokuto said in his head as he scrolled through the document that Taiga had opened on his iPad. It was a detailed list of information about Jesse sorted out into different headings. From his basic info down to some trivial things. It gave Hokuto the impression that Taiga does not do things half-heartedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can just follow the same format for Yugo’s information. Put as much as you can remember. No pressure though, we’re meeting them later after all to look around at jewelers and I don’t really know what else since I tuned them out during dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m still a bit sour that they’d rather have someone else’s designs for their rings instead of asking me for it.” Hokuto pouted. “Well, I did only found out that they were planning to get married.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga snapped his fingers. “That’s it! Continue sulking like that later. Jesse’s weak against that kind of things and maybe Yugo will feel bad they’d ask you to design their rings. If they do, keep delaying it. Don’t show them a design even if you’ve made one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What good will it do? There are other things they need other than rings anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it is one thing. And maybe Jesse might say something bad about you while being impatient about the design and then of course Yugo will come to your rescue. I don’t know too but at least it’s something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto put down the iPad when their food was served. “I’m sorry but it might take me some time to do Yugo’s part.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay. We won’t be using everything all at once anyway. We may be doing some trivial things but so long as it at least delays their wedding then we’re good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does this mean we’ll have to see each other often?” Hokuto clasped his hand over his mouth when he realized he just blurted his thoughts out loud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why? Are you looking forward to seeing me often?” Taiga rested his chin on his palm and watched for Hokuto’s reaction with a smile on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-no. Tha-that’s not what I meant. I just… I just meant, you know with all the plotting to stop or delay the wedding and all that.” Hokuto sighed defeatedly and closed his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga chuckled. “You have got to learn to relax around me. We are going to see each other often, maybe even communicate often because of all of this. Not just the plotting to stop or delay it but I just know those two would be dragging us along with the preparations as well. If you’re not comfortable meeting me without the other two, just tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay. I just… like you said. I just need to relax. Sorry, I’m a little awkward around newly met people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga shrugged his shoulder. “That’s alright. Your reactions are adorable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto felt his face getting hot. He looked down to focus his attention on his food for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There you guys are,” the familiar voice of Yugo said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto felt relieved that Yugo and Jesse now joined them at the table but he felt Taiga’s eyes on him before their table was yet again offered the menu.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice choice for breakfast, Taiga.” Jesse said. “I liked the food here last time we visited.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Jes, I can’t decide on which one I want. The Salisbury steak or the shrimp scampi with pasta.” Yugo said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Order both, we can just have half each so you can try both dishes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga cleared his throat to remind the couple they were sharing a table with them. “Would you guys just want a table of your own?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh come on, Taiga.” Jesse nudged his shoulder. “You have to get used to it. We also need to talk to you guys about wedding preparation things. If you want, I heard Hokuto’s very single. You can flirt with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto looked up from his food and his eyes met with Taiga’s as the older’s attention turned from Jesse to Hokuto. Taiga winked at Hokuto and chuckled when the younger one choked and had to reach for his glass of water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Told you that you have to relax around me. These two are sure to drag us everywhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <span>Taiga was right. Despite Jesse and Yugo walking around and talking as if they were in their own little bubble, the two still insisted that Hokuto and Taiga come with them. Partly because they wanted to have the option of having someone take their pictures but then again, Taiga and Jesse were more knowledgeable about the shops in the area having to have studied the area for possible expansion of Taiga’s shopping mall before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come here,” Taiga gently pulled Hokuto by his shoulder so they would be walking side by side. “Why do you insist on walking next to Yugo when all his attention is on Jesse?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” was all Hokuto could say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The more they talk, the more likely someone brings up something that would piss the other one off. So let them be.” Taiga pulled Hokuto's arm to stop their tracks. "Let's walk a few paces away from them. They shouldn't hear that we're trying to get them to fight. I'm also getting nauseated by them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Do you not often go out with them, Kyomoto-san?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga. Don't be so formal. I've had enough of that at work." Taiga said as he inserted his hands inside the pockets of his jacket. "I do often go out with them. That's why I know Yugo's a good person and he'll be really good for Jesse. But a wedding? They should at least try to live together before deciding on that. Can I just call you Hokuto? Matsumura's a bit of a mouthful."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded. "They are really good to each other."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga clicked his tongue. "Let's not look at them too much. The tables might turn and we start supporting this wedding."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That traitor!" Hokuto said when he saw Yugo and Jesse enter a shop for tailor-made suits. "Right in my face."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga laughed. Hokuto had only heard it a couple of times but he felt like it could be his favorite sound with how carefree Taiga looks and sounds when he laughs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Relax. He might just be checking things out. Not everyone would know fabrics and design as well as you, you know?"</span>

  <p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto laid down on his bead. He pulled up Taiga’s contact details on his phone and stared at it. Taiga was kind enough to give him a ride from Nagoya to Tokyo when Jesse and Yugo decided to stay one more day. The ride back to Tokyo was spent in silence. Taiga was answering emails on his laptop. The driver did not start any conversation which made Hokuto think that maybe this was how Taiga usually spent his rides, in silence, while answering to things related to his work. Hokuto was not really sure where to place Taiga. On one hand, Taiga seemed just as workaholic as he was but on another, he didn’t even notice Taiga pulling up his phone aside from taking pictures while they were walking around with Jesse and Yugo.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto closed his eyes and scrunched up his nose in embarrassment when he remembered what happened after Taiga smoothly asked for them to exchange contacts before he got off the car. If there was one thing Hokuto would like to remove from his memory of the past weekend, it was his very awkward wave of goodbye before Taiga closed the window of the car.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>When he opened his eyes, his phone started ringing. Taiga was calling him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto sat up from his bed and answered the call. "Hello?"</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, did I wake you?" Taiga asked.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Ah, no, no. I just finished my skincare routine."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Are you free for lunch tomorrow?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto was not really working a normal eight-to-five work and pretty much had his time on his hands. He is however in the middle of conceptualizing a Spring collection but he could spare a few hours to meet with people.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I am. Are we meeting up with Jesse and Yugo?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"No, silly." Taiga laughed on the other line. "I read over the Yugo facts you placed in my document. I was thinking we could take over things more over a meal."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Oh, sure." Hokuto bit down on his lip to stop himself from smiling. "Where would you want to meet?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"My secretary would arrange for the reservation. I'll send you the details tomorrow. Good night, Hokuto."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Good night, Taiga."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto got to the restaurant before Taiga did. He was shown to their seat when he mentioned Taiga's reservation to the receptionist. He did not expect that the reservation would be at Tokyo Sky Tree. It was just a little over their opening time and not a lot of customers were in yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The table started to fill up while he waited for Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I'm sorry, I'm late. I got caught up in a meeting." Taiga said when he arrived a little over fifteen minutes past their agreed time. He took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It's okay. I'm in no rush."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto had spent a good two days with Taiga in his casual clothes and he already thought that Taiga was attractive. But now, seeing Taiga in his work attire, a powder blue polo that fits him perfectly with a navy blue vest over it, a simple black tie, and his hair swept back put Hokuto in a daze.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga snapped his finger in front of Hokuto. “You’re stuck in a daze. Are you that hungry?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Sorry.” Hokuto cleared his throat. He reached for his glass of water just to keep his mouth occupied otherwise he might say something that was not appropriate in the setting. “We should order first. Your work must have tired you out.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Day three and you’re already so concerned about me, huh?” Taiga flipped through the menu.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto put up the menu a little to cover his face, he felt his cheek heat up. He convinced himself that Taiga was just kidding around to lighten up the mood between them. Hokuto had not known Taiga for long, he can’t tell for certain what the other was up to.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga looked at his watch and let out a defeated sigh.  Hokuto sensed that Taiga was running a tight schedule as they got started on discussing things while waiting for their food. Their conversation flowed smoothly, there was already a sense that they were comfortable with communicating with each other. They laughed at how silly some of the antics they thought about were and how petty some ideas seemed to be. But Taiga made it clear to Hokuto that his goal was only to delay the wedding and not to completely tore apart Jesse and Yugo.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is your work around the area?” Taiga asked as he was handed the receipt by the waiter. “I can drop you off before my next appointment.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto waved his hand to refuse Taiga. “It seems like you have a packed schedule since you kept looking at your watch.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I have to get as much done before Jesse drags me to travel again.” Taiga said as he rolled down his sleeves again. “How about you? Will you be okay travelling around all the time?”</span>

  <span>“It helps that I work for a family-managed business. Besides, I already have so little friends. The most I can do is be a good one to my best friend.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Do you want to be friends with me?” Taiga asked as they got on the elevator.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah,” Hokuto answered without a second. “I mean,” he cleared his throat. “Our best friends are dating. We’ll see each other a lot. But if you don’t want to-”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Who said I didn’t want to? I was the one who asked. You’re very interesting Hokuto. I look forward to more meetings with you.” The elevator door opened and someone was already waiting for Taiga to get off. The man bowed his head a little to acknowledge Hokuto’s presence before he spoke to Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga looked back at Hokuto and waved goodbye before completely giving his attention to the person next to him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>When Hokuto got back to his personal room at his studio, Yugo was there, seated at his chair and flipping through his sketchbook.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I was wondering where you were. I was supposed to surprise you and take you to lunch but I was the one who got surprised that you weren't here." Yugo closed the book and leaned back on Hokuto's seat. "Where were you? If you had prior plans I would have known one way or another otherwise I'll find you here."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I went to eat lunch and had a walk to refresh my mind." Hokuto kept a straight face as he talked. He sat at the sofa in the far right corner of his office and tried to look as relaxed as possible so Yugo wouldn't catch his lie.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You? You walking around during winter? The boy who easily gets cold and has to wear layers of clothing walked around the streets in winter?" Yugo crossed his arms.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Enough about me. Why are you really here? Didn't you just got back from Nagoya?" Hokuto tried to keep himself together and talked straight to change the subject.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I could sense that you're not exactly thrilled about my wedding." Yugo talked in a light tone, enough to show that he was not there to fight with Hokuto.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Because I feel that you're moving too fast." Hokuto admitted.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You should get laid."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What the hell?" Hokuto's eyebrows are knitted together. "What does that have to do with anything? When did you start talking like that?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yugo laughed. "I just think that maybe a more straightforward approach would work for you. Of course, you won't understand why I want to get married with someone, you're married to your fashion line. You haven't dated since we stepped out of college. I think you might be lacking some physical touch if you get what I mean."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Get out of my chair. I need to work.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yugo stood up. “When are you going to take my measurements for my wedding suit?”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“When you finally ask, that’s when.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga’s phone kept on ringing but every time it did, it was always Jesse’s caller ID. Taiga chose to ignore it, hoping that at some point Jesse would just give up. It was already dark outside, he had sent his secretary home, and he was pretty much sure he was the only one left in the building. Taiga buried himself in his work, full attention on the figures in front of him. While his business was thriving, he still wanted to expand it. Maybe even venture out on a different kind of business this time.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But right now, he knew he was not in the right headspace. His mind was preoccupied by thoughts of Jesse and Yugo’s wedding. Despite wanting to delay it, part of him also wanted them to have the best of the best for their wedding even if the event was merely for formality and not for legality… at least not yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I knew you’d be here!” Jesse said as he entered Taiga’s office. He turned on the rest of the lights in the room. “You’ll ruin your eyes working in such a dark room.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How did you even know I’d be here? I could have had dinner plans or something.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“To be honest, this was not my first choice,” Jesse takes the seat on the other side of Taiga’s table. “I went to your apartment first but you weren’t there. So, I tried calling you but even after fifteen missed calls, you did not answer. Not even a text. Meaning, you’re working.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You make it sound like you know me so well.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I know you so well I just know you have a trick up your sleeve,” Jesse suddenly shifted to a serious one. “But I’m not scared. I believe in me and Yugo. I believe we must have the wedding sooner rather than later.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I believe this is too soon.” Taiga matched Jesse’s tone. “I am happy for you for having Yugo. Maybe I just don’t understand why you want it to be so soon.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You should get laid. Enough with burying your nose in work. You need to bury your face in someone’s neck.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto suddenly flashed in Taiga’s mind but that was not something he would tell Jesse. Hokuto was indeed attractive, there was no question about that. But Taiga was not completely convinced that there was more to it than him being attracted to his looks, he did not know Hokuto that well yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We should get food in your mouth before you say anything more.”</span>
