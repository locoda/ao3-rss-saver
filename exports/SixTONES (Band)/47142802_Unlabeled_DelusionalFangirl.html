      <p>
  <span>"Bye" he put his backpack and shut the door right behind. Is so uncommon for Taiga, he has been polite since his jr time. Even more, the group has always been his priority so they always have dinner together after rehearsals. It has been a month and nothing has changed, his performance in front of the camera is like always but something between him and the group has broken.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kouchi, was the first one to verbalize "so, who wanna talk with him?". Juri just lifted a finger, and everybody agreed. He and Taiga have been close before Bakaleya, and they seem to read each other's minds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The time for the new tour live performance has arrived. The songs, the set, lights were all well organized and the fans reacted well until the MC. What a fiasco!. Taiga didn't talk at all, all the fans could notice the lack of chemistry of the group. Shintaro presented himself as a new leader but it wasn't enough. Juri didn't know how to continue with the routine, so it was unusual for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Back in the green room, they try to talk about it without mentioning names. Setting a "gambaro" at last. Nowadays, the second show in the evening in Yokohama had the same problem with the MC and the encore. Jesse tried his best into his boke jokes, again the disconnection in the group could be seen even from the bottom of the arena.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the end of the second, Kouchi tried to call Juri, but he was so pissed off. He didn't last time in trying to pursue him, he went directly to the font.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With the crown of leader or not, Kouchi always has been the most reliable member and the most thoughtful one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Taiga, What is going on?" He reached him packing for leaving already in his street wear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tired, Can I be tired?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of us" Shin appeared out of blue half naked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You are taking me as a stupid, all of us" He raised his voice and got closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeing the thing heating up. Kouchi concealed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You have to talk about it. When you are ready we're waiting"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kouchi took Shin by the shoulders and let Taiga get out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In fact, Taiga was relieved that Kouchi has saved from a seriously angry Shin. And Kouchi has never been a great opponent to argue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Put his hoodie and headphones on to took his transport to the hotel, which was only a few blocks from there. Arriving there, he waved to his manager in the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kicked his sneakers at the genkan and found sandals "who the hell use sandals in mid winter?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Through his earphones could hear a voice and instantly recognize it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Cherry tomatoes for dinner, so you"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri would never openly tell his band members the failure of not being capable of contacting Taiga to have a private chat with him. After all these years, Taiga remained silent to all his calls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How do you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Maids are really sweet girls"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sure Mr. Playboy"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga tried to shut the curtains before turning on the lights. What will happen if someone parked in?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked towards the giant window, and was detained by the hand of Juri in his wrist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What happened?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Back off!, I'm not have to talk with you" he made a move of his hand, but Juri's fist got stronger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What happened with 'us'?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri knows very well, isn't the group the problem, that is just a side effect of their own deteriorated relationship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga made an uncharacteristic sarcastic laugh "It's never been 'us'". And this time made his hand free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know I wasn't the one I set the limits"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The truth hurts inside Taiga and makes him motionless. When he started to feel attraction towards Juri, he already had a Playboy reputation only by his last name even if he was a teen. He tried to set a bourden between him and Juri, to protect his feelings and not to fall for him. Juri always promised his life to him, he said in public he can't love a girl only if bigamy is legal, just for sending a sign for Taiga. Even though he couldn't trust his heart he made him promise they could have different partners. They share secrets, but not friends; share the bed, but not boyfriends: Taiga didn't allow Juri to tag their relationship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Go ahead, seems you are having having fun with Hoku and your harem"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know my life better than anyone!... And even naming our friend in the middle of this. Can you take your part?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga put both hands on his hips and flicked his mouth in his trademark cocky face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri at least can hear him explode. Taiga is used to keeping things inside until he cant anymore and explode as a volcano. He tried to reach his hands again, but he rejected him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't! Stop playing the good boy! I can't  anymore. Just… you don't need me anymore. Enjoy being a good boyfriend!" With the last phrase he raised his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh man! You bought that rumor" Juri said between laughs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga in a rage of anger tried to push him, and Juri grabbed his fist and pulled in a embrace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was two fucking years ago, before debut, that girl wasn't serious and I told you about her…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"While we were having sex" Taiga blurted right in Juri's face. He tried to get free but only got a few centimeters away from his body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You used a fan!. Having sex with both. You lied to her. And now, you are 'the good boyfriend'?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri doesn't know how to feel. It was the first time that Taiga expressed something romantic-like to him like jealousy. He has no solid arguments, it was pure jealousy of his secretive 'no labeled relationship'.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And you will feel better if all the fans turn against me? If they are bullying me online? Or even bullying me at concerts?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> "Punch me in the face if you want. Just don't make the members suffer from my actions"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga just facepalmed, and ended up with his resistance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kyomo, how many times I have to promise my life to you. I know the words you won't hear, but this is how I feel. I opened my heart to you countless times.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyomoto Taiga I lov…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He really didn't want to listen to it one more time, and shut Juri with a peck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn't look at him directly so decided to hug him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can't believe myself. You have always been besides me. And the guys, they suffered by my stupidity"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Kyomo, just make peace with yourself, with your feelings. Then everything will flow, all your friends are waiting for you"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri knows him too well. Not facing him is easy to ask forgiveness for all the group conflict. But, what about 'us'?. He pulled him apart and faced him, Kyomo's eyes were teary, he cupped his face and gave him a sweet and slow kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, a smile Taiga's face ducked like an innocent teenagger. Juri smiled too, he succeeded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri won't expect a direct apology from him. He is a little shy expressing his true feelings in private.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga put both  limbs behind Juri's neck and whispered right in his ear "I just didn't realize how precious Juri is to me, Sorry for all these years of stupidity"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I miss you" and welcomed the heated kiss of Taiga.</span>

          <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>FIRST FIC: be kindly reader<br/>The thing began with the concert repo of Taiga being very quiet and Juri quite unconfortable during MC on january and february this year. Also during dec 22, the rumor said the ex girlfriend of Juri during pre debut posted private photos of him like dinning.  AND... my brain got delussional over the reason behind this<br/>It would be and R rated but the A0 took my draft. So it ended diferent. Tell me what you think</p></blockquote>
