  <b>1. YUGO AND JESSE</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo does not remember how long they have known each other, he and Jesse. They naturally attracted each other, like magnets of destiny. They spontaneously walked into each other’s lives that Yugo’s memory was so hazy. He didn’t remember how, why, what started exactly. But no matter what they did, they’ve always ended up in each other’s vicinity. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was easy for them, to fall for each other.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Yugo, it was like a happy accident, for Jesse, it was definitely destiny.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were young and perky when they met. Jesse was still writing his PhD thesis at that coffee shop where Yugo started out. He was originally so clumsy that he got reprimanded by his boss every single day. Porcelain cups clattered, coffee grounds spilled on the floor, cakes weirdly cut on plates, wrong orders taken… Yugo almost got fired on his first day but Juri, who's not only his manager but also his very good friend and roommate, decided to give him another chance. He knew that Yugo needed this job to fund his studies because Yugo left the house and the town after an argument with his parents altogether. At the end of his senior year, he had shared with them his desire to become a photographer after high school, to what his parents had laughed at him, telling him he would not go far, that you can learn photography in a manual, but you cannot learn a job that will sustain you for the rest of your life. Yugo was very stubborn and stuck to his own principles: do it yourself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So he came to the city to study what he loved most at university while trying his best at his part-time job, he sucked but his attempts to do better and his smiles always warmed his customers and made him particularly popular.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s that guy who keeps pestering me when you’re off, asking for you.” Juri once said as he nudged him and pointed at that very tall guy sitting in a corner of the shop. He was often here all afternoon as he was typing all day long on his laptop for the past year. He was so focused that Yugo never knew he would pay attention to anything else than his screen. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo remembered his order. It was always a mozzarella salad, sparkling water, a donut and black coffee. He messed that order so many times but that guy always came back in spite of his numerous mistakes. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo was so grateful that he kept giving that guy free coffee, using his own staff discount code.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That guy was Jesse.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">To Yugo, Jesse was like a Greek sunset who smelled like Mediterranean salt.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><hr/><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <b>November 12th, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify">I stare at my screen, trying to read and understand the words that started to become random drawings instead of actual words. Letters are starting to jumble and melt in front of me and I knew by then that I am having hallucinations. I have been staring at this text for way too long. It is supposed to make sense, but it does not.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I feel like crying. I have to read this paper so I can quickly draft the last few pages of this chapter if I want to make it through the deadline (which is next week) and I already can feel the stress clogging my throat and immobilizing my fingers. I am in bad terms with my advisor already and I do not want to get in any more trouble.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey… J—? Jesse, right?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is you, Kochi Yugo. I remember you extremely well because I read your tag and heard the manager scream your name a lot. You are the clumsy boy that keeps giving me discounts and freebies so, as a poor PhD student who is not paid much as a Teaching Assistant, I am absolutely grateful. As much as I like teaching university students, they feel more like friends than actual students. Still, you caught my eye for a while already. We did discuss briefly, we talked about the taste of coffee beans but perhaps you do not remember. You meet a lot of customers, after all. You always sound both gentle and strong-headed and it made me smile unconsciously as I unintentionally heard fractions of your conversations from the table I always sat. You sometimes looked adorable, but I saw you as someone <em> racy </em>. Someone a bit sizzling, someone a bit sexy, someone a bit naughty… </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I am not a good talker, so when you come to me, unannounced, I start to mumble and lower my head before catching a good sight of you. You look a bit tired as of right now but you never lose this spark that makes you look so beautiful in my eyes. “Yes…”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you okay?” You ask me and I smile without wanting to.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I- I am now…” I stammer like a fool, because I <em> am </em> a fool for you, aren’t I?</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look like you want to cry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I shake my head before closing my laptop hurriedly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I need a break.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Should we eat together? I just finished my shift.” You tell me as I scan the shop whose lights were already switched off. I haven’t noticed how late it was. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I sigh and you start worrying.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If you don’t want to, it’s okay, but I got—“</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No!” I immediately cry. I always lose my control when I am being shy and that is what you do to me, you make me feel shy and stupid. “I’d love to eat with you, if you don’t mind my company.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You smile so prettily, my heart flutters and my stomach knots.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You close the shop as I gather my laptop, my books and piles of papers inside my bag in a rush. “Do you want to eat home cooked meal or in a restaurant?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I don’t dare to tell you I wanted homemade meals. <em> Yours </em>. I miss eating something that does not come from a fridge or a box.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, but I am a bit tired from school. Let’s go to a restaurant. I’ll cook for you next time.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I understand.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did I tell you I study photography? I have a presentation on lights and colors tomorrow morning. We can work side by side while eating.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You did mention it once before and that is the reason we do not meet as often as I would like. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I really want to—“ I suddenly close my mouth, very close to tell you that I would rather enjoy your food while staring at you instead of working but we barely know each other, it would be a bit creepy to say it so straightforwardly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can use my discount even when I’m not here, you know.” You tell me. “I owe you this.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is cold in the streets, I can see you trying to warm yourself up by shaking your shoulders as you retreat yourself a little bit more into the warmth of your scarf. I just let myself walk close to you so I can get a whiff of the citrus perfume you so often wear. Citrus reminds me of you. <em> Always </em>. It is bright and sour but healthy. Like you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not tell you that I was not looking for you because of that discount. I was just looking for <em> you </em>.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Kochi-kun.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Call me Yugo.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, I do and never stopped calling for you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You do not bring me to a fancy restaurant but it is not a cheap one either. You bring me to the most unexpected place, a small vintage restaurant that smells and looks like Italy. Even the waiter is welcoming us in a foreign language and I am feeling suddenly embarrassed to set a foot in a place I know nothing. But you obviously know the place, moving with assurance around the table. There are plants everywhere and we are brought to a corner table that looks incredibly romantic.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hope you like pasta,” you suddenly wonder, worry painted all over your face.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do.” I answer. “It’s a nice place.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is my favorite place, I come here often.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah I guessed.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Your crescent eyes sparkle in the dim-lit restaurant, and since it is not crowded, I feel like there is only the two of us. It might be the atmosphere or the vibe of the place but I am falling deeper for the soft smile you give me as you open the menu and talk to yourself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I keep looking at the menu although I know it by heart… I think I’ll take the same as usual.” </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you recommend?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you like?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You?</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I feel like eating some meat.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How about the carbonara?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure,” I say because I do not really care about food right now, I am not even sure I will be able to swallow anything, but I just nod along.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What will you drink?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A beer is fine.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh okay, I can’t drink, my meds won’t allow it anyway. I’ll get a lemonade.” You turn around and call for the waiter who immediately struts towards us with a big smile, he was obviously delighted to serve a regular customer. He is extra polite with you and you do the same. You quickly detail our order and the waiter does not waste one second.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can work if you need, I do not mind.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I look at the small table, not only there is not enough space but I am like that waiter, I do not want to waste a single second on my university work when you are in front of me, your hair looking fluffy and bright under the ceiling’s spotlight.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am tired of it.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is it going badly?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Depends of the day. I have to report back to my advisor every other week, she’s rather strict and I’m not very organized…” I explain. “Didn’t you say you had work too?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do, but I can’t focus without food in my stomach.” Somehow, you raise your head and stare straight at me and the hope that I am part of your distraction definitely entertains my thoughts.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The waiter comes back and I have this feeling he is flirting with you maybe because he is familiar with you but he flashes such a bright smile to you that I unconsciously pout. He is stealing the spotlight, especially when you thank him for bringing a simple lemonade.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s cheer,” I suggest as the waiter leaves again. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is my lemonade okay? For cheering.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re more than ok.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You smile bashfully, as you often do. And my heart is leaping inside my chest when your shiny eyes stare at me in ways that confuse me immensely, I feel so ashamed to feel so much over so little.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without any food in my stomach yet, and the beer decreasing, you talk about that customer that kept asking you to remake her golden chai latte, coconut milk, no sugar, with a bit of caramel syrup and you complain how stupid is the job of a barista. You want to quit every day, you tell me, but you cannot because you have to pay the bills and a new 11mm 1.2 aperture lens to buy. I understand nothing when you try to explain the specificity of your lens. You end up saying: “It’s a wide-angle lens that captures the light very well.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This is when you start telling me all about how you left home, angry with your parents, started university quite a while ago but you could not complete all the classes and had to retake them every year because you cannot focus much while working.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today too, you are not focusing on your homework.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Our dishes are placed on our table and I glare at the waiter to make him go away a bit quicker this time. Taking the hint, he excuses himself after wishing us a <em> buon apetito </em>.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As I dig into my carbonara, I almost miss the adorable expression on your face as you watch your plate of penne arrabbiata with a small leaf of basil on the top and sprinkled with small chunks of parmesan. Immediately, you take a camera out of your bag.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is my favorite dish. I might be eating this a lot, I like to take a picture of what I eat with whom.” You admit it as if you were telling me your deepest secret before snapping a picture and I do not even notice that I might be in the frame. “I didn’t take your face, don’t worry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t mind,” I say, glad that I would appear in your memories.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You laugh and suddenly point the film camera very close to my face.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll snap your eyes. They are beautifully melancholic.” You say and I let you immortalize the insides of my soul. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One day perhaps, you will be able to read it. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As you put your camera away, you join your hands to show your gratefulness for this meal. You are polite in spite of having no one around us except me.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Although I am eating, I do not watch what I eat, I would rather feed on your own joy. My chest warms up at the sight. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You even forget my existence, but I do not. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not forget the way your eyes sparkle, the little squirms you make just from eating and drinking something delicious. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so screwed,” I mutter to myself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What felt like a few minutes was actually a full hour where we stayed talking for so long that we both forgot the time. I did eat up my plate, albeit slowly, you even helped yourself into my plate. I love sharing my food with you, it makes me feel a bit closer to you. Even when the waiter comes to get our plates as you ramble about that said lens that you are willing to pay at a high price, you do not forget to ask him for your favorite dessert, without asking for the menu (you know it by heart already). I politely decline because I am not a sweets person.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t like sweets? I love it!” You gush and I simply smile at you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not really. I don’t like sugar.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, try this,” You insist as you hold a spoon to me. I stare at it before glancing at you with reluctance but your excited face and large smile convince me right away. As I slightly lean over to take the content of the spoon whole, tucking a strand of hair behind my hair to keep it away from the food, I always keep my eyes on you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Swallowing the piece of cold tiramisu down my throat, I lick the curve of the metallic spoon and the corner of my lips. You do not move at first, your expression shifting to a more troubled one but when I fall back into my seat, you slowly lower your hand and turn your head away, pretending to check your phone.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not miss the vermillon coloring your round cheeks and I smile quietly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You notice that you have missed a few calls.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I—I need to go home,” You eventually say as you hurriedly eat on your tiramisu but I do not like this.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I grab your wrist and say:</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Eat slowly. It’s okay to be late.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You do not shake under my finger, but you feel incredibly warm.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <b>***</b>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I hate how we have to part ways as we stand in front of the restaurant, I want to hold you in my arms, you shiver from the cold weather or perhaps from exhaustion. You look incredibly sleepy.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you want me to walk you home?” I ask.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not a girl, I’ll be okay.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to be a girl for me to walk you home.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Again, you are incredibly blushing and <em> again, </em>it makes me smile because I manage to get a reaction out of you, more than once. It does excite the flame in my heart.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s fine, don’t worry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” I say before opening my arms to ask for a hug. You laugh but you still accept my embrace. “Take care,” I whisper as I force myself not to bury my face in your shoulder. I might have used a lot of strength into this hug, to show how deep my affection ran.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” you say as you pull away.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">You turn around.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">I pretend to do the same but I just stay put and watch you walk away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I must have smiled like a fool at your invitation because you chuckle quietly and I immediately start to put away all of my books and laptop inside my backpack.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You are really cute!” You tell me as you wait for me near the door of the café. “You are like a puppy,” you say and I am happy with anything.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh, I forgot my other set of keys at work.” You notice but you still knock on the door of your own place. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><span>I am surprised to meet the coffee shop’s manager, Juri, at your place. I had a feeling you two were close, but did not know you were sharing an apartment. It made me feel a bit disappointed, here I thought we would spend time just the two of us together. To be fair,</span> <span>I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> a stranger, it would be strange to spend an evening just the two of us.</span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh, the handsome fella from the coffee shop! You brought him home!” Juri teases. “Nice to officially meet you. Thanks for your patronage, also.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You chuckle. “He looks so stressed, so I invited him in. Is this okay?” You ask Juri as if he is your husband and somehow, it makes me feel unwelcome. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Is this okay? </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Can my heart beat for you even if you’re taken? </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Are you two together?” I dare to ask.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You two frown at me but you do not answer clearly.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Although I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> interested, Rin would kill me if I dated him.” Juri jokes, and I pretend not to care. You smile gleefully at him though.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Stop it.” You tell Juri as you slap him on the chest and he pretends to be hurt. He’s laughing too, but in his eyes I see the hurt is running deeper, something I have seen before. “Jesse, please, just make yourself comfortable, come here and write whatever you gotta write. You must have a lot of work to do as a PhD student. Juri, be quiet for a while, okay?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri just nods before mumbling he has a gaming match anyway.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s an e-sport player, he’s actually the one paying the rent as I can’t afford it at the moment.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why is he managing the coffee shop then?” I ask as I grab my bag to put it on my lap and try to get all of my things out. Everything is folded and wrinkled but I do not mind the mess as I display it on the empty wooden table of the living room.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Fortunately, the kitchen is an open space that allows me to watch you while working.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s inherited it from his parents who retired recently. Maybe he’ll sell the business, but I think he’s kinda attached to the place.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I nod absentmindedly, feeling an abrupt surge of energy to finish reading this paper. I do not even notice you starting to cook without any loud sounds, you are precautious with me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The flow is much better than a hour earlier, it reads easier, it feels like my brain has switched on and suddenly, I am back to writing the end of this hellish chapter as words come to me like a clear fountain at the tip of my fingers.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can you take a break?” You ask so softly that I almost did not hear you, but I get distracted by your slender fingers sliding into my vision field. I see the miso soup you slowly push onto the table towards me. “I think you should eat.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I look at you and I forget all about the evil in this world for a short span.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I can.” I tell you and my fingers graze yours just so slightly as I get the bowl out of your hands.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You do not say anything but you look relieved when I close my laptop again and gracefully take your offer to stop writing for a little while.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The soup warms up my hands and my heart. I do not know what to say but I do have a question in my mind, I try to shake it off, shoo it away but it comes back to me. Hitting me in the face.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Instead I ask other meaningless things.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“How’s school?” I ask you. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Complicated! But I love it. It’s hard to juggle between my job and my studies, but I can make it work. I complain about it all the time to Juri, but I’ll get through it… I hope.” You say. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Suddenly, as if he heard his name, Juri comes out of his room, smelling the good food and startling the both of us. We do not do anything shocking, but Juri stops moving as he sees you leaning against the table, talking and smiling so softly as I sip on the soup, my eyes tightly locked into yours.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why do you stand so close to him? He’s eating, let him eat.” Juri tells you as he starts moving again towards us. You frown because you do not understand what Juri is actually implying, but then do not comment on it and you leave the table for the stove behind the kitchen counter.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You do not hear Juri sliding next to me to seat on the chair on my left.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He is such a keeper, an excellent cook.” Juri comments and I slowly turn around to face him. We look at each other and you still do not see us, you do not hear him say, “Rin is damn lucky to have a boy like him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The pang inside my chest? No one hears it, but it silently suffocates me. Juri watches me lower my head in despair. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>That is how it is. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Is it?</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You were never truly mine.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>But I was not yours either.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <b>November 14th, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I am supposed to go home, it is late, I tell you as we are both working on our laptops like mad men but you frown at me. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It is past midnight,” you remark.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, I should be catch the last train home.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can’t you stay here?” You plead me with big, round eyes that make my heart leap inside my chest. I cannot find the strength to turn you down in spite of my mind and my reason screaming how wrong that is.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t want to intrude, won’t Juri get mad?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s busy playing all night, if you don’t mind him screaming into the mic once in a while…” you laugh quietly and massage your tired eyelids. “I can set a futon inside my room.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Huh? No, the sofa is fine.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You look at the sofa and stare at me, from head to toe, I know you are judging my height.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Aren’t you too tall for that?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s fine, I used to sleep in a little sofa with my brother when I was younger.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No way, come on in.” You tell me and grab me by the arm to take me into your room. We have barely met and you bring a total stranger into your bedroom. It is kind of obscene of you, and I wish I was the only one you invited into your room this way.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I try to shake off those lewd thoughts. I should not forget you already have someone, according to Juri. I cannot, should not, make a move on you. My heart is shattered but deep down, hope faintly subsisted. That is how bad I fell for </span>
  <em>
    <span>you, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Yugo.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>As if it was blasphemy to enter the room of a taken man, I stay in front of the door even as you try to pull me inside.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t bite, come!” You insist so I just step inside.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Your room is incredibly clean and smells like citrus. I am impressed by the collection of different cameras and lenses you have placed all over your bedroom.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>As you unfold the futon for the both of us and prepare towels and clothes for me, you keep pushing me here and there to show me around until we reach the bathroom. I would like to invite you into the bath with me but I stay quiet because I know where to draw the line. Still, when I lean towards you to thank you for everything, I almost kiss the top of your head only for you to unconsciously pull away at the perfect timing, reminding me where I belong. Far from you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You smell so good after a bath and although you dried off, your hair is still wet, I feel like messing it up even more, I feel like licking the drops falling from every lock of hair. You laugh when you see me staring. You do not know why I am staring, and yet you are laughing.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>When you turn off the lights and wish me good night from your bed, I wish you good dreams from the futon.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>It is around 3 AM when you fall from your bed to join me under my covers. You are silent as you kiss the back of my neck, I shiver so bad and so loudly that you might have chuckled in the darkness.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What are you doing?” I ask you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What do you think?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What about Rin?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Jurin?” You ask back, </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No, not Juri. Rin.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Ju</span>
  <em>
    <span>rin</span>
  </em>
  <span> is his twin,” you reveal and that is how I learn that Rin, or rather, Jurin and Juri are twin siblings.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Aren’t you two together?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“…”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Juri told me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shut it.’</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>And that is how our first time goes. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>In that futon, both of us stifling in silence and darkness as you get rid of your pajamas, you are as naked as the night, but I cannot see clearly, I just feel your hands unceremoniously trying to remove my pants to ride my cock without any warning. I hate how sultry you are, how you lean towards me to kiss, and suck on my lips. You are taking me whole and it drives me insane how easy it goes in, how deep it goes inside you. I fit perfectly and you feel like </span>
  <em>
    <span>the </span>
  </em>
  <span>one.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You leave so many hickeys on the birth of my neck, and on my collarbones, it took me weeks to forget about our first night. You are moaning as you thrust yourself on my cock, it makes me want to cry at how beautiful you are. You are like a moonlight beast and I am loving your nocturnal lunacy.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I keep track at the number of rounds. Six times because we are insatiable. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I briefly think of Juri next door. Can he hear? Does he know? We make so much noise that perhaps Juri had guessed we were having sex, because you cannot keep yourself quiet, you are louder than I had expected, especially when I tie both of your hands with my shirt, you seem to like so much your whole body shiver, making you come in my hand although I barely touched you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You come easily, it makes me feel like I am the one you love.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>But it was not the case, was it?</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I heard you last night,” is the first thing Juri tells me next morning while you are gone in the bathroom and I am facing him at the table as we eat breakfast. He drinks Red Bull, I drink coffee. “He had always been a noisy one, so I know.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>My mind went blank at his every word. Suddenly, my hands try to hide the love bites you left all over my body.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I told you he was taken. Why did you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He came onto me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You can refuse him.” Juri tells me and I want to punch his disapproving face. Who is he to judge us? He is no better but back then, I did not know how bad he was. “He is </span>
  <em>
    <span>always </span>
  </em>
  <span>like this, at night. You are not special.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Juri’s confusing words hurt me more than I had expected.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What do you mean?” I try to ask Juri, and it is how I first learn about this illness of yours.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He has memory troubles. But the fact still stands. He’s Rin’s boyfriend.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

<li><b> JESSE &amp; HOKUTO</b><b></b><b></b><b></b></li>
</ol><p align="justify">Hokuto and Jesse were the best of friends. They met quite early, at the playground of kindergarten. Actually, Hokuto came to save Jesse from being bullied because Hokuto was older and Jesse was extremely shy when he was being mocked for being different. Ever since that day, they did everything together, even promising that they’d never let each other go. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They grew up together, they learnt together and they had no secret for each other. They spent so much time together that their families merged. Hokuto was raised by his mother since her husband died very early in a helicopter crash, leaving her with a wealth to spend and a son to raise. Jesse was raised by his father whose wife ran away overseas for a richer man. Gradually, Jesse’s father and Hokuto’s mother got together and told their sons they would become one big family. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse was overjoyed: not only he’d get the mother he never had but Hokuto was now officially bound to him. He was fourteen, Hokuto sixteen. That was the ungrateful age where Hokuto had simply started to drift away from the family, away from Jesse as well. He even asked to change high schools. He never accepted this brand new brotherly relationship, this family was not the one he had wanted. When he turned eighteen, he just left without saying a word. Hokuto’s mother was inconsolable, losing her son over her new-found love, she could never understand. She hated her son for being so selfish, loved her son because he was her son but she just wished he could accept her life. Jesse knew why he was being like this, it was his fault Hokuto drifted away. Hokuto would enter into mutism and anger every time Jesse would mention the fact they were now brothers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not your brother.” Hokuto would say and it pained Jesse, and their parents when Hokuto was reacting like this. Hokuto couldn’t control the way he was feeling, so he thought it was best he left.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <b>December 23rd, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">More than a month (exactly, forty-one days) and I am still not over the fact that you and I finally talked and slept together in one night. I was too embarrassed to set a foot in the coffee shop because I am a romantic guy: I never sleep just after meeting someone. But you are <em> so </em> special that you invade my thoughts every single day in spite of me trying to forget about you. You who are taken by someone else, you who are protected by your guard. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I am just a dog. Loyal. Patient.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">My problem is that I cannot refuse you, not even when I meet Jurin for the first time. We bump into each other as we both head to the train station. Our universities are different but from the same campus, so not too far from each other. I have never bumped into you before, never even crossed your path until I opened the door of the Tanakas’ café.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, hum, Jurin, this is— what was it? Jesse?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I am not sure if you are doing it on purpose to hurt me, to ease Jurin or if your illness is kicking in. No matter what it is, I feel like my heart being crushed again and again and again and always.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes,” I manage to say, although I just want to run away. I do not want to see the two of you together. I start to feel that my vision is getting blurry and my ears ringing. I just cannot believe you would forget my name that easily. Because when you were fucking me, you definitely did not forget which name to scream. “I am Jesse,” I announce, faking a large smile. I am good at pretending, but unfortunately, you see through me and I see the surprise in your eyes when I hold out my hand towards Jurin. “I met your brother too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, nice to meet you! I’m Jurin. I’m glad you already met Juri, our golden boy. He’s actually the little brother though. I was born thirty-six minutes before him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her brightness matches Juri, they are not twins for nothing ; the both of them exude an energy that draws you in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Loving your coffee shop, I spend a lot of time there.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You didn’t come the past weeks though,” You remark, and you are right. I was avoiding you to stop my feelings from swallowing me whole. I am surprised that you noticed that I did not come.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is this how you two met?” Jurin asks, and I just nod. “Yugo doesn’t have many friends. I am glad you are one of them.” She says as she smiles with genuine sincerity that makes me feel even worse for sleeping with you, <em> her </em> boyfriend. I am sorry, Jurin, I am sorry for falling for your man. I could not control this feeling that had been invading me ever since I met you.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He’s a great guy, he gives me freebies at the café,” I throw a joke to make it pleasant for the two of you to be with me, I would hate it if you and her ended up disliking me. You might not dislike me, but I hate myself for feeling so damn jealous at the way you look at her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh that is why you two are friends? It’s true that Yugo has a kind soul.” She adds.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And before my heart could be torn apart any longer, I pretend to look at my watch but my vision is too blurry to catch the minute hand on it: “I really have to go, I have an appointment with a teacher, I can’t make her wait any longer.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I wave a weak hand before leaving you two to your fluffy matters which do not concern me. I need to get farther from you so, instead of going to the train station, I walk back to my faculty’s building, as if I really had an appointment with a teacher. In reality, I just want to crumble in a corner.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I keep walking until I am far enough to break down in the middle of the street. I know I look ridiculous when I am dramatically crouching on the sidewalk. A lot of people pass by, not caring about a tall guy curling and crying like a child.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesse?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I cannot believe what I am hearing. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Is not yours.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is Hokuto’s.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I stand up immediately.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh my god, Hokuto? Is that you? What are you doing here?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I was looking for you, somehow. We need to talk.” He tells me straightforwardly. He looks so determined, in a way I had never seen in him before. I scowl at him worryingly, but I am too thrilled to see him and pull him into a big embrace. I could feel my best friend and brother in my arms for the first time in seven years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I missed you so much, Hokuto.” I do not let go, because I know that the next second I let him go, he will be gone for many days, months and years.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, Jesse. Let’s get out of here. I can’t bear it to see you so miserable here,” Hokuto tells me and I stare at him, dazed and confused.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He grabs my hand to walk away like he used to do when we were kids, but he is smaller than me and his hands are bigger and stronger than before. Before we leave the street, I turn around and I glimpse your face amongst the crowd. I do not see Jurin though, I just see you looking incredibly sad and I want to break free from Hokuto’s hold to comfort you but he does not let me go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re hurting me, Hokuto,” I tell him as we reach another faculty’s building. I have never gone there but Hokuto seems to know his way well. He makes us sit down on an empty bench. Around us, a few tired students lazily walk past.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sorry…” He apologizes before finally loosening his grab on my hand, but still never letting me go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why are you here? Why now? Your mom is worried about you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You know why.” Hokuto says and he looks at me in the eye. He is dark and handsome, but infinitely pained by something I do not understand.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I get that you don’t want to be my brother, but nothing really changes between us.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It does, you know I love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you too, Hokuto.” I tell him, frowning. He sounds serious.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you doing it on purpose, Jesse?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, I <em> do </em> love you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hold me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But, would you kiss me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I guess, sure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“In bed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m getting confused.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Have sex with me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What?” I suddenly stop, and realize what he meant all of those years. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I have never thought he would think more of our relationship. I thought our bond was old and strong enough that it was naturally platonic, that it went beyond sexual desires. I did see him like a brother and someone dear to me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Suddenly, I am having flashbacks of him averting his gaze, or avoiding to look straight at me in the eye. The way he would just notice things I have never thought anyone noticed. He had observed wisely, but instead of being an attentive big brother, he was simply in love with me and it made me sadder. He actually is the reason of our mother’s affliction… or rather, I am. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You are so dense, it annoys me.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am so—“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t say it, I don’t want to hear it.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“…Why did you decide to tell it to me <em> now </em> and not before? It’s been almost a decade, how can you be so sure you still have those feelings for me?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s too hard… To be far from you. I want to be near you when you need me. I want to be sincere and truthful until you return my feelings. I won’t give up. I thought I should be out of your life and bury my feelings inside me, but it is too hard when I see you looking so miserable.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Do I look miserable? Is this what loving you makes me look like to other people?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How did you know I was here because I’m <em> pretty </em> sure you didn’t ask mom and dad,” I ask him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I didn’t know,” He tells me but I do not know if he is saying the truth of not. “I’ve seen you walk into your building every day for years. I just hid when you were around. I sometimes meet Shintaro. He sometimes talks about you, and the boy you’re currently into.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I freeze at the mere mention of you. I can feel Hokuto wants to talk to me about you but I refuse to hear anything and immediately, I stand up from the bench, ready to leave, ready to flee.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Shut up, Hokuto.” I tell him, and it is the first time I talked so roughly to him. If he is taken aback by my sudden outburst, he does not show it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, Jess, you have to understand. This Kochi Yugo. He’s a player, he’s no good for you. I know him.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Anger starts boiling in my veins, I know I can get angry very violently, you often tell me how red and scary I get when I am furious. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, Hokuto. <em> You </em> should be the one trying to understand what your mother felt when you disappeared on us. You don’t even come back for New Year, you don’t call or send a text message for this and now you dare show up in one of my lowest moments? Hokuto, I’m s— I’m sorry, I can’t do this. I wish I could thank you for your love, but you’re making me incredibly sadder.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“…You don’t have to step on my feelings like that,” Hokuto sulks subtly, I barely see it on his face, but the way he very slightly pouts his lower lip, I know he is sulking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Because you don’t?” I answer back, because I am obviously hurt by how he comes back and dumps a lot of information that I still do not digest to this day. “I’m sorry Hokuto, I can’t do this. Either you come back home, or you don’t come back to us at all.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Could you at least listen to what I have to say about Kochi?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, Hokuto.” I repeat. “Sorry, I really can’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is not denial because I did not need Hokuto to tell me what you are. You are different and I knew that from the beginning. I would rather witness it with my own eyes and make my own mistakes than to be warned by Hokuto’s ulterior motives.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I stand up and leave him there, on that bench.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <b>December 24th, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">My father likes to celebrate Christmas and New Year in family, so I always go back home during those days. As usual, our Christmas is just the three of us. Mother, though, always sets four plates, she says it is for any unexpected guest that would have nowhere to spend Christmas but I am aware that she waits for Hokuto to show up unannounced. It had been painful over the first years, now it is a habit that does not faze me anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today, though, for the first time, it annoys me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Mom, you should stop setting for the fourth guest.” I tell her and she frowns at me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why not?” She asks without getting mad, she would have usually, but she might have discerned the strangeness in my voice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He is never coming back. He is too selfish for that.” I say, and it is the first time I have such hostile thoughts about Hokuto. I have never had a bad word to say about him in a decade, but today my anger caught up to me. “He won’t come back.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She stares at me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jess…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door of the family house suddenly rings. And my father, mother and I exchange worried gazes. My father is the brave one who goes to the door to answer first but my mother and I follow him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The shock is so huge that none of us make any noise.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is, of course, Hokuto.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He is in tears when he mutters a shy and embarrassed hello before both of our parents welcome him into their arms. They all cry together on this Christmas miracle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But I cannot help but feel even angrier at Hokuto.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I pretend happiness for the sake of our family though.</p><p align="justify">
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I hear a knock on the door and I consider running away through the window. I do not want to make a fuss here, especially not in front of our parents who are sleeping soundly and happily. Their son came back, he came home but they do not know the ugly truth behind, and having to hide something like that does not sit well with me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesse,” he whispers with that very low, sultry voice of his. I used to notice the raspiness of his voice before but until now, I have never noticed how silky it actually sounded. “Open up. I know you’re not sleeping.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Just because you’re older, you can’t order me around.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, Jesse.” Hokuto pleads in a way that used to soften me. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesse. I promise not to talk bad about Kochi Yugo. Can you open up, please? Let’s talk a little. Let me make amends.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I open the door, because it is what I want to hear the most. I do not want him to come back to destroy everything that I have built in his absence, like my love that blossomed for you. He has no choice, no weight in whom I get to love.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It might have been only two months since we truly talked but it had been much more since we have actually met. It was a slow interest at the beginning before becoming a crushing heart crush. Never knew it would explode into something deeper and I barely know you.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Hokuto enters my bedroom, in which he has not stepped inside in years, he looks around, sweeping through the room with an attentive eye. He has always been very observant, he did not change on that aspect, at least.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I sit on my bed and he sits at my desk. I see him feel the surface of the old oak under his palm, as if he was reminding old times where we would sit together at that desk to study together. Hokuto did help me a lot with school, he had always been a better student and a great big brother.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Talk,” I order him with a harsh voice that makes him wince. I feel bad, but I am still angry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am sorry for running away.” He starts like he should have started when we first met, yesterday. “I am sorry for hiding my true feelings and for disappearing. I am sorry for springing on you like this, it was not the right way to greet you after so much time. I am sorry, Jesse.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The tension that invaded my muscles suddenly dissipates and I relax more. The anger is not gone, just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry but I don’t regret the love that I have for you, we weren’t meant to be brothers. You know that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If not brothers, then perhaps friends. But we can’t be lovers, Hokuto.” I tell him because I have to make it clear to him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He sighs, because it is not what he wants to hear. And I know it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We’re not blood related,” Hokuto insists.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Does it matter?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Keep an open mind for me, if you can love him, then you can love me the way I want.” Hokuto says and he troubles me. The way he is so stubborn, he has always been like this, but this is the first time I see him intensely determined. Does he love me that much? To the point he would destroy everything else in his life?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No,” I do not want to give an open mind, no. I do not want him to keep destroying everything just for me. This is a downfall to insanity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“But I came back. For you.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I asked it for your mother. I didn’t promise you anything, Hokuto!” I start to raise my tone, but not too much or our parents would hear us. The walls are so thin in this house that I did hear Hokuto masturbate in his bedroom but I never said a thing. Now that I think about it, perhaps he was touching himself while thinking of me. The mere thought seethes me with rage and I stare at Hokuto with so much fury in me that I know he can feel it. “I c-can’t.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without waiting for Hokuto to say anything, I get up from my bed, grab a jacket before storming out of my bedroom, out of the familial house which did not feel like home anymore. I cannot believe Hokuto is tainting every little detail, every innocent memory I had of him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is extremely cold outside and I keep walking in the darkness of the night, beneath the Christmas lights that illuminate my way. I do not know how long I walk, but while walking I keep thinking of my thesis. Although I sent a draft to my advisor a bit later than expected, she did not answer my mail. It is Christmas but I had expected a quick read-through so I could edit a bit before my update meeting in January.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As my mind ran and circled around my upcoming research session, I eventually recognize the street and raise my head to the sign of the Café Tanaka. I walked so much I ended up to that place… And I am surprised that the lights are still on and the shop was bustling with people. They were usually busy working people but this time, it is fancy crowd that is filling up the space.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And, then I spot you there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Of course you are there.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe I unconsciously walked to you.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But what I am seeing is breaking my heart. Behind the window glass of the coffee shop, I see you on the arm of Jurin. You two look gorgeous in your matching emerald velvet outfit. So green, so smooth. You two are laughing so brightly — Such a perfect match, I might say, but it makes me want to cry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How did I fall so deep for you? There is no real reason behind this.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You smile so warmly as your arm tighten around her thin shoulders, and I can see how you are leaning your head softly towards her. You decide to let her go only to grab your camera that has been hanging on your neck and take a picture of her in the crowd. I am pretty sure it looks fantastic. But this heartbreaking sight is being robbed from me when Juri slams the door of his own shop, walking down the stairs hastily — urgent steps that make him look like he is on the run — while lighting up a cigarette.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he finally looks up and our eyes meet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He cackles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re the last person I want to see,” Juri spits out, looking away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not answer, I am not one to entertain or feed someone’s anger.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I met her the other time, your sister. Briefly.” I just tell him as I keep looking through the glass wall.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“With Y— I mean, Kochi-kun.” I purposely do not use your first name because I think I want to add distance from us but Juri sees right through me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why are you here? You’ve not been invited, if I recall correctly.” Juri asks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I needed some fresh air and ended up here.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, me too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I never told you about this Christmas where Juri hands a cigarette to me and a flask of whiskey he has hidden in the inside pocket of his suit jacket. He looks dashing in his Bordeaux suit, long bangs framing the side of his face… maybe that is why I got troubled. I wanted to forget about Hokuto’s insane obsession, about the one true love between you and Jurin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sleeping with you was the thing that made me fall even deeper for you, the thing that ignited a true hope inside my heart and now, I cannot let it go, cannot tame or extinguish it even if I had wanted to.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Juri and I sat on the last step of the bottom of the stairs, and together, we drunk and talked for the first time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is good stuff you got here,” I tell him, while tasting the alcoholic beverage burning my palate and throat. The kind of pain that can soothe anyone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“My family has quite the collection from all around the world. They are always traveling ever since they left me and Rin in charge of the coffee shop. I said I would but it is very hard for me to juggle between two jobs.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t you want to quit one of them?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I plan to leave the coffee shop to Yu-chan one day.” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is the first time I hear Juri call you that way, I am surprised by the name but I unconsciously smile at the innocent tone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Does he know about it?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No, of course not. He’s determined to become a photographer you know.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not know anything, but I do not tell him that. Instead, I want to hear more about you and only Juri would be able to provide a more objective view on the kind of person you are. And the way he talks about you, I know he is fond of you.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“His parents are against his dreams and he came here with only a strong will. He came to <em> me. </em>I feel responsible for him and although he wasn’t very good at first, he picked it up quickly and is now better than me at handling the account book.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Your sister doesn’t want to take over?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The mere mention of Jurin makes Juri’s fond smile fade slightly. “Oh no, she has her own business to take care of.” He says, suddenly saving words about his sister. “And Yu-chan.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you really interested in Yugo?” I ask Juri, finally dropping the honorifics.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When I turn towards him, I see how his cheeks were tinted in pink from the cold and the alcohol. He is without a coat, but he does not shiver or if he is cold, he does not show that he is. It is still Christmas’ Eve so I slowly take off my coat and pull it over my shoulders and invite him next to me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We slept together.” Juri tells me as he gets closer to me, under my coat and I am now the one freezing. “A lot. Even before <em> they </em> were officially dating, they are high school sweethearts.” I regret sharing my one and only protection against the cold with someone who also slept with you. Without thinking, I am sliding the coat away from him as I avert my eyes from Juri’s fingers as he puffs on his cigarette. Alcohol and perhaps, pain, makes him stare into the air so he does not notice how the coat is not covering his shoulders anymore. He is not feeling the cold anymore, perhaps, numb from the pain and the alcohol.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He is still sitting against me, his body warming me up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can’t tell her. I don’t have the guts to tell her the truth about me and Yugo. I can’t tell her about this weird illness. He is such in denial, I don’t know what to do. I am just living selfishly, as closely as possible. But it tears me apart.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“She didn’t notice?” I ask.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not yet… He is forgetting things at night, mainly and since he is living with me right now… she lives a bit far from the university and the coffee shop, that’s why he’s here but perhaps, it was a bad idea.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Juri avoids using his sister name and dropped the childhood nickname he usually gives you. I can feel how much he loves you, especially when I discern tears welling up at the corners of his eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You should stop now before you end up in crumbs and dust.” Juri warns me. “You never know what he’ll forget. He might forget sleeping with you, he might forget he’s dating Jurin, sometimes, he forgets <em> you </em>. It hurts, Jesse. You—“</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door of the coffee shop opens and Juri and I slowly rise our heads towards the entrance, where you show up, unannounced, but beautifully unaware.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesse?” You ask and I am glad you did not forget about my name (yet). “Juri?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Juri’s traits are exhausted but he still looks at you when you call for him. He is unfocused, but he does his best.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s freezing outside, come on in!” You cry as you run towards us to grab us by the arms, making us drop tobacco and spill alcohol on the ground. “It’s Christmas’ Eve but you two look so sad. Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I think Juri is not feeling well, I’ll walk him home,” I tell you as I pick up the now empty flask and the still lit cigarette. Juri does not even protest as the both of us pull on his arms to lift him up.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You release us without an uproar. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” you softly say.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Juri stares at the ground as he turns around to take off by himself down the street.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Before following him, our gazes unfortunately meet and you quietly reveal with your flowery mouth: </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve missed you.” </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It felt like a caress to my ear, and a torture to my heart.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Either way, I was left in shambles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <b>December 25th, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Can you forgive me? </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The screen of my phone keeps lighting up the room as it silently rings. I know Hokuto is calling me but I wish to stay in the darkness as Juri hastily removes his shirt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">My vision is a bit blurry and the world is spinning at little bit when Juri is pushing me onto the bed as he aggressively pull my pants off. I should have known he was a violent one. I just hoped it was you who were going down on me with a determined hand and a wet mouth around my cock. I close my eyes shut as Juri is sucking me off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He is silent enough for me to imagine you instead, and come as I hear keys jingling. You are already home? I thought. I might have dreamt it but when Juri suddenly plays with the tip of my cock, a tongue sliding in the foreskin of my cock, I let out a loud groan.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ssh,” he says and I am reminded that you are not there. It is still Juri who takes my hands and guide them inside him and I forget everything at the moment I feel his flesh wet, cold and slick from lube welcoming me.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">We were just lost and cold, looking for a little bit of warmth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Can you forgive me?</p><p align="justify">
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A massive headache wakes me up late. It is Christmas morning but it feels like the morning after a New Year’s Eve. I am definitely having a big hangover and when I look around me and notice where I am, I cannot help cursing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I recognize Juri’s room from the rainbow lit computer behind the gaming chair and the darkness of the place. I turn around to see him still sleeping. Even if he should look like he is at peace, his eyebrows are incredibly furrowed and I feel bad for him. Especially when my eyes lay on the smiling picture of you and him standing on his night table. I am surprised that Jurin is not even in the picture. I also feel bad for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without waiting for anyone or anything, I look around the bed for my things, dressing up in a hurry to quietly sneak out of Juri’s place.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As I open the bedroom door, I can see your back and a bowl of steaming ramen in front of you. You do not turn around but I know you heard me close the door behind myself. As much as I wanted to be quiet, I know that you can feel my presence even if you do not turn around. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Should I greet you? Or just leave quietly? You are undecipherable. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You are still staring at your bowl like you could see the future in it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Huh… good morning, Yugo.” Is the only thing that comes to my mind as I walk past you, not daring to look at you. I already feel ashamed, even if I should not.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You do not answer and I cannot read the atmosphere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Are you remembering our night together?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Did you just come home from a passionate night with your legitimate lover?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Aren’t you quite the flirt?” You suddenly ask without any greeting, but it caught my attention and when I turn my head towards you, you are staring at me. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not know what to say.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What am I supposed to answer to this?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was a drunken, desperate night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You were the one I was thinking about in Juri’s bed and nothing could make me forget you. But you… you are forgetting me. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If you are forgetting me… then perhaps you will forget this as well?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I retrace my steps and as I am gripping the back of your chair and the edge of the table, I bend over to leave a lingering kiss on your lips. But that, too, was a mistake, because now, all I want to do is kiss you again and as soon as I retreat a few centimeters from your face, I feel drawn to you again and this time, your lips are moving with mine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ve missed you too…” I whisper, not knowing if you remembered what you have told me the day before.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Strength is leaving me as you grab my shirt to make me kneel in front of you. This time, you lock me between your arms and you pull on my lip between your teeth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Christmas gift?” You ask as your foot is already grazing my inner thigh and playing with my fully clothed groin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I smile at the naughty suggestion, you <em> are </em> as racy as I imagined you to be. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Juri said you’re a noisy one…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What does he have to do with <em> us? </em>”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t want him to hear.”  How cruel would it be? To make him hear you screaming getting fucked by the same man that had just fucked him? </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">We were fucking out of love for you, you know.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Why? Are you two dating now? Is this why you didn’t come to the coffee shop? What about H— that black haired boy, the other time?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I look at you, completely confused. For someone with bad memory, you remember incredibly weird details.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“…I’m just gonna get going, um… Merry Christmas, Yugo.” I tell you, because I would rather run away than having to tell you the real and ugly truth.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah.” You answer sarcastically and wave me off. “Sure.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>

  <b>December 31st, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Shintaro throws a party for New Year’s Eve. That is what he does best. This year though, he has to handle it on his own since I am too busy trying to meet another close deadline. My advisor loves to make sure I do not have a social life, she hates me that much.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>So this year, he asks for the special contribution of Hokuto. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I did scream at him on the phone for not telling me that he knew where Hokuto was. But Shintaro said he could not refuse him when Hokuto had begged him not to tell me anything (although, I remember Shintaro assuring me that Hokuto was fine when I confided my worries about him), it was obviously hard for Shintaro not to tell me because we are best friends and we do not hide much from each other. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>When I had questioned Shintaro about you, Shintaro raised an eyebrow before telling me that… he did not remember mentioning you once. The only thing he might have said was about “Jesse’s hard crush.” Because yeah, I crushed hard on you for months and that was a nickname Shintaro gave you. It is a silent pining that I preciously carry with me, but now that I have tasted you, I wonder if I can survive without another taste.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I am the one who refused you on Christmas, after all. But Juri did not deserve any more pain that day.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“If Hokuto’s here, I’m not coming, Shin.” I tell him and Shintaro sighs in frustration, scolding me with his eyes behind his glasses. He is busy preparing the place, I am surprised he did not rent the Tanaka Café for the party but he got a whole warehouse instead, it was owned by his family so it was free. It could have looked shabby, but they put on so many panels, spotlights and balloons that the place looked genuinely classy enough for a New Year’s Eve party.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can’t you two make up?” Shintaro complains as he climbs up the ladder with scotch tape and balloons in in his hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Do you even realize how bad it is?” I ask Shintaro. I did tell him all about Hokuto, and he was far from being surprised. Perhaps Hokuto already told him everything, but generally, Shintaro is rarely surprised by anything, he just smiles and nods along. Nothing in life surprises him, he is always in search of things to marvel and unravel him though. I know Shintaro though, this is just a wall he puts up to protect himself.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, he wants to fuck his little brother, what’s up.” Shintaro snickers.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“This is disgusting, I hate you so bad.” I yell at him as I look around to see if any of Shintaro’s helpers heard us. But they were probably too busy to get the decoration done in time for tonight.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Chill out. I am joking, you two aren’t brothers, it’s fine, you think too much, Jess. I mean I knew since forever… Since we were kids, he was already crushing on you hard. Your parents marrying didn’t help his feelings. He was very conflicted. You know he doesn’t have many friends. I think, he was too dependent on you so he left.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“But him coming back like a snowball thrown at my face, it hurt so bad.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I’ll tell him to calm down.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I raise an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s no more depending on me, but on you now, right? You like that.” It is not a question, I eye Shintaro who does not say anything, keeps on trying to tape the end of the balloons on the panel. I watch him struggle. “Whatever.” I say as I abandon him to head towards the exit before I could meet Hokuto.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Jess.” He calls from the top of the ladder.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What?” I yell.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>He does not look at me when he says:</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yugo, and the J twins are coming too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>No matter how hard I try to focus on the research book I have in my hands, I cannot focus.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I have to see you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>A glimpse is okay, even if you are with Juri and Jurin. Even if Hokuto might witness my love for you and judge me for it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I shut my laptop and find my way towards my closet to find an outfit that would fit the dress code for Shintaro’s theme: royal blue and silver. Fortunately, I do have a silky silver shirt and some dark blue costume pants that I rarely wore.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Sighing deeply, I try to reconsider my decision. Is it worth it? I do not know, but I want to see you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Of course, when I make my arrival, everyone is already there. Shintaro literally runs towards me with a happy smile, he is beyond overjoyed to see me here. He has been expecting me, he says, and sits me at my table where I am of course sitting between Hokuto and Yugo, and I am cursing him. Shintaro is sitting next to Hokuto and a boy that I do not know. Next to you and Juri, your gorgeous girlfriend Jurin who sports the most beautiful silver and diamond dress that makes her stand out of the crowd. Especially in a table full of boys.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I greet everyone with an energy I did not know I had.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Hey, I didn’t meet you before?” I ask as I give my hand to the one I have never met before to shake.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>He stands up to shake my hand vigorously. I am a bit surprised.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“No? I used to be in Hokuto, Juri, Jurin and Yugo’s judo club, I am Taiga.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Confused, I look at you and Hokuto. You two are not even looking at each other, avoiding to meet your gazes as much as you can.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You know my brother?” I ask you, pointing at Hokuto. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re siblings?” You ask me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Our parents remarried,” Hokuto corrects, his tone curt. He was obviously annoyed at me for using the word “brother” again. “I grew up with Jesse and Shintaro.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The same way we grew up with Taiga and Yugo,” Jurin intervenes. “Taiga is doing an internship in a local hospital in our hometown, though. He doesn’t come to the city often.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, just say I’m peasant, Rin?!” Taiga immediately bickers with her and she bursts out of laughter with her brother. You follow along, laughing with your eyes, but as I am sitting at my chair, I feel your foot under the table, as you get rid of your shoe to leave it somewhere near my feet.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I flinch at the sensation of your leg grazing mine, and the hot palm of your foot rubbing against my crotch.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>What do you want? I want to ask you. But as I try to look for your eyes, you are watching something else, your eyes are somewhere else but your body is definitely reacting to my presence. You know what you are doing and your illness has nothing to do with this.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Today though, I do not feel like giving in your little games, not in presence of our friends.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I pull away from your foot and I see you slowly turning your head towards me. I caught your attention. It makes me smile, makes me want to play with you even more. If this was all it took to catch your attention.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I do not look back at you, and even sit closer to Hokuto although I do not talk to him either, still mad at him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can you stop being mad for tonight?” Hokuto actually asks so imperceptibly.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Only if you stop trying to dissuade me from falling in love.” I answer in a small voice, making sure that no one would catch on our conversation.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I think it’s too late, right?” He whispers in my ear.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So, you really know him.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, do you remember I had to transfer Judo club because mine closed? That’s where I met Taiga, the J twins and Yugo. When I asked to transfer high school too later, it was to be closer to them. The club was really far from home by walk so your dad always drove me to that other city so I could attend it. I thought, how nice it was to have a dad.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s also yours, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, perhaps. In another lifetime where I don’t fall in love with my best friend turned brother.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto’s frank answer is quite new to me, he has never been someone who would voice out so easily his feelings but perhaps he had exploded after years and years of burying it deep. He avoids my gaze and I cannot help blushing hard at his confession.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>What can I say to that? </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I do not have the strength to fight with him right now so I just let Shintaro pour champagne into my glass as I gulp it down straight without even toasting with the others.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You could have waited for us!!” Everyone is screaming at me and I laugh while Shintaro had to pour a second time.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>After clinking our glasses together in a cheerful and loud noise, everyone happily took a sip as my eyes could not help but wander towards you and finally, our gazes met. You do not drink a drop, I notice, you pretend that you did. You place carefully the glass back on the table, between our two plates and as you reach for the bottle of water on the middle of the table, your elbow </span>
  <em>
    <span>accidentally</span>
  </em>
  <span> knock over your glass, breaking it on the corner of the table, spilling the sparkly alcohol on my lap.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Silently, I watch the scene unfold in front of me and strangely, I do not even move from my seat, I would have jumped and stood up from the surprise but this time, I just remained still. You look at me and you hide the most secretive smile as you cry out:</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Oh my god! Jesse, I am so sorry! Are you okay? You should clean this up right now before it stains.” You say in a worried tone. “Let me help you out.” I am surprised none of your close friends do not notice how fake you sound. Well, Hokuto and Juri definitely knew: Hokuto rolled his eyes and Juri looked at us with annoyance. You grab me by the arm and take me away from them with a firm hand.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>As we walk away, I cannot help but enquire:</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“A long time ago, Hokuto told me he fell in love with someone he shouldn’t be loving that much. It is only today I realized it’s you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And?” </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I was curious. I knew that the black-haired boy you hugged the other day at uni was Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Really?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We had sex, right? That night. It’s blurry in my head, but I know it is you. No one felt like </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>. That’s why you’re avoiding me? Did you hate it?” You ask in a worried tone as your hand graze the silk of my shirt.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I didn’t hate it.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Then why?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Aren’t you dating Jurin?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“That’s not the question.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It kind of is, to me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t think it is, though. You didn’t mind sleeping with Juri on Christmas.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why am I even blurry in your head? What messes your mind so much you can’t even remember who you’re sleeping with?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t know, okay? I sometimes forget some things and memories come back to me sporadically, sometimes they never come back. I even forget who I am from time to time.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So you don’t know what you want.” I state, understanding that you are so confused about yourself and your feelings that I will probably get erased over time.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Every time I see you, I really forget about the rest though. I—“</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You shouldn’t be saying this, I think. Not if you can’t choose me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Choose? But I barely know you.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Even if we just met and started talking, it hurts to hear that from you. You know how to put distance between us when I least expect it. As I fling the door open of the restroom, I open the tap to pat myself with water but you stop my fingers from reaching the running water, sneaking behind me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What? You barely know me, why are you helping me?” I ask, looking at our reflections in the mirror.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s not what I mean. I mean that I can’t choose you when you just showed up in my life. I can’t throw everything away just like that. Not when I am proposing to her. Tonight.” You whisper against my shoulder, and I barely can see your face, just your sad eyes.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“…”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>My heart simply breaks.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I stare at the water still running into the wash basin before looking at your soft fingers around my hand and I wonder why are your hands over mine when you are asking for someone else’s hand. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I am at loss because it hurt more than I had expected. “…Well, I hope you’ll forget me the way you forgot about her when we slept together.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Jesse…”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I turn slightly towards you and we look at each other when I tell you: </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I hope you’ll forget about my name, because I wish I could forget yours too.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“…Please, don’t say that, it doesn’t make me happy to forget. I just do. I often confuse Juri and Jurin, at night and it’s driving me insane. Jurin, she’s different from everyone else. She is everything I’ve ever wanted in life, she has the maturity that Juri doesn’t have, she is bright in every sense. She makes my heart flutter. I know I am making the right choice with her. She’s a real pillar in my life.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>The way you talk about her makes me want to cry, and even if the tears do not fall yet, the pouring rain in my chest is slowly becoming a storm I cannot tame.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I look down, leaning against the bathroom sink unit as you pat softly and silently the stains that you have made on my clothes.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I say: “He said you two slept together even before you started dating Jurin.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Probably.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Is this what you call making the right choices?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I don’t trust him as much as I trust her. That’s how I made my choice. He wanted the fucking and not the responsibilities. It’s all on him now.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Your words are harsh.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I understand,” I say, nodding as I sit on the unit behind me, my shoulders involuntarily slouching. “But please… Yugo…”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You open your eyes, big and worried over the begging tone that I unconsciously took.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You don’t have to choose me but… can’t you give me a little more time?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Can you not propose to her today? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not </span>
  </em>
  <span>today.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I am desperate. I want to keep you for myself. But I can’t, can I? I have to respect your choice, your space and your life. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yet my heart keeps beating so fast and so hard, I am thinking that perhaps, I can make you change your mind or make you fall for me, with or without your memories intact. Perhaps, I can make you fall in love with me again and again.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>Can I have you? Just for tonight?</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I wonder.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>And your curled eyebrows, and hesitation hurt me more than I had wanted.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Please?” I had never begged like this before, not with your hand bunching my champagne stained pants, crippling the soft fabric.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Your conflicted face is unbearable, I am thinking as I wrap myself around you, arms around your shoulders, legs around your waist, pulling you closer into my embrace, against my body. I want you to feel exactly how much I am feeling for you.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Can you feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>?</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I tighten my arms around your shoulders, adding more pressure — and ignoring the shape of a ring in the inner pocket of your jacket —, hands lost in your hair as I so softly kiss the top of your head, smelling the incredible citrus scent. For once, we are facing each other, not in the darkness but still not in the open. It is fine. I am happy to be able to see your eyes, even if you are battling with yourself, with your feelings, I can see you, feel you, smell you and most of all, I can finally touch you with my hands and my lips.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I do not dare to upset your mind so my lips softly kiss the chastest areas: the line of your right eyebrow, the corner of your eye, the top of your nose. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You pull away from my kisses and I brace myself for violence, hatred and rejection but you just stare at me, reading me like an open book. Gradually, I see the uncertainty getting washed over by the way your eyebrows unfurl, your traits smoothen and your irises sparkle.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I hear the soft shifting movement of your hands before feeling cold palms against my cheeks. Do I look so miserable? Because you look like you are sad for me. Do not be sad for me, Yugo. Because I will get you eventually, and I will make sure you remember me even if you forget.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>These are your fingers that I feel first around my tongue, prodding inside my mouth, stretching my lips in the most vulgar way. I can take it all, I can take you in. It is fine. You can torture me, if you want because I will rise stronger.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>You slide your fingers on my tongue, in and out, opening my mouth even wider for you, making a mess of myself. You smile. Do you like what you are seeing? Because I love the aroused expression you are giving me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Your fingers finally abandon my mouth only to be then violently abused by your teeth, biting my lower lip. When it is you, it does not hurt, not even when you slam my back against the mirror behind me. I do not have to turn around to know what kind of face I am making. One that tells you that you can do whatever you want with me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Are you also aggressive with Juri or Jurin? Do your hands shiver the same way when they slide beneath shirts? The slightest touch pushes me a bit closer to the edge. I start remembering our first time in the darkness where I could not see you much but feel you wither and shiver. My body trembles at the memory of you and the anticipation.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>As soon as I feel your fingers working on my zipper, reality dawned on me abruptly:</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yugo…” </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Me calling your name makes you snap out of it, as well.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We can’t here.” I tell you and you are surprised. “We have to go back to the party.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Huh… J-Jesse…?” you whisper, as if you had forgotten where we were, who you were with. But the way you scan our surroundings, we are in the bathroom of a warehouse where we are supposedly spending the New Year’s Eve. But for the first time of my life, I do not want the year to end, I do not want to let you go, I do not want us to move.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I know what it means and it tears me apart a bit more.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I really love you too much for acting that brashly. I am selfish but I still care about you.” I tell you as I caress your flushed cheek with a thumb. “You might never remember our first time, but I will never forget.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>When we come back, we look so tense that Juri and Hokuto notice it right away. They notice my expression hardening when you sit a bit closer to Jurin and she pats your knee lovingly when you come back. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Your lip is bleeding,” Hokuto comments as he hands me his own napkin. “He is still a rough one.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>It is not time to weep.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>It is time to celebrate life.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>***</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Ever since I came back from the bathroom with you, Hokuto sits close to me. I do not say anything but every time I glance at you and Jurin, you are staring at Hokuto.</span>

  <span>“Did something happen between you and Yugo?” I suddenly ask Hokuto very quietly. Hopefully all the others went to dance already and I was not yet in the mood as I pour myself another glass of champagne. I am craving for whisky, but the night is still young and midnight has not hit yet.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>He sighs.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Long story.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You want to tell me all about his bad sides but not this particular story?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Let’s move.” He orders as he drags me away by the arm (again.) I cannot help myself looking at you and Jurin and even if Jurin is smiling brightly at me, you are not smiling.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto takes my hand and for once, I just let him because I need him to open up. He brings me out of the warehouse where the music is not as loud as inside. I cannot even feel my ears and my brain anymore. Shintaro likes to blast music everywhere he goes, he probably will end up deaf.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“We were close friends,” he starts. “We had a falling out because I couldn’t stand the way he treated Juri so we almost beat each other up. I still blame Yugo for making Juri the man he is now.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The man he is now?” I repeat, incredulous.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>We crouch on the ground, leaning on the wall of the warehouse. As he is talking, Hokuto plays with the white gravel at his feet.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He breaks girls’ hearts all the time because he cannot mend his. And he never brings them home because he lives with Yugo and he doesn’t want him to move out.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I am not giving up, no matter what you say, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You’re not but I have to?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Why do you always have to bring the topic back to you?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“I want you to </span>
  <em>
    <span>understand</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The only difference between he and you is that you’re now my family even if you deny it, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Am I not bound to you forever, that way?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“There’s no forever, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“And yet, you’re willing to wait for him forever?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Until the end, yes.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“End of?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“The end.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>We are way too stubborn and I hate how similar Hokuto and I can be. I hate seeing myself in him.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He’s getting married to Jurin, anyway, so Juri will be alone.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yeah, Juri told me. He called me crying.” He says.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Yugo wanted to propose tonight but I asked him to wait.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Will he listen? I don’t think he will.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“He will.” I assure Hokuto as he helps me stand up so we can go back to the party.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>But, when we come back just in time before midnight, a few seconds before, I can see Jurin and you at the center of the warehouse, all surrounded by so many people who gave you two some space when all the spotlights are on you two beautiful creatures and understand that you are dropping on one knee.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>My heart drops in my stomach.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I do not feel the tears that suddenly blurred my vision, and I cannot even handle the sight of Jurin crying and kissing you in front of so many people as everyone else is screaming happy new year. My new year is not happy at all.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Could you not give me a little more time? Just a little?</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Did you have to propose to her now? I thought you’d wait. Did you already forget what I had asked? </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>And before I could drop to my knees for different reasons than yours, Hokuto holds my shoulders and places a gentle hand over my eyes. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“You don’t have to see this,” Hokuto voices against my ear.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>I break down in his arms, excruciating pain washing over me.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
