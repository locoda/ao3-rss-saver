  <b>1. </b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><strong>Yugo</strong> does not remember how long they have known each other, he and Jesse. They naturally attracted each other, like magnets of destiny. They spontaneously walked into each other’s lives that Yugo’s memory was so hazy. He didn’t remember how, why, what started exactly. But no matter what they did, they’ve always ended up in each other’s vicinity. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was easy for them, to fall for each other.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For Yugo, it was like a happy accident, for Jesse, it was definitely destiny.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They were young and perky when they met. Jesse was still writing his PhD thesis at that coffee shop where Yugo started out. He was originally so clumsy that he got reprimanded by his boss every single day. Porcelain cups clattered, coffee grounds spilled on the floor, cakes weirdly cut on plates, wrong orders taken… Yugo almost got fired on his first day but Juri, who's not only his manager but also his very good friend and roommate, decided to give him another chance. He knew that Yugo needed this job to fund his studies because Yugo left the house and the town after an argument with his parents altogether. At the end of his senior year, he had shared with them his desire to become a photographer after high school, to what his parents had laughed at him, telling him he would not go far, that you can learn photography in a manual, but you cannot learn a job that will sustain you for the rest of your life. Yugo was very stubborn and stuck to his own principles: do it yourself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So he came to the city to study what he loved most at university while trying his best at his part-time job, he sucked but his attempts to do better and his smiles always warmed his customers and made him particularly popular.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“There’s that guy who keeps pestering me when you’re off, asking for you.” Juri once said as he nudged him and pointed at that very tall guy sitting in a corner of the shop. He was often here all afternoon as he was typing all day long on his laptop for the past year. He was so focused that Yugo never knew he would pay attention to anything else than his screen. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo remembered his order. It was always a mozzarella salad, sparkling water, a donut and black coffee. He messed that order so many times but that guy always came back in spite of his numerous mistakes. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo was so grateful that he kept giving that guy free coffee, using his own staff discount code.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That guy was Jesse.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">To Yugo, Jesse was like a Greek sunset who smelled like Mediterranean salt.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><hr/><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <b>November 12th, 2020</b>
</p><p align="justify">I stare at my screen, trying to read and understand the words that started to become random drawings instead of actual words. Letters are starting to jumble and melt in front of me and I knew by then that I am having hallucinations. I have been staring at this text for way too long. It is supposed to make sense, but it does not.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I feel like crying. I have to read this paper so I can quickly draft the last few pages of this chapter if I want to make it through the deadline (which is next week) and I already can feel the stress clogging my throat and immobilizing my fingers. I am in bad terms with my advisor already and I do not want to get in any more trouble.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey… J—? Jesse, right?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is you, Kochi Yugo. I remember you extremely well because I read your tag and heard the manager scream your name a lot. You are the clumsy boy that keeps giving me discounts and freebies so, as a poor PhD student who is not paid much as a Teaching Assistant, I am absolutely grateful. As much as I like teaching university students, they feel more like friends than actual students. Still, you caught my eye for a while already. We did discuss briefly, we talked about the taste of coffee beans but perhaps you do not remember. You meet a lot of customers, after all. You always sound both gentle and strong-headed and it made me smile unconsciously as I unintentionally heard fractions of your conversations from the table I always sat. You sometimes looked adorable, but I saw you as someone <em> racy </em>. Someone a bit sizzling, someone a bit sexy, someone a bit naughty… </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I am not a good talker, so when you come to me, unannounced, I start to mumble and lower my head before catching a good sight of you. You look a bit tired as of right now but you never lose this spark that makes you look so beautiful in my eyes. “Yes…”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you okay?” You ask me and I smile without wanting to.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I- I am now…” I stammer like a fool, because I <em> am </em> a fool for you, aren’t I?</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You look like you want to cry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I shake my head before closing my laptop hurriedly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I need a break.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Should we eat together? I just finished my shift.” You tell me as I scan the shop whose lights were already switched off. I haven’t noticed how late it was. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I sigh and you start worrying.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“If you don’t want to, it’s okay, but I got—“</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No!” I immediately cry. I always lose my control when I am being shy and that is what you do to me, you make me feel shy and stupid. “I’d love to eat with you, if you don’t mind my company.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You smile so prettily, my heart flutters and my stomach knots.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You close the shop as I gather my laptop, my books and piles of papers inside my bag in a rush. “Do you want to eat home cooked meal or in a restaurant?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I don’t dare to tell you I wanted homemade meals. <em> Yours </em>. I miss eating something that does not come from a fridge or a box.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, but I am a bit tired from school. Let’s go to a restaurant. I’ll cook for you next time.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I understand.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Did I tell you I study photography? I have a presentation on lights and colors tomorrow morning. We can work side by side while eating.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You did mention it once before and that is the reason we do not meet as often as I would like. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I really want to—“ I suddenly close my mouth, very close to tell you that I would rather enjoy your food while staring at you instead of working but we barely know each other, it would be a bit creepy to say it so straightforwardly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can use my discount even when I’m not here, you know.” You tell me. “I owe you this.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It is cold in the streets, I can see you trying to warm yourself up by shaking your shoulders as you retreat yourself a little bit more into the warmth of your scarf. I just let myself walk close to you so I can get a whiff of the citrus perfume you so often wear. Citrus reminds me of you. <em> Always </em>. It is bright and sour but healthy. Like you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not tell you that I was not looking for you because of that discount. I was just looking for <em> you </em>.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Kochi-kun.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Call me Yugo.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, I do and never stopped calling for you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You do not bring me to a fancy restaurant but it is not a cheap one either. You bring me to the most unexpected place, a small vintage restaurant that smells and looks like Italy. Even the waiter is welcoming us in a foreign language and I am feeling suddenly embarrassed to set a foot in a place I know nothing. But you obviously know the place, moving with assurance around the table. There are plants everywhere and we are brought to a corner table that looks incredibly romantic.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hope you like pasta,” you suddenly wonder, worry painted all over your face.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do.” I answer. “It’s a nice place.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It is my favorite place, I come here often.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah I guessed.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Your crescent eyes sparkle in the dim-lit restaurant, and since it is not crowded, I feel like there is only the two of us. It might be the atmosphere or the vibe of the place but I am falling deeper for the soft smile you give me as you open the menu and talk to yourself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I keep looking at the menu although I know it by heart… I think I’ll take the same as usual.” </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you recommend?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What do you like?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You?</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I feel like eating some meat.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How about the carbonara?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sure,” I say because I do not really care about food right now, I am not even sure I will be able to swallow anything, but I just nod along.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What will you drink?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A beer is fine.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh okay, I can’t drink, my meds won’t allow it anyway. I’ll get a lemonade.” You turn around and call for the waiter who immediately struts towards us with a big smile, he was obviously delighted to serve a regular customer. He is extra polite with you and you do the same. You quickly detail our order and the waiter does not waste one second.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can work if you need, I do not mind.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I look at the small table, not only there is not enough space but I am like that waiter, I do not want to waste a single second on my university work when you are in front of me, your hair looking fluffy and bright under the ceiling’s spotlight.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I am tired of it.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is it going badly?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Depends of the day. I have to report back to my advisor every other week, she’s rather strict and I’m not very organized…” I explain. “Didn’t you say you had work too?”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do, but I can’t focus without food in my stomach.” Somehow, you raise your head and stare straight at me and the hope that I am part of your distraction definitely entertains my thoughts.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The waiter comes back and I have this feeling he is flirting with you maybe because he is familiar with you but he flashes such a bright smile to you that I unconsciously pout. He is stealing the spotlight, especially when you thank him for bringing a simple lemonade.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s cheer,” I suggest as the waiter leaves again. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is my lemonade okay? For cheering.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You’re more than ok.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You smile bashfully, as you often do. And my heart is leaping inside my chest when your shiny eyes stare at me in ways that confuse me immensely, I feel so ashamed to feel so much over so little.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without any food in my stomach yet, and the beer decreasing, you talk about that customer that kept asking you to remake her golden chai latte, coconut milk, no sugar, with a bit of caramel syrup and you complain how stupid is the job of a barista. You want to quit every day, you tell me, but you cannot because you have to pay the bills and a new 11mm 1.2 overture lens to buy. I understand nothing when you try to explain the specificity of your lens. You end up saying: “It’s a wide-angle lens that captures the light very well.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This is when you start telling me all about how you left home, angry with your parents, started university quite a while ago but you could not complete all the classes and had to retake them every year because you cannot focus much while working.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Today too, you are not focusing on your homework.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Our dishes are placed on our table and I glare at the waiter to make him go away a bit quicker this time. Taking the hint, he excuses himself after wishing us a <em> buon apetito </em>.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As I dig into my carbonara, I almost miss the adorable expression on your face as you watch your plate of penne arrabbiata with a small leaf of basil on the top and sprinkled with small chunks of parmesan. Immediately, you take a camera out of your bag.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“This is my favorite dish. I might be eating this a lot, I like to take a picture of what I eat with whom.” You admit it as if you were telling me your deepest secret before snapping a picture and I do not even notice that I might be in the frame. “I didn’t take your face, don’t worry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t mind,” I say, glad that I would appear in your memories.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You laugh and suddenly point the film camera very close to my face.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’ll snap your eyes. They are beautifully melancholic.” You say and I let you immortalize the insides of my soul. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">One day perhaps, you will be able to read it. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As you put your camera away, you join your hands to show your gratefulness for this meal. You are polite in spite of having no one around us except me.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Although I am eating, I do not watch what I eat, I would rather feed on your own joy. My chest warms up at the sight. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You even forget my existence, but I do not. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not forget the way your eyes sparkle, the little squirms you make just from eating and drinking something delicious. </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so screwed,” I mutter to myself.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">What felt like a few minutes was actually a full hour where we stayed talking for so long that we both forgot the time. I did eat up my plate, albeit slowly, you even helped yourself into my plate. I love sharing my food with you, it makes me feel a bit closer to you. Even when the waiter comes to get our plates as you ramble about that said lens that you are willing to pay at a high price, you do not forget to ask him for your favorite dessert, without asking for the menu (you know it by heart already). I politely decline because I am not a sweets person.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t like sweets? I love it!” You gush and I simply smile at you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Not really. I don’t like sugar.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please, try this,” You insist as you hold a spoon to me. I stare at it before glancing at you with reluctance but your excited face and large smile convince me right away. As I slightly lean over to take the content of the spoon whole, tucking a strand of hair behind my hair to keep it away from the food, I always keep my eyes on you.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Swallowing the piece of cold tiramisu down my throat, I lick the curve of the metallic spoon and the corner of my lips. You do not move at first, your expression shifting to a more troubled one but when I fall back into my seat, you slowly lower your hand and turn your head away, pretending to check your phone.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I do not miss the vermillon coloring your round cheeks and I smile quietly.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You notice that you have missed a few calls.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I—I need to go home,” You eventually say as you hurriedly eat on your tiramisu but I do not like this.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I grab your wrist and say:</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Eat slowly. It’s okay to be late.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">You do not shake under my finger, but you feel incredibly warm.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <b>***</b>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I hate how we have to part ways as we stand in front of the restaurant, I want to hold you in my arms, you shiver from the cold weather or perhaps from exhaustion. You look incredibly sleepy.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Do you want me to walk you home?” I ask.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not a girl, I’ll be okay.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You don’t have to be a girl for me to walk you home.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Again, you are incredibly blushing and <em> again, </em>it makes me smile because I manage to get a reaction out of you, more than once. It does excite the flame in my heart.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s fine, don’t worry.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Okay,” I say before opening my arms to ask for a hug. You laugh but you still accept my embrace. “Take care,” I whisper as I force myself not to bury my face in your shoulder. I might have used a lot of strength into this hug, to show how deep my affection ran.</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” you say as you pull away.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">You turn around.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">I pretend to do the same but I just stay put and watch you walk away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
