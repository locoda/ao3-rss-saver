<div class="userstuff">
<p>It wasn't uncommon for Taiga to take a partner home at the end of the night.</p><p>“Jesse.”</p><p>It wasn't so uncommon for Jesse either when they went to the club they often frequented. Taiga wasn't ashamed of his sex drive and he didn't judge Jesse for having a “friend” on his hip when they went to <em> wherever </em> as long as he didn't judge him when he did the same, but it was rare to see Jesse leave the club with a <em> man</em>. </p><p>“Jesse!”</p><p>He had abandoned Taiga at the club without even a text or a nod as he walked out the door and over all, Taiga didn't care with who or how Jesse found his kicks as long as he gave him the courtesy of telling him he hadn't gotten murdered or robbed the next morning. </p><p>But Taiga had never seen Jesse’s head so deep into the clouds that he didn't even have the mind to apologize for it. </p><p>Taiga finally got him to at least blink when he snapped his fingers in front of his nose.</p><p>“Hey. Hello? Earth to Jesse Lewis? Wake up.”</p><p>Jesse looked over to him, his eyes still lost in thought, but at least, in focus.</p><p>“Sorry, Taiga, what were you saying?”</p><p>Taiga sighed as he tucked his work badge into his suit. “Look, I'm so happy that your lay was so great, but I really need you to focus for this meeting or did you already forget that we're about to sell a pitch?”</p><p>Jesse rubbed his tired eyes back into reality as Taiga shoved the printouts of their presentation into his hands.</p><p>“Sorry, I just can't seem to shake it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I know. Just try to act like your mind isn't off in dreamland for the next couple hours, will you?”</p><p>Jesse gave his arms one last big stretch with a deep inhale before their elevator hit their destined floor.</p><p>“Yeah, I got it. I'm focused. I'm present. I'm here.” </p><p>Taiga checked his watch. “Yeesh. How can you be so caught up on a guy and not even get his name?”</p><p>Well.</p><p>To Jesse’s luck and Taiga’s misfortune, it wouldn't be much longer until they learned the name of his one-night partner when the elevator doors opened.</p><p>Jesse liked Yugo.</p><p>That much was obvious.</p><p>Jesse wouldn't have frozen like he just gazed into the eyes of Medusa if he didn't.</p><p>Taiga had only seen the back of Yugo’s head when Jesse pointed at him and told him over the loud music that he was going to approach the man sitting at the bar, so Yugo’s face only registered in his mind as the person who would be deciding the next several months of his career.</p><p>But once he found Jesse standing there speechless when Taiga raised his head from his deep bow, he was able to connect the lost pieces together.</p><p>Jeez.</p><p>As a good friend, Taiga did the presentation by himself as Jesse got over his shock, but that didn't mean he was <em> happy </em>about doing it himself. He had tried to scold Jesse about it on the train ride home, but it only fell on deaf ears as he watched his friend stare at Yugo’s contact on his phone in a blissful disbelief.</p><p>Taiga was glad they were at least somehow still awarded the project with only half of the pitch team fully functioning. He was confident in his own work and he was pleased to be able to return back to their office with good news, but that didn't keep Taiga from questioning the ethics of their contract when he saw Jesse approach Yugo with such bright enthusiasm the next time they met.</p><p>Perhaps things had gone a little too smoothly.</p><p>It made Taiga strongly consider whether the relationship between his friend/coworker and their new client leader should be disclosed, simply to hold themselves responsible, but the months that followed cleared his guilty conscience.</p><p>Jesse liked Yugo.</p><p>Taiga knew that well enough. Jesse made sure of that.</p><p>Taiga also knew that their relationship was just a few steps short of romantic because Jesse wouldn't stop grieving to him about how it <em> wasn't</em>.</p><p>Kochi Yugo was a man made of tension. </p><p>He was a great worker and he led his team admirably and efficiently. Taiga had never had a client that made their dealings so seamlessly painless, but as a result, his body never took a moment to relax and his shoulders looked as if they could have been made of stone. </p><p>His life was his work and his work was his life. Whether it was the debilitating societal pressure or the collapsing economy, Yugo worked himself down to the bone and it showed. Yugo’s work was great, Taiga really meant it. His documents were always so clean and concise, nearly flawless with little to clarify or correct.</p><p>But at what cost? </p><p>Well, apparently it was his morality for just one night.</p><p>Yugo preferred to drink in private but for just one night, he needed something more to take off the edge.</p><p>A bar.</p><p>A club.</p><p>Loud music with laughter, surrounded by people who were as free as the poison in the drinks they consumed.</p><p>Something.</p><p>It only took a cute smile for Yugo to realize that it was some<em>one</em>.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>He was cute. Or maybe Yugo was already drunk, but it wasn’t often he found another man cute.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“You look like you could use another drink.”</p><p>“Oh do I? Or are you just that eager to buy me another?”</p><p>“Maybe a bit of both.”</p><p>His laugh was cute too.</p><p>“So what do you drink? I'll buy it for you.”</p><p>The man’s arm was hot to the touch when it grazed his own.</p><p>Yugo couldn't remember the last time he felt the heat of another human in such a way, but it didn't matter. </p><p>He just knew it had been far too long. </p><p>“If you're buying, then my favorite flavor is the most expensive thing on the shelf.”</p><p>“Cut me some slack here,” the man chuckled. “How about we agree on something in the middle?”</p><p>“Fine, I guess I'll settle for that since you're cute.”</p><p>Yugo didn't expect the pink in the man’s cheeks to get any brighter. </p><p>“You think I'm cute?”</p><p>“Hmm, just a little,” Yugo lied as he was ordered a whiskey on the rocks.</p><p>“Well what a coincidence. I think you're pretty cute too.”</p><p>The alcohol was smooth on his tongue, leaving a fire in its trail as it went down.</p><p>“Are you flirting with me?”</p><p>“That was the intention… Is it working?”</p><p>Yugo licked the rim of the glass cup, catching the drop of whiskey that was left on the ridge. </p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>The man moved closer, his arm settling on the back of his bar stool to leave no personal space between them. His breath was like fire against his ear as he whispered into its shell.</p><p>“How does your drink taste?”</p><p>Yugo grabbed the front of his shirt, the man flinching, but not daring to draw away. </p><p>He smiled as he knocked back his glass, draining the rest into his mouth and leaving only the polished crystal clear ice in the cup.</p><p>He made sure to swirl his drink around his tongue before he swallowed and blew its flavor against the man's lips to give him a tease of its flavor.</p><p>“If you want to know how it tastes, why don't you come closer and find out?”</p><p>That night, Yugo took out all his stress on the tall handsome man, letting him stretch and pull him in whatever way gave him pleasure. </p><p>It was an excellent and efficient way to relax his muscles and relieve his tension.</p><p>Maybe <em>too</em> excellent and efficient for Jesse, unfortunately.</p><p>Jesse wanted a romantic relationship. </p><p>Yugo didn't. Or he at least wasn't thinking about it. </p><p>His mind was on his work, not whether his stress outlet wanted to actually go on a date rather than straight to a hotel.</p><p>It agonized Jesse by the day.</p><p>Which meant Taiga <em> listened </em> to his agony by the day.</p><p>All of it was rather ridiculous.</p><p>From what Taiga could see, Yugo liked him.</p><p>It was certainly in his own way, but as far as Taiga could tell, he liked him. </p><p>Yugo was like a closed shell that only let his utmost trusted ones see his soft spots. At work, he talked like nothing bothered him and nothing couldn't be solved, but he allowed Jesse to relieve his stress through more than sex. Through food. Through massages. Through late talks. Through drinks and drives to the ocean.</p><p>So did Yugo like him?</p><p>Taiga sure thought so.</p><p>Did Yugo know that he liked him?</p><p>Taiga wasn't so sure.</p><p>Either way, it didn't change the fact that Jesse continued to seek advice from him that he never took and never really sought. He just wanted someone to share his anguish and frankly, Taiga was growing tired of it.</p><p>But, throughout this whole ordeal, Taiga had one bit of solace.</p><p>That solace, being Matsumura Hokuto’s face.</p><p>Taiga liked to indulge in men, yes. That much was true. Jesse would go as far as to call him a “man-eater”, but Taiga resented the name.</p><p>A man-eater devoured men and spit out only bones and while Taiga did like to frequent bars and find men who fell for his pretty words or the touch of his skin, he really <em> really </em>did desire a genuine and loving relationship.</p><p>In many ways, Taiga was waiting for his Prince Charming to finally sweep him off his feet.</p><p>Taiga had dated many men before but none seemed to stick. He understood why women despised men because gay men were no different. Their brains were so riddled with sex and physical satisfaction that they hardly ever took a breath to say “I love you”.</p><p>He just wanted a handsome grounded man to fall in love with and for that man to simply fall in love with him so he could have his Happily Ever After.</p><p>And for a moment, after crashing to the floor in the hall of Yugo’s company office, Taiga had thought he had found his prince.</p><p>“Oh God. I-I’m so sorry, I wasn't looking and—”</p><p>It was the same man who was with Yugo during his presentation, but Taiga was too busy presenting the presentation itself to absorb anyone's faces.</p><p>It didn't matter if he remembered or not, in the end.</p><p>He sure as hell remembered it now.</p><p>It was hard to forget the face of a man who caught himself over him with only inches between their lips.</p><p>He was handsome.</p><p>Very handsome.</p><p>So handsome that Taiga didn't even feel the pain shooting up his hip and his shoulder.</p><p>“Are you okay–?”</p><p>Taiga was more than okay.</p><p>He was great as long as he could still smell the faint scent of his cologne.</p><p>“I'm fine. It's my fault for cutting around the corner so closely,” Taiga said with a smile as he rolled onto his back.</p><p>He wanted so badly to wrap his arms around the back of his neck and complete the kiss they didn't have, but they were in a professional setting and the others in the office wouldn't have appreciated a move so bold. </p><p>He sat up as Hokuto moved back, watching while Hokuto frantically looked around him.</p><p>The frames of the round glasses were cold against the back of Taiga’s fingers as he coincidentally bumped them with his hand.</p><p>“Is this what you're looking for?” </p><p>He held the glasses up between them, Hokuto squinting at first, but nodding quickly after.</p><p>“Yes, I'm so sorry about that. Thank you so much.”</p><p>“Yeah. Of course.”</p><p>Humans were easy to read. They were to Taiga, at least. It was a part of the reason why he was sent to do pitches and presentations so often.</p><p>Men were particularly easy to understand when it came to attraction. They were like fish. When bait is thrown and they're interested, then they’ll do their best to show they're interested.</p><p>And if they're not, then they won't bite. </p><p>Taiga tested the waters optimistically as he folded his hands over Hokuto’s when passing his glasses back to him.</p><p>… Only to have him lurch his hand back.</p><p>It was as if lightning would have struck if he had let Taiga’s hands linger for a moment longer.</p><p>Ah.</p><p>He was surely straight.</p><p>Even after putting on his glasses, Taiga felt like his appearance almost offended him with how quickly he looked away and scrambled to his feet, leaving Taiga with only a bow and alone, sitting on the monotone office floor.</p><p>So maybe this wasn't the start of his fairytale.</p><p>Maybe Matsumura Hokuto wasn't the prince that would wake him from his deep lonely sleep, but he was at least easy on the eyes when Taiga had to sit through long tiresome client meetings. </p><p>After all, Hokuto was attractive in ways he couldn't describe.</p><p>He had a simple face, but only if every feature on his image was crafted and molded by the hands of artisans. Every curve and line of his jaw, cheeks and brows were perfectly shaped, even as he anxiously adjusted his glasses on his shapely nose.</p><p>He was Taiga’s eye candy as he was just another straight man that would never fall in love him while Jesse continued to complain about how he and Yugo <em> still </em> weren't dating. </p><p>So.</p><p>Where did that leave them months later?</p><p>Somehow, it left them at Jesse's apartment after a drinking party to talk over a few more beers.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure how he got caught up in all of this. He was just trying to keep to himself after completely draining his social battery until Jesse suddenly called him over.</p><p>Hokuto had been forced to drink one too many drinks and he had to be taken home.</p><p>The restaurant was loud and Jesse’s story was long, but it summed up to “<em> blah blah blah </em> – something about Yugo taking Hokuto home, <em> blah blah </em> – Jesse wanting to spend more time with him and have him relax— <em> whatever whatever </em>— Jesse needed Taiga to help be there too.”</p><p>Okay. Sure.</p><p>Whatever got him away from the raging testosterone of his coworkers.</p><p>Jesse pulled a variety of alcohol from the fridge as they sat around his modest coffee table, letting Hokuto sleep on Jesse's bed while Taiga defiantly took the spot next to Yugo at the foot of the couch despite receiving a glare from their host. </p><p>Taiga couldn't care less.</p><p>Aside from having a proper view of Hokuto’s cute sleeping face from across the small apartment as he drank, he refused to be the third wheel sitting there alone in silence at the other side of the table while watching Jesse cuddle up next to a bright-cheeked Yugo.</p><p>Sure, Taiga might have <em> still </em> been drinking in silence, but at least he felt included in the conversation he hardly contributed to as it slowly began to grow stale with time.</p><p>It wasn't that Taiga was completely uninterested in Yugo’s leather craft hobby, but as stagnant as the conversation was to Taiga’s drunken ears, Taiga’s drunken mind couldn't help but become frustrated with the stagnation of their lives as he swallowed down his beer.</p><p>Jesse liked Yugo.</p><p>Yugo liked Jesse (maybe).</p><p>For how long has Taiga told Jesse to just <em> tell </em>him?</p><p>If it had only been weeks, then it felt like months since Taiga had been drilling the same advice into Jesse, only for him to not listen and complain again just the next day.</p><p>Taiga was sick of waiting for his prince to wake him.</p><p>He even found a prince he <em> wished </em> would wake him, but this prince would never kiss him while Jesse had his princess laying before him in a bed of flowers, waiting, but simply refused to wake him up.</p><p>Taiga tapped his nails against his can.</p><p>He wasn't ready to listen to Jesse complain about Yugo for the rest of his life.</p><p>He wasn't ready to watch Jesse refuse to take a relationship that was sitting in wait that Taiga would take in a heartbeat.</p><p>Tonight, Taiga had enough.</p><p>Tonight, Taiga was drunk.</p><p>Tonight, he didn't care.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Tonight, he wanted to light a fire under Jesse's ass.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga swirled what little was left in his drink before setting it down just loud enough to pull attention.</p><p>He smiled an apology that didn't last long as he grabbed another, the aluminum lip snapping open.</p><p>“So, Yugo— If I can call you that…”</p><p>Yugo blinked when he felt a heat bump against his shoulder, only to find Taiga nestled up beside him with both of their backs resting against the foot of the couch.</p><p>Maybe it was just the alcohol, but Yugo couldn't help but catch his eyes on how pretty Taiga’s fingers looked, gracefully holding his can from the top while his peachy pink lips took a sip from the rim. </p><p>“Sure,” Yugo said, taking another nip of his own drink. “If I can call you Taiga.”</p><p>Taiga chuckled as he smiled.</p><p>A bite.</p><p>“Yugo and Taiga it is, then.”</p><p>The can was cold as Taiga tapped his drink against Yugo’s knee while he folded his own up against his chest before suddenly taking his hand in his. </p><p>Yugo usually would have flinched at the sudden action, but the warm buzz in his body made Taiga’s fingers that were cool and lightly dampened from his drink feel soothing against his skin.</p><p>“Since you were talking about how to work with leather, I couldn't help but notice how nice your hands are.”</p><p>Taiga had his hand cradled in his, their palms together, before he used his other to run the pads of his fingers up the back as he still held his drink. He traced the veins and defined peaks and valleys on his skin with his pinky, middle, and index.</p><p>“Even your nails are so shiny and shapely. Has anyone told you this before?”</p><p>Yugo’s finger twitched as he stayed quiet for a moment, watching the way Taiga slowly curled his fingers under his middle digit with just the ends of his own, as if it was something gentle and precious as he carefully followed the curves in his knuckles up to his nail bed. </p><p>“... Not particularly.”</p><p>Taiga blinked before he laughed, his hand threading comfortably with Yugo’s, Yugo unable to ignore how long and thin Taiga’s fingers looked tucked between his.</p><p>“Really? I would have imagined Jesse would have said something by now.”</p><p>“You two are dating after all, right?”</p><p>Jesse choked.</p><p>Taiga really knew how to stick the knife in where it hurt.</p><p>But Jesse hadn't expected Yugo to twist the blade.</p><p>“No, it's not like that.”</p><p>Taiga raised a brow as if he didn't already know. Of course, he already knew, but Jesse knew it wouldn’t keep him from asking anyway.</p><p>“Then what are you two exactly? Friends with benefits or more like—…?” Taiga waved his hand, wanting words to finish his sentence.</p><p>Jesse started quickly. “We’re just—” </p><p>Though somehow, even with his body full of liquor, Yugo replied faster as he shifted his legs to get more comfortable.</p><p>And maybe just a touch closer to Taiga.</p><p>“More the former than the latter.”</p><p>“Ahh…” Taiga mused as he tapped his can back against his lip, his hand still locked with Yugo’s.</p><p>“So… How's the sex?”</p><p>This time, Jesse nearly coughed up his whole mouthful of highball.</p><p>Taiga had prodded him about his sex with Yugo before and Jesse avoided answering him for a reason. He knew that Taiga only asked to pick on him and he didn't want to add anything to the arsenal Taiga already had to use against him, but there was nothing that would stop Yugo’s lips that were loose with alcohol.</p><p>He just hoped Yugo was short with his words and Taiga didn't pry as he shot a glare in response to the pleased smile Taiga flashed his way.</p><p>“It's good.”</p><p>“Hmm? Oh really?” Taiga hummed as if he hadn't heard Jesse say that over and over. </p><p>“How good?”</p><p>“Very good. He’s rough when he needs to be and gentle when it's right.”</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but laugh, not only at Yugo’s blunt honesty but also the red that began to burn on Jesse's cheeks as Taiga covered his smirk with the back of his hand.</p><p>“Yeah? Does he talk dirty?”</p><p>He was half joking, but Yugo pondered it seriously, emptying the rest of his can into his mouth as Taiga took and opened another for him to Jesse's displeasure.</p><p>“Taiga– Can we—” Jesse tried to cut in, wanting to halt the conversation in its tracks.</p><p>But Yugo cut back over him.</p><p>“Sometimes. Usually when I'm about to—”</p><p>“Kochi!!!”</p><p>Taiga laughed again, hiding his elation behind his drink and wrist as he nudged himself into Yugo’s shoulder again with a squeeze of his hand.</p><p>“Oh come on, Jess. We’re all just having a good time here, right Yugo? It's okay if we share a few details here and there.”</p><p>The way Taiga smiled at him made it hard for Yugo to disagree. He nodded while Taiga beamed at him in what his eyes saw as kindness, but what Jesse saw as poison.</p><p>Taiga wasn't a bad person. No, it wasn't like he was going to commit murder. He did everything right and he paid his taxes on time. He always tried to be a good friend and wanted to be a good friend.</p><p>He just wanted to show Jesse that patience wasn't <em> always </em>so rewarding.</p><p>“You know… There's been something I've been wondering about,” Taiga sighed as he set down his can. “And I was thinking that maybe Yugo was the perfect person to help me figure it out…”</p><p>Yugo blinked as Taiga reached over him, gently slipping his drink from his hand to place neatly on the table beside his own.</p><p>“Sure?... What is it?”</p><p>“I've been wanting to know who's the better kisser.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Jesse knew what Taiga was doing.</p><p>Oh, he knew <em> exactly </em> what he was doing.</p><p>Taiga always had a way with his words. He knew how to direct people exactly where he wanted them to be and exactly where they wanted to go. Jesse had seen them be particularly influential as Taiga whispered them into the ears of unfamiliar men under the strobes of waving colored lights.</p><p>He didn't like where this was going.</p><p>Jesse had every sense to stand up and pull Yugo out of the trap that Taiga was slowly spindling.</p><p>But the way Taiga tucked Yugo’s hair behind his ear, tracing his fingers along the shell, made his throat turn dry and his muscles seize as he sat there wordlessly, only to watch.</p><p>“Jess and I sometimes argue about who's better at kissing. Of course, both of us think that ourselves are better but it's not like we're going to kiss each other. That's just gross, right?”</p><p>“I… guess…?”</p><p>It was like a venom the way Taiga leaned into him, his gaze trailing along the curve of Yugo’s jawline, down his neck, and to his pronounced collarbone Jesse had once raved about looking so enticing.</p><p>Taiga’s fingertips followed the lines down Yugo’s neck before settling gently along the base as Taiga smiled, finding Yugo’s eyes trained on his lips.</p><p>Why did he never notice how long Yugo’s lashes were before?</p><p>How cute.</p><p>“Since the two of you are just sex friends, it's okay if we kiss, isn't it?”</p><p>“I—”</p><p>No.</p><p>No, it wasn't okay.</p><p>It absolutely wasn't okay.</p><p>And Jesse knew that <em> Taiga </em>knew it wasn't okay.</p><p>But that didn't keep Taiga’s head from tilting to softly catch Yugo’s lips.</p><p>Taiga knew how to kiss.</p><p>Boy, did Taiga know how to kiss.</p><p>Jesse had seen Taiga make the most prideful and masculine of men weak at the knees with the way he kissed.</p><p>The moment their lips touched, they were already trapped in his web. </p><p>He saw how Taiga gently molded Yugo’s bottom lip between his own, catching the soft skin with a light tug before rocking them back together once more. </p><p>Taiga caught his prey with his hands, cradling their jaw and caressing their neck to keep the focus of every sensation and blissful touch on him and him only.</p><p>And when Taiga would pull away for a moment, his long lashes fluttering open to meet the gaze of his victim, he knew he had won every time from just the look in their eyes.</p><p>Taiga huffed a quiet laugh through his nose as Yugo cupped his neck to pull their lips back together, but not before Taiga made sure to catch Jesse’s stare before closing his eyes again with a smirk.</p><p>Hook.</p><p>Line.</p><p>Sinker.</p><p>At first, it was just a kiss.</p><p>It was just a simple kiss, just both of them enjoying the soft pillowiness of the other’s lips with the warmth of their buzz, slowly moving and rolling together with the noses brushing and bumping when they sought a different angle the other complied to.</p><p>They explored the touch of each other's heat, mixing long prolonged rocks with quick pecks and gentle sighs as they slowly grew lost.</p><p>Jesse couldn't help but stare at the way Yugo parted his mouth with Taiga's, only exchanging breaths before Taiga nudged them together to take the sweet sound of their kisses from his lips. </p><p>He couldn't look away.</p><p>It was like watching a building burn. </p><p>It was devastating, watching the flames engulf a home, burning and destroying precious items with its flames, claiming in its embers what could never be whole again.</p><p>But the heat and the glare of the blaze was entrancing. Hypnotizing. Mesmerizing.</p><p>A lovely destruction as Taiga licked Yugo’s rosy lips which parted easily with his own tongue out and eager to meet with Taiga’s.</p><p>The sounds that were once sweet slowly became dirty, slick and wet, as they filled Jesse’s small apartment, echoing off the walls while Jesse only sat and watched the glimpses of their rolling tongues.</p><p>Their interlocked hands fell apart as Taiga slid his hand behind Yugo’s neck, his fingers tangling with his dark hair, encouraging the smooth rhythm of their crashing tongues and catching lips while Yugo pulled at Taiga’s waist, urging him closer. </p><p>Yugo’s chin raised, bumping together their bruising lips as Jesse saw how his adam’s apple bobbed, swallowing down his and Taiga’s kiss. </p><p>Jesse hated this. </p><p>He hated every moment of this. </p><p>He wanted to grab Taiga and tear them apart.</p><p>He wanted Yugo’s lips to be his and his alone and the cute breathy moans he gave at the end of each kiss to be for his ears and his ears only to hear.</p><p>But he couldn't.</p><p>Jesse couldn't because he couldn't deny the way his heart was pounding and his blood was racing. </p><p>It was hot.</p><p>It was undeniably hot.</p><p>No matter how angry he was at Taiga, he couldn't stop his eyes from following the trail of saliva that rolled down Yugo’s chin from between their lips and the web that formed between their tongues. He couldn't stop staring at how Yugo seemed to shudder, gripping into Taiga’s clothes every time Taiga nipped at his swollen skin.</p><p>Taiga was picking on him, sure, but he was also doing him a service. </p><p>He gave him service by slipping his fingers under Yugo’s shirt collar, exposing more of his slender shoulders and gentle skin as he showed Jesse just how much Yugo loved to have his tongue sucked. He even made time to present him Yugo’s narrow frame as he dragged his hand up Yugo’s torso, pressing his shirt close to his skin and the sensual curve of his neck by pulling back the base of his hair between his fingers.</p><p>And when Yugo pulled Taiga down with him to the floor, Jesse had to fight the heat that started to pool below his belt.</p><p>There was no question that Jesse found Yugo attractive. He wouldn't fantasize about him and their nights alone so much if he didn't, but no matter how platonic his and Taiga’s friendship was, if anyone ever asked him if he thought Taiga was good looking, he would never say no.</p><p>Taiga had an undeniable allure to his body and his composure that Jesse couldn't deny. It was almost like a switch he turned off day and night.</p><p>By day, he was a stern professional who kept his tie tightened flush to his collar. </p><p>At night, he was a monster that swallowed men whole.</p><p>So what did that mean?</p><p>Well, the math was simple, wasn't it? </p><p>Two attractive people making out on the floor before him turned Jesse on in a way he hated but couldn't stop.</p><p>Jesse just sat with his slowly warming highball in his hand, watching Taiga push up Yugo’s shirt above his waist, kissing his neck as Yugo’s thin leg threaded between Taiga’s thighs, tangling them together.</p><p>If Jesse hadn't known that Taiga wasn't anything but an absolute bottom, he would have been more worried, but like this, watching Yugo and Taiga kiss was more akin to watching two curious straight girls make out for fun rather than leading to sex. They simply indulged in the feel of each other’s bodies in their drunken stupor over seeking a release. Even as Yugo dipped his fingers under the band of Taiga’s bottoms, it was only to feel the curve on his hip while Taiga sighed gleefully into Yugo’s skin.</p><p>“Good?” Taiga whispered, running his tongue over the soft spot under Yugo’s ear before nipping lightly at the edge of his jaw. </p><p>Yugo answered after Taiga pulled back, making the better choice to not leave hickies on his client's skin, nudging at Taiga’s chin to lead their lips to lock again. </p><p>It made Taiga grin as he dug his fingers into Yugo’s hair, humming with a pleased chuckle at the top of his throat from Yugo raising his knee up further between his legs, shifting him further up onto his lap. </p><p>Yugo dragged his fingers over Taiga’s milky skin, leaving pink trails from just the pressure over his back as he muttered hotly between a flick of their tongues.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>It must have been the whisky that made Jesse consider just for a moment that this was okay. That a threesome would be okay as he watched them trace and follow the dips and curves of each other's bodies on the floor of his apartment, listening to the quiet moans and wet sounds that escaped their tangled tongues.</p><p><em> Maybe </em> he'd be okay if he shared Yugo for just one night.</p><p><em> Maybe </em> it'd be okay to have Taiga whisper filth into Yugo’s ear as he pleasured Yugo’s body.</p><p><em> Maybe </em>he’d be alright letting Yugo get lost in Taiga’s kiss as he took him behind.</p><p><em> Maybe </em> he could imagine them, both on their knees before him, looking up at him as he—</p><p>Jesse was broken from his fantasies when a loud thump came from behind him.</p><p>It sobered him as well as rushed his blood back to all the appropriate places as he spun around, finding Hokuto on his knees at the foot of his bed, his hands grasping the sheets to stabilize him.</p><p>“Hokuto–”</p><p>He had honestly forgotten about him.</p><p>The other two had clearly forgotten too as they separated, getting to their feet. </p><p>Jesse came over, helping Hokuto sit at the side of his bed. “Hey, are you alright? You drank a little too much at the party…”</p><p>Hokuto held his head, the reminisces of the alcohol still making it throb.</p><p>“Where am I?...” </p><p>“Jesse's place,” Yugo said, placing a bottle of water with the seal already cracked into Hokuto’s hand. “I was going to take you back but Jesse offered to let you rest here while we shared a few more drinks.”</p><p>“What time is it—?”</p><p>“About half past eleven,” Taiga chimed from behind them, brushing his lips with the back of his hand.</p><p>Hokuto looked around him. “I-... I should head home,” he muttered, quietly thanking Jesse after he passed him his glasses from the bedside table. “It's late and I have to go into the office tomorrow. Don't worry about me, don't let me interrupt. I can take myself to the station–”</p><p>Yugo held out his hand to help him up. “No, Hokuto. Let me take you. You still look a little shaky and I–”</p><p>“No–!” </p><p>They looked at Jesse who had cut into their already scattered talk. </p><p>It was about on par for how smoothly four inebriated men could carry on a conversation, but Jesse held up his hand, asking for a pause before grabbing Taiga by the arm and dragging him to the kitchen area to hurriedly whisper at him with their backs turned to the others. </p><p>“I need you to take Hokuto home.”</p><p>Taiga wasn't wholly against that idea, but because it was Jesse telling him to, he retorted.</p><p>“Why should I?”</p><p>“Because you owe me after that stunt.” </p><p>“I wouldn't have to pull that kind of stunt if you just told Kochi you like him.”</p><p>“Taiga, I don't want to argue with you about this right now.”</p><p>“Well if you two were dating, I wouldn't kiss him, but as long as you two aren't—”</p><p>“Taiga, <em> please</em>.”</p><p>Taiga sighed. </p><p>“Admit I kiss better then.”</p><p>“Fine. Yes. You kiss better.”</p><p>Taiga tapped the back of his hand against Jesse’s chest.</p><p>“Did you think it was hot?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“You did, didn't you?”</p><p>“I won't say.”</p><p>“And now you want more <em> alone </em> time with Kochi?”</p><p>“Just take Hokuto home already.”</p><p>Jesse pivoted as Taiga pushed at his shoulder, bringing them to face the two who remained confused at the other side of the apartment.</p><p>“You take a moment and rest, Kochi,” Taiga said with a smile suited for the office, as if they <em> hadn't </em>been making out heavily moments ago. “I'll bring Matsumura to the station. It's about time I head home too.”</p><p>Yugo turned to him with a moment's hesitation as he brought Hokuto onto his feet. “Are you sure? He's my coworker after all, it should be my responsibility…”</p><p>Taiga shook his head. “No, it's quite alright. I'm more familiar with the area anyhow. You haven't had a break in a while, right? Take your time with Jesse. I'll make sure he's on the train safely.”</p><p>“Are you okay with that, Hokuto?” Yugo asked, to which Hokuto replied with a nod.</p><p>“You did say you wanted to unwind this weekend. The nap helped me sober up enough to get home.” </p><p>“Alright…”</p><p>Taiga went to the doorway with Hokuto close behind. He slipped on his shoes first before he held out his hand to help Hokuto keep steady for him to do his own.</p><p>And when Hokuto didn't take it, Taiga unlocked the door instead.</p><p>If Jesse didn't wake his princess soon, then Taiga really would kiss Yugo again, though Jesse surely would be kissing Yugo tonight after that to help him <em> unwind </em> as Hokuto said. </p><p>They said their goodnights and stepped out the door, sending a shudder down their spines as they entered the chill of the evening air.</p><p>No words were shared between them, but even still, Taiga made sure to walk down the stairs carefully in front of Hokuto, making sure that if his foot did catch or slip, he would be able to catch him.</p><p>The station was only a few blocks away. By the time they reached it, the cool temperature should be enough to burn away enough of their drunkenness to take them safely home alone.</p><p>“This way.”</p><p>They walked side by side, albeit with some space between them, but with the empty sidewalks, there was no sin in taking up a bit more room.</p><p>It let Taiga steal glances at the pink hue that still stained the curve of Hokuto’s ears as they walked under the streetlights in silence.</p><p>Cute.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>Taiga blinked, looking over to Hokuto who’s eyes were trained on the approaching station before them.</p><p>He didn't expect him to talk, but he was happy to listen to his low smooth tenor, regardless of what it was.</p><p>“D-... Do you… kiss a lot of people like that?”</p><p>Taiga couldn't remember the last time he felt this embarrassed.</p><p>It was no secret to his close friends that this kind of debauchery wasn't uncommon for him, but for someone like Hokuto to have seen him behave so unabashedly, he almost felt ashamed.</p><p>“You saw that?”</p><p>Hokuto nodded.</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“I woke up when I heard something fall to the floor.”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Wind blew past them as they descended the stairs with the blinding white station lights cutting through the night.</p><p>Taiga laughed apologetically as he tapped his pass card to open the gate.</p><p>“I'm sorry you had to see that.”</p><p>“No, it's fine. I was just curious.”</p><p>Taiga's train was on the left and Hokuto’s was on the right.</p><p>This is where they parted.</p><p>“Well, I don't kiss everyone I know. I kiss some people for fun but it doesn't have to mean much. It's just playing around, you know, just–” Taiga tried to explain.</p><p>But Hokuto just stayed quietly listening, as if waiting for something Taiga wasn't sure of as their eyes met.</p><p>Taiga trailed off. </p><p>If he had blinked, he might have missed it.</p><p>Though his eyes still closed when Hokuto leaned in. </p><p>It happened so fast Taiga wasn't really sure it even happened, as if his drunken brain had created visions and the illusion of the warm touch on his lips. </p><p>But the way Hokuto lingered after their lips parted made a second feel like it could have lasted minutes.</p><p>Taiga sighed a breath as Hokuto drew away, the momentary bravery given to him by his drunkenness and the charm of Taiga’s pink and swollen lips fading away, his eyes darting from his.</p><p>“... Goodnight, Kyomoto.”</p><p>Taiga could only nod.</p><p>“Goodnight, Matsumura.”</p><p>Hokuto’s heels clacked and echoed off the station walls as he walked away, leaving Taiga alone before the gates, watching his back grow distant.</p><p>Once Hokuto disappeared down the stairs, Taiga collapsed, doubling over and hugging his knees to his chest.</p><p>The station music started to play, announcing the departure of his train, but he couldn't bring himself to care. He wanted to scream.</p><p>He buried his face in his hands.</p><p>“Please come and wake me already…”</p><p><br/>

<p>“I love you.”</p><p>“Huh?...”</p><p>Ah. He finally said it.</p><p>It finally came out on a whim as Jesse couldn't hold back his feelings anymore.</p><p>They had been on the verge of bursting for months and with only a few weeks left of their contract, what he feared the most was that they would part ways without another word or acknowledgement of what they had.</p><p>Jesse loved Yugo and he only fell more in love with him with every laugh, kiss and gentle moment Yugo let himself relax in his hold.</p><p>Just as Taiga told him, he wanted to believe Yugo was in love with him too.</p><p>In many ways, Yugo showed that he loved him.</p><p>It was just a matter of Jesse getting past his fear of rejection to finally say it.</p><p>Though, this wasn't exactly how Jesse <em> or </em> Yugo imagined it happening.</p><p>Jesse had hoped it would have been a little more romantic than when they were fucking in a bathroom stall after their meeting.</p><p>But feelings were feelings and feelings came out when they may, even if those feelings were all sourced from Yugo thanking him for last night just a bit too sweetly along with him running his foot up the back of his calf one too many times under the large meeting table.</p><p>Yugo sputtered out a laugh as Jesse hid his face against his shoulder, his chuckle melting in with the soft groan that pulled from his throat when Jesse sank into him just a bit deeper in their pause.</p><p>He didn't think it was possible for someone to flush any darker when they were already in the midst of public sex.</p><p>“Did you really have to say it like this?... Now?...”</p><p>Yugo hooked his leg up on Jesse’s hip, moving slowly to not make the toilet seat clatter under him as he threw his arms around Jesse’s shoulders.</p><p>He had fallen in love with Jesse a long time ago.</p><p>Whether or not he liked it, he was falling faster than he ever could have imagined.</p><p>He didn't like to depend on people. He especially didn't like to depend on them like a crutch that would leave him falling to the floor if it were to ever be swept out from underneath him.</p><p>In all honesty, he didn't want to fall in love. It would have been better if Jesse would have been just a man who could have been replaced by any other tall boy with washboard abs who was willing to fuck him until he forgot all his stress.</p><p>Yugo didn't want to have a crutch.</p><p>But Jesse held him at night in a way that became addictive.</p><p>Jesse kissed him in ways that were so much more than a kiss.</p><p>Jesse softened down his sharp edges that he never knew were sharp with how he ran to him with just a text.</p><p>If Yugo were to have a crutch, then he didn't want any other besides this one, especially since he knew that this one would never dare to leave him.</p><p>Yugo buried his fingers into Jesse’s dress shirt as he kissed his neck, feeling the gentle perspiration on his skin that built from being locked in a small stall.</p><p>“I love you too, Jesse.”</p><p>Jesse wrapped his arms around him, tightly pulling Yugo against him as his hips refused to keep from bucking, making Yugo huff hotly against his skin with a smile.</p><p>“Just tell me again once we're home alone.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s eyes lulled shut.</p><p>His chin rested in his palm as he started to drift, his head growing heavy.</p><p>He swayed until his elbow hit his cup of pens, the sound of scattered plastic spilling over his desk jolting him awake.</p><p>“... Taiga, are you okay?...”</p><p>Taiga glanced up at Jesse across from him as he rubbed his eyes hurriedly while placing the cup back straight on his desk.</p><p>“Yeah– Yeah. I'm fine,” he said with a sharp inhale.</p><p>In reality, he wasn't fine.</p><p>He was doing kind of bad, actually.</p><p>Taiga hadn't been getting much sleep.</p><p>He had been busy drowning himself in his work because he didn't want to know what his brain would do when it was idle.</p><p>After he and Hokuto had shared that brief and momentary kiss, Taiga was on some sort of cloud nine.</p><p>He wasn't sure what it meant and he wasn't sure if it would happen again, but he couldn't keep himself from wanting to believe it could have been something more than just a drunken kiss.</p><p>Perhaps, Hokuto wasn't straight.</p><p>Maybe, he had fallen for him.</p><p>Maybe, they could get to know each other and fall in love.</p><p>Maybe, Hokuto would wake him from his lonely sleep.</p><p>Taiga had hesitantly hoped, keeping the greatest of his expectations buried deep while trying to keep his reality anchored to the ground. He greeted Hokuto in the mornings with a smile and when Hokuto didn't meet his eye, Taiga made sure to question his fantasies to make sure he stayed in check.</p><p>It was always good to give himself a rude awakening. It was better to receive it from himself than anyone else, in the end.</p><p>Hokuto turning away didn't have to mean he was feeling shy. He could also be embarrassed. Ashamed. Even confused by what he did.</p><p>It didn't have to mean attraction.</p><p>As long as he kept his expectations low, he wouldn't get hurt, right?...</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Because regardless of his expectations, Taiga still had hope, no matter how small or restrained.</p><p>And when Taiga saw Hokuto kiss a woman a week later in the streets of Kabukicho, it all came apart.</p><p>Taiga felt every breath get taken from his chest.</p><p>People swarmed between them in the busy street as Taiga saw the woman hold his cheek to prolong their kiss far longer than the momentary bliss he had that night.</p><p>So.</p><p>It meant nothing.</p><p>Their kiss meant nothing.</p><p>… Figures.</p><p>The street light changed to green, but Taiga didn't cross.</p><p>He went home instead of meeting his friend for dinner.</p><p>He didn't have the appetite anyway.</p><p>He just showered and got in bed with an empty stomach.</p><p>He and Hokuto had only kissed once after they both had too much to drink.</p><p>It was stupid to think it could have been anything more.</p><p>It was stupid to be hurt by it.</p><p>They only kissed once.</p><p>They never were anything and it never was anything.</p><p>It shouldn't hurt so much.</p><p>But it didn't change the fact that it did.</p><p>The next morning, Taiga decided to take a note from Yugo and simply drown himself in his work.</p><p>He had never been so productive.</p><p>He finished his own work early and even picked up on assisting on other projects that were falling behind.</p><p>Taiga got up early and went home late, leaving little room to ponder before he quickly fell asleep.</p><p>It certainly made the days blow by as the end of their contract with Yugo’s office rapidly approached.</p><p>All those months ago, Taiga thought their last day would be difficult.</p><p>When Hokuto came crashing into him with that cute shocked expression as he fell over him, he thought he would hate the last day he would be able to see his face, but now it felt more like tearing off a bandage.</p><p>It was the end to the beginning that never started.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Taiga would just move on to the next straight man that wouldn't love him.</p><p>He yawned as he stretched his arms over his head, scrunching his nose as the exhaustion refused to leave his body. His glasses clattered on his nose as he rubbed his eyes, leaving his vision blurry while he tried to refocus on his laptop screen.</p><p>“When was the last time you took a break?...” Jesse asked before checking his watch across from him.</p><p>Work hours were just about over.</p><p>Still, Taiga just waved his hand, finishing his previously abandoned email before opening pitch notes a newer hire sent him to proof read. “Oh I don't know…”</p><p>“Like… ten months ago?”</p><p>“Ten months ago???”</p><p>Jesse’s jaw almost dropped open.</p><p>This wasn't the Kyomoto Taiga he knew.</p><p>The Kyomoto Taiga he knew did everything at his own pace and his own time. It had always been an efficient pace and an agreeable time, but it was still his, nonetheless.</p><p>Taiga wasn't one who sacrificed himself to the corporate shackles of society.</p><p>Even without the sleepiness and late nights, that was enough to believe something was wrong.</p><p>Jesse frowned as he closed his laptop before sending off a quick text. “When was the last time you went out for a night?”</p><p>Taiga just shrugged.</p><p>“I have no idea. It's been a while? It's not as fun when I have to go there alone.”</p><p>Jesse tucked his phone into his pocket. “You never seemed to mind going alone before…”</p><p>“But that's because you were <em> busy </em> , not because you were <em> taken </em>,” Taiga sighed, pushing his knuckle into his temple with his eyes still on his screen. “At least before I knew you would go eventually, but now you'll never go.”</p><p>“Go where?”</p><p>Taiga and Jesse looked over to find Yugo at their table. He was already packed up with his work bag on his shoulder and his jacket on over his suit, ready to head home for the night.</p><p>Head home with Jesse, surely.</p><p>Why else would he be here otherwise?</p><p>Taiga rubbed the bridge of his nose before typing in a comment into the document on his screen as Jesse walked around his chair to go to him. “Ah. We were just talking about clubbing.”</p><p>“Oh?” Yugo adjusted his bag. “Were you two thinking about going?”</p><p>“No, no. Taiga was just talking about how I never go with him anymore.”</p><p>“You don't? Why not?”</p><p>“Well–... Yugo,” Jesse said timidly with a chuckle. “You know why—”</p><p>Taiga tried to not audibly sigh.</p><p>He was happy for them.</p><p>He really was.</p><p>Over their time of working together, Taiga felt quite close to Yugo now and considered him as a close friend. He was happy to see how the stress slowly melted from his body and his stiff personality began to loosen up. It was great seeing how much being with Jesse had improved his life in so many ways.</p><p>It just hurt a little as it paid a reminder to Taiga of just how single he still was.</p><p>He was still waiting for his prince.</p><p>He was still waiting to be woken from his sleep.</p><p>He had been kissed once.</p><p>It just wasn't from the prince that was meant to wake him.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Well... If Jesse doesn't want to go, then I don't mind going with you instead.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga blinked, spinning around in his chair.</p><p>Jesse was just as shocked as they both had the same response.</p><p>“Huh???”</p><p>Yugo just shrugged as he pulled out his phone to glance at his schedule. “Why not? It's been a while since I've gone to a club. I feel like it could be a good time.”</p><p>“But Yugo– you aren't gonna–” Jesse stammered. He knew what Yugo had gone to the club for before, as he was the one who received his desires, but Yugo eased him with heavy pats against his chest.</p><p>“No, I won't do anything like that. It's just for some drinks and fun.”</p><p>“Then I’ll go too–”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yugo smiled, leaving both Taiga and Jesse speechless as Yugo went and closed the top of Taiga’s laptop.</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure if it was his lack of sleep that was playing tricks on him, but the smile Yugo gave him as he pulled him by the arm, up out of his seat, almost looked like a reflection of himself.</p><p>Kind.</p><p>But scheming.</p><p>Something deeper as his grip stayed on his arm.</p><p>“I’ll just go with Taiga,” Yugo said as he handed Taiga his coat. “You won't worry when I'm with him, right? I won't run away with any strangers.”</p><p>Jesse looked quickly between them, though Taiga wasn't sure what kind of answer he was looking for in his eyes.</p><p>He was honestly just as confused.</p><p>“I-... I guess–”</p><p>Yugo beamed. “Great!”</p><p>“Then let's go tonight.”</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure he heard correctly. “Tonight???”</p><p>Yugo nodded. “Tonight. As a congratulations for all your hard work on our contract.”</p><p>Taiga motioned to stop Yugo from putting his laptop away for him, but he didn't have enough energy to actually keep him from doing it as he tried to use words instead.</p><p>“But I said I would finish this edit—”</p><p>“Is it due tomorrow?”</p><p>“No, but-”</p><p>“Then it can be done later.”</p><p>Yugo had his usual smile when he pushed Taiga’s bag against his chest and promptly took his hand to pull him to the elevators.</p><p>Taiga just stared at him, speechless, as he watched Yugo tell Jesse to head home without him. It was only by the time Yugo was pressing the elevator button that Taiga got himself to speak.</p><p>“A-are we going now?? Like this??”</p><p>It wasn't unheard of, though it wasn't often that people went to the club in their work clothes, but still, Yugo laughed as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>“Of course not,” he said, giving Taiga a little push on his back to enter the lobby floor and out the front doors.</p><p>“But we have money to spare, don't we?”</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>From all the stories Jesse had told him, he knew that Yugo had a side to him he hid from the office, but Taiga had no idea just how playful it could be when he bought them both matching silk shirts at the adjacent department store before herding him to the train station.</p><p>After a connecting train, a few stops, and changing clothes in a bathroom stall, it was just the right time for the shadows of nightlife to begin filling the streets as Yugo led them to their usual club where he bought Taiga his first drink.</p><p>The music was pounding as it always was. The people were as liberated as they always were.</p><p>But Taiga couldn't help but be hesitant.</p><p>He looked down at his glass as Yugo placed it on the small standing table they found to share in the back.</p><p>“Kochi… Are you sure this is okay?... Wouldn't it have been better if Jesse came? He seemed a little dejected—”</p><p>Yugo just waved his hand, chiming his glass off the rim of Taiga’s. “No, I just wanted it to be the two of us.”</p><p>“But–”</p><p>“You wouldn't tell me what's wrong otherwise, right?”</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>“... Huh?”</p><p>“If you wanted Jesse to know, you would have told him by now.”</p><p>His smile was still as vibrant even when shrouded in a dim room with strobing lights.</p><p>When did Yugo get so sharp?...</p><p>Or maybe he had always been this sharp, but Taiga was just foolish enough not to notice.</p><p>He couldn't help but laugh a little.</p><p>“Why are you watching me so closely? Do you have a crush on me or something? I don't go out with taken men.”</p><p>Yugo laughed with him as he nudged the hand Taiga had on his glass, encouraging him to drink. “Not at all. I'm just observant of the ones I care about.”</p><p>“Oh, and you care about me too?” Taiga said with a smile, his lip against his glass of lemon sour before taking a drink. “Wow, this really does feel like a confession.”</p><p>Yugo leaned into the small bar table, watching Taiga’s long lashes flutter open as his drink parted from his lips.</p><p>He waited for Taiga to set down his glass before he spoke.</p><p>“You like Hokuto, don't you?”</p><p>If Taiga had any of his drink left in his mouth, he would have coughed it up. Instead, he choked on the last stray drops that lingered, burning at the top of his throat before swallowing it all down.</p><p>Yugo certainly saw right through him.</p><p>Jeez.</p><p>What else did Yugo know about him?</p><p>“You can tell–?” Taiga pressed his hand to the back of his lips, forcing the fire down.</p><p>Yugo just laughed. “Well you stare at him like a highschool girl with a crush…”</p><p>“Tell me again how you didn't know Jesse wanted to date you?”</p><p>“Hey, this isn't about me anymore, it's about you.”</p><p>Taiga sighed as he stared back into his drink.</p><p>He watched the flashing colors of the club glow in its reflection as the base of the loud music pounded in his chest.</p><p>“‘Liked’...”</p><p>Yugo perked up, listening.</p><p>“‘Liked’ is probably a better word.”</p><p>“... Why?” Yugo asked.</p><p>Taiga let out a long breath, holding his cheek in his hand as he propped his elbow up on the table. “He has a girlfriend, doesn't he?”</p><p>Yugo looked up in thought, taking a sip of his own drink. “Does he?...”</p><p>“I saw him kiss a girl in Kabukicho.”</p><p>“Hm. That doesn't sound like the Hokuto I know… Are you sure it was him?”</p><p>Taiga nodded. “He had the same work bag and everything. It was definitely him.”</p><p>“But what if it was just a one time thing? What if they're not dating?”</p><p>“It doesn't matter either way. He's straight. It doesn't change anything.”</p><p>“So you're giving up?”</p><p>“I <em> have </em> given up…”</p><p>Taiga knocked back the rest of his glass.</p><p>There was no point getting caught up on something that would never happen.</p><p>He wasn't going to be one of those gay boys who waited for years, hoping that their highschool crush would suddenly bat for the same team so they could fall in love and adopt kids together.</p><p>Life was no fairytale.</p><p>“Hey! Another lemon sour please!” Taiga called, waving at the bartender.</p><p>No prince would come and sweep him off his feet.</p><p>No prince would come to rescue him and wake him from his slumber.</p><p>So what reason was there to wait as if he would ever come?</p><p>“I'm sorry, Taiga,” Yugo said as a waiter came with Taiga’s drink.</p><p>He observed how Taiga leaned in to speak to the waiter much closer than anyone needed to, telling him his tab with a smile and a teasing pull at his sleeve to undo the gold cuff that held it in place.</p><p>“It's fine.” Taiga kept his eyes on the waiter for as long as it took for the waiter’s gaze to leave his own before taking a sip off the top of his new drink.</p><p>“That's life.”</p><p>Yugo smiled with a sigh before taking his cup and throwing it back.</p><p>Taiga watched as Yugo drained it down, his adam's apple rolling in his throat with each swallow before he set it down like a statement.</p><p>He pushed his spent drink against Taiga’s previously emptied glass as he raised his hand to get the attention of the bar.</p><p>Without words, Taiga knew that for tonight, they were in solidarity as Yugo gave him a smile and returned his same words.</p><p>“That's life.”</p><p>And tonight, they got drunk.</p><p>

</p><p>The drunker Taiga got, the sharper his tongue became.</p><p>If he had the time, he would have convinced every man in the club that he was into them and that every single one of them <em> should </em> be into him.</p><p>Even the men that came to make their pass at Yugo were lured away by the look Taiga gave over the rim of his glass or the swipe of his tongue on the polished ice, which Jesse would have been thankful for had he been there.</p><p>But perhaps his thanks would have been counteracted by the drinks Taiga got for free that then went into Yugo’s stomach.</p><p>The man at their table locked his eyes on the curling of Taiga’s shapely lips as Taiga tugged at the very end of his collar, bumping gently up beside him with the curve of his shoulder against the man’s chest.</p><p>“Do you wear red often?” Taiga asked, taking the oolong chu from his hand.</p><p>The man shook his head.</p><p>“No. Just tonight.”</p><p>Taiga smoothed his hand down his chest, making sure his pinky caught on the chain of his necklace, making the man blush before he leaned in to speak into his ear.</p><p>He smiled as he saw the reddening of the man’s skin and felt his hand settle on his hip.</p><p>“Wear it again next time and I might have to take you home.”</p><p>With that, Taiga brushed away his hand and pushed him from himself by his chest.</p><p>He smiled at him as he pushed the oolong chu in front of Yugo.</p><p>“Next time.”</p><p>If Yugo had been just a bit more sober, he would have felt guilty about the drinks Taiga harvested from unsuspecting men, but the way they oggled him and felt they had the right to his body because of a few sweet words made all the guilt melt away as he took a sip of his new drink.</p><p>The pleasant smile Taiga wore was gone by the time he turned back to him, leaning into the table and tugging at the bottom of the glass Yugo held.</p><p>“Let me have some.”</p><p>Yugo just laughed, his hand still on the cup as Taiga gripped it to lead it to his own lips.</p><p>“Have as much as you want. You earned it.”</p><p>Taiga’s nose scrunched a bit as he chuckled through his breath, getting a nip of the oolong chu before passing it back and washing it down with his own beer.</p><p>“It's nothing. Men in places like this are simple minded. They all come for the same thing so as long as you bait them with what they want, they reel in easy.”</p><p>“Was I simple minded that night too?”</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>As he lowered his glass, he caught Yugo’s smile as he rested his chin in his palm.</p><p>Taiga had never noticed how sexy the defined lines in Yugo’s arm and wrist were, especially when decorated with the silver bangle that always hung from it.</p><p>Maybe it was the alcohol.</p><p>But Taiga didn't care.</p><p>He smirked into his drink.</p><p>“Are you flirting with me, Kochi Yugo?” he asked jokingly as he took another swig of his drink.</p><p>Perhaps half mindedly swirling it in his mouth before he swallowed.</p><p>Yugo leaned back, setting his shoulder against the velvet cushioned wall with his glass still in his hand. “Depends on how you want to interpret it, Kyomoto Taiga. Do you think I'm flirting with you?”</p><p>“You'll make Jesse cry, you know.”</p><p>“Jesse understands.”</p><p>“Does he? The boy knows how to get jealous. Trust me, I know.”</p><p>“And you can trust that <em> I </em>know, thanks to you.”</p><p>Yugo’s smile always had a sweet charm. It lightened the air and calmed the hearts around it.</p><p>It was cute.</p><p>But they way it mismatched with his words stirred something in Taiga’s stomach as he continued.</p><p>“Sometimes I enjoy it when he's just a little jealous.”</p><p>Taiga scoffed. He joined him by the wall, resting his weight against it.</p><p>“Oh yeah? Does he get forceful?”</p><p>“A little. But Jesse treats me right. He knows what I like.”</p><p>Taiga had to resist rolling his eyes as he set the rim of his glass against his lip. “Alright, well don't brag about it. I don't need all the details.”</p><p>Yugo laughed as he set down his cup. “Well. At least let me tell you one more thing.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Jesse really complimented my kissing that night.”</p><p>Was it just the blurring of his vision or had Yugo always been this close?</p><p>Taiga could almost feel the heat radiating off his skin as their arms were close to touching when Yugo moved near.</p><p>And perhaps Taiga encouraged their arms to bump as he shifted his feet.</p><p>“Oh? Why's that?”</p><p>Taiga knew why.</p><p>He just wanted to hear it from Yugo’s lips.</p><p>After all, no one hated getting compliments, especially when it came to how well they used their tongue.</p><p>“I learned from the best,” Yugo said.</p><p>“And you learn quick,” Taiga replied.</p><p>Taiga chuckled through his nose as he placed down his cup on the small bar table, his eyes not moving away from the hues that caught in Yugo’s heavy lashes.</p><p>“Are you asking for another lesson, Yugo?”</p><p>The hand Yugo slid onto his hip felt like fire as it smoothly slid along the waistband of his slacks.</p><p>It had been a long time since Taiga had the heat of someone else's touch like this.</p><p>Even without drowning himself in work, it felt like a waste of energy when the caress didn't belong to Hokuto.</p><p>If the warmth didn't belong to Hokuto.</p><p>If the kiss didn't belong to Hokuto.</p><p>Taiga didn't want to smother the lingering sensation of what Hokuto left on his lips with someone he wouldn't bother even learning the name of.</p><p>But that didn't mean a hunger didn't stir in Taiga’s stomach.</p><p>For a person who once devoured men on a timely and regular basis, suddenly going cold turkey didn't do great things for his appetite.</p><p>He was able to suppress it by keeping himself busy with work and tiring himself down to nothing, along with the aid of occasional self pleasure with Hokuto’s name on his lips, but just a touch like this was enough to rattle the cage he fought so hard to keep shut.</p><p>The alcohol was no help either.</p><p>Taiga let Yugo easily swivel his hip to set his back flat against the deep colored wall as his heels knocked against the baseboards.</p><p>Yugo had always been a bit taller and usually Taiga didn't pay any mind to it.</p><p>But when staring at Yugo’s lowered eyes through the edge of his bangs that hung over them, it was hard not to notice.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“That's okay, isn't it?”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Yugo used the same words against him just as Taiga had done to him before.</p><p>Taiga wanted to praise himself, because they worked well.</p><p>For the moment that he was speechless for an answer, Yugo leaned in, pressing their lips together.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>It felt so good.</p><p>The hunger boiling inside Taiga didn't let them start slow even if he had wanted to.</p><p>The moment Yugo parted to wet his lips, Taiga’s tongue flicked out, eager for more of his heat.</p><p>People made out in the club all the time and Taiga was no exception. He had stolen his fair share of lips, whether it had been in the hallway, the bathroom, or even at the center of the dance floor.</p><p>He felt no shame as Yugo drew out long rolling kisses and bumps of their lips.</p><p>If someone wanted to watch, then let them watch.</p><p>It was certainly quite the show, after all.</p><p>Taiga drew his hand up along Yugo’s chest, letting his fingers get tangled in the silver feather necklace he wore so often as he caught Yugo’s plump bottom lip between his teeth. Just the feeling of Yugo dragging his fingers up his body over his silk shirt was almost enough to make Taiga groan in his throat.</p><p>More.</p><p>He wanted more.</p><p>Yugo only pressed against him closer when Taiga pulled at the front of his belt, making their legs thread together. He smiled as their noses bumped, seeing the unfocused haze in Taiga’s eyes before they closed again and hurriedly brought their lips back together, causing their teeth to clash.</p><p>As Yugo went to kiss and suck at the skin under Taiga’s jaw, Taiga let out a gasp nearly loud enough to be heard in the low pitches of the booming music, making Yugo laugh and press his fingers into the soft points of Taiga’s waist to straighten out his mind.</p><p>“Careful,” Yugo whispered into his ear as Taiga couldn't keep himself from laughing with him.</p><p>Taiga just hummed, running his fingers through the back of his hair to encourage his lips back to his neck.</p><p>“It's fine,” he breathed.</p><p>“It's not like I'm saving them for anyone's ears anyways.”</p><p>He closed his eyes and shut out the flashing lights, letting himself get lost in the feeling of Yugo’s tongue on his neck as his nails scratched gently over his scalp. Soft pants left his lips as Yugo sucked and kissed at his smooth throat, only stopping just short of leaving any bruises.</p><p>Once Yugo pulled away, Taiga took his chin to bring him back to his lips.</p><p>Yugo’s leg pushed further between his, further tangling themselves together as Taiga dragged his heel up along his calf while they exchanged breaths. He shuddered as Yugo slipped his fingers into the belt loops of his slacks, pressing his hips tighter against the wall while Taiga’s hands pushed under the collar of Yugo’s shirt, following the smooth curves of his shoulder and neck.</p><p>Taiga could taste the flavor of the shochu they shared on his tongue.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p>Maybe this was exactly what he needed.</p><p>Just a moment to finally let go.</p><p>With the alcohol and the rhythmic rocks of Yugo’s lips against his, he could leave it all behind.</p><p>So what if Hokuto’s one kiss burned deeper than any other?</p><p>So what if Taiga wished those few seconds after could have lasted hours to let Hokuto’s gaze be ingrained into his eyes?</p><p>So what?</p><p>He would never see him again.</p><p>Never hear his soft low voice again.</p><p>Never see that cute blush or bashful wavering of his eyes ever again.</p><p>It was fine.</p><p>Taiga sighed as Yugo’s touch pulled away only for a second, not leaving time for his eyes to open before hands caught his jaw and raised his chin.</p><p>It was fine.</p><p>He gripped his hands into his sleeves as lips pressed into his again.</p><p>This was fine.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He could forget Hokuto’s kiss.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The kiss prolonged.</p><p>It stayed steady and firm until Taiga’s lips were finally softly released.</p><p>The music that had been muted in his ears came flooding back as their heated kiss paused, bringing his eyes to flutter.</p><p>Before they snapped wide open.</p><p>Taiga struggled for words.</p><p>“Wh—...”</p><p>The hands fell from his cheeks.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“M-... Matsumura?...”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>In the dim lights and the haze of his drinks, Taiga wasn't sure if he had really seen the crease between his brows before his eyes turned away before his whole body turned to thread back out through the scattered crowd.</p><p>Taiga was left speechless.</p><p>He was so caught up in the sensation and his thoughts didn't even notice that the fabric between his fingers was no longer soft silk but the stiff cotton of a suit.</p><p>He didn't even notice how his chin was lifted to match the taller height.</p><p>Taiga just exhaled, fixing his ruffled hair, not knowing what else to do.</p><p>What just happened?</p><p>Did it really happen?</p><p>Was it a delusion?</p><p>A dream?</p><p>His eyes caught on Yugo’s who appeared much more calm than he was, standing back a bit further than Taiga would have expected for someone he had or hadn't just been kissing.</p><p>“K-Kochi, what just—”</p><p>“Are you not going to chase him?”</p><p>Taiga blinked as Yugo smiled.</p><p>He barely had a chance to fix his clothes before Yugo was pushing at his back. “B-but I don't understand— What did- Why–”</p><p>Yugo just laughed, shoving him one last time.</p><p>“Why don't you go find out?”</p><p>Taiga didn't know what he was doing.</p><p>Taiga was someone who always wanted to know exactly what he was doing and where he was going, but for once, he had no clue.</p><p>His feet quickened as he passed through the other patrons of the club, getting complaints that he ignored before he made it out the door.</p><p>There were too few but also too many people out on the street for him to immediately spot him, but he found who he was looking for.</p><p>“Matsumura!!”</p><p>Hokuto turned around when his voice was called, but quickly looked away when he saw who came towards him. He tried to keep walking, but was stopped in his tracks when Taiga grabbed at his sleeve.</p><p>Taiga caught his breath, his head almost spinning as he swallowed hard to steady himself and his chest before speaking again.</p><p>“What—,” he panted. “What are you doing here–??”</p><p>Hokuto didn't answer, nor did he look at him.</p><p>His hand just tightened on his briefcase as he rubbed the palm of his hand over his mouth.</p><p>“Matsumura?” Taiga repeated.</p><p>The silence became uncomfortable before Taiga tried to fill it.</p><p>“You-... You don't know what kind of place this is. You shouldn't be here.”</p><p>Taiga let go of his sleeve. “This isn't a place for someone like you. Just–… Just quickly go home and–”</p><p>“I was looking for you.”</p><p>Taiga looked up from the pavement to see Hokuto turn to him, but not his eyes.</p><p>“I-... Today is the last day, right?... Of our contract.”</p><p>Yes. It was.</p><p>Taiga expected to never see him again.</p><p>He wasn't sure if he wanted to see him again.</p><p>“I noticed you were staying late at the office a while ago. I wanted to say something but I–... Since I didn't know if I’d see you again I wanted to bring you something, but you were already gone.”</p><p>Taiga hadn't noticed the small convenience store bag Hokuto held with his briefcase.</p><p>Even through the frosted plastic, he saw the lone can of sweet cafe au latte within it.</p><p>“I thought Kochi might know where you were, so I came.”</p><p>“I…” Hokuto hesitated.</p><p>“I just wanted to see you one last time.”</p><p>Taiga huffed out a laugh because he didn't know what else to do.</p><p>He felt like he was getting caught up in a storm in his mind. He didn't understand what Hokuto was saying. He didn't understand because he had convinced himself so deeply that it couldn't be anything more than a kindness that was only skin-deep.</p><p>“Well… You’ve seen me,” Taiga said, matter of factly as he spread out his arms, presenting himself. “You shouldn't go doing things without considering what people will think it means. Your girlfriend will get upset, you know.”</p><p>“Or… Perhaps you're trying to make her jealous?”</p><p>That made sense. It was just the same as Yugo and Jesse. A spark of jealousy to light up a relationship.</p><p>Taiga kept talking only because Hokuto stayed silent.</p><p>“It won't work if she doesn't see it. Also with someone like me—... I know I'm easy but you should find a different girl. You should—”</p><p>“I don't have a girlfriend.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Taiga watched as Hokuto’s lips twisted before he rubbed the back of his hand over his nose.</p><p>It was something he often did when he got embarrassed, Taiga started to notice.</p><p>“Then… Then why—”</p><p>Hokuto started to walk away again.</p><p>“Hey-!!”</p><p>Taiga caught his sleeve again, forcing him to stop.</p><p>This time, Taiga didn't let go.</p><p>He swallowed hard.</p><p>Life wasn't a fairytale.</p><p>Life was relentless and grimy as the city street they stood upon.</p><p>The last thing he wanted to do was to believe in a fantasy again, only to be hurt.</p><p>But he had to know.</p><p>If only for the sake of finally being able to let it all go.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Taiga saw him cover his eyes even when only watching his back. He could see Hokuto’s dark hair shift as he pushed up the glasses on his nose.</p><p>“I–...”</p><p>Hokuto’s voice sounded like he could cry.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I don't like seeing you kiss other men.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga felt like he forgot how to breathe.</p><p>His grip fell from Hokuto’s arm as he turned, their eyes finally meeting for a moment before Hokuto’s jolted away again.</p><p>From the first moment Hokuto saw him, Hokuto thought his heart would explode.</p><p>Without his glasses, he only saw the blurred lines of a man, but once they came into focus, they made up the image of someone with porcelain skin and blonde hair that seemed to glow.</p><p>Now that he saw the gentle shape of his eyes and the curve of his lips, Hokuto understood why his touch felt like fire on his skin.</p><p>There was a fire in his chest too.</p><p>Things like love at first sight were saved for children’s novels and story books that were filled with magic and a perfect romance, and Hokuto didn't doubt that still held true.</p><p>Maybe awe at first sight or stunned at first sight were better words for it.</p><p>The love came later.</p><p>Taiga's work and his words were as perfect as his looks and his kindness and his patience with him was as sweet as his smile.</p><p>Hokuto couldn't help but be enamored.</p><p>He also couldn't help but look away every time he caught Taiga’s gaze or he thought his heart might burst.</p><p>When he woke up that night and saw Taiga’s lips locked with Yugo’s, he wasn't sure what he felt first, the skip of his heart watching Taiga’s swollen lips or the stir in his stomach that made him feel sick seeing Taiga take Yugo’s taste from his tongue.</p><p>Hokuto was the last person to act on his impulses. If anything, Yugo had told him to have more confidence in his own actions and to just trust that things would be alright rather than doubting and double checking time and time again.</p><p>But the alcohol had dampened his hesitation and the want to be Taiga’s last taste at the end of that night had pushed him in a way he never knew was possible.</p><p>He wished he could have kissed him again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>But the shudder on his skin sobered him enough to pull back his senses and run before he did something stupid again.</p><p>He was in too deep.</p><p>He knew he was in too deep when his ex’s kiss felt like nothing when she tried to tempt him back.</p><p>She reminded him of Taiga.</p><p>Sharp tongued and beautiful with a gaze anyone could sink into.</p><p>Yet somehow, all Hokuto could think about was how he regretted losing Taiga as his last kiss.</p><p>Hokuto knew he was a coward and his fears only grew as he crossed Taiga’s path less. Caught his eyes less. Heard his voice less.</p><p>Perhaps Taiga regretted that night.</p><p>Maybe a deep kiss shared with someone strong and independent like Yugo was a better flavor than someone so simple and tasteless as him.</p><p>Still, he wanted to see him just one last time.</p><p>He would be brave, just one more time.</p><p>And when he saw Yugo and Taiga kissing under the dimmed lights of the club, all of it burned up in flames.</p><p>Jealousy was like lighter fluid in a fire.</p><p>His emotions burned bright as he pulled at Yugo’s shoulder.</p><p>The heat rose in his throat as took the lips that didn't belong to him, but wanted to believe that every second that they were pressed against his own that they were.</p><p>And when they parted, and Hokuto saw his eyes meet his for the first time in weeks, it all went out in smoke.</p><p>Life wasn't a fairytale.</p><p>There were no princes. No princesses. No bed of flowers. No curse.</p><p>Only hearts to bear in the dark streets of the city that were illuminated with neon lights.</p><p>“Matsumura.”</p><p>Hokuto couldn't look at him. A shame was sinking deep in his chest as Taiga’s gentle voice reached him.</p><p>“Do you want to kiss me?”</p><p>Hokuto didn't move his hand from his face as he spoke.</p><p>“I do…”</p><p>His hand fell away only once Taiga pulled his arm.</p><p>Hokuto was handsome.</p><p>Very handsome.</p><p>Every bit of shyness in his expression made it that much more charming.</p><p>He was cute too. And sweet. And lovely.</p><p>Perhaps not a knight in shining armor.</p><p>But still, the man Taiga wanted to be in love with.</p><p>The one to take him from his loneliness.</p><p>To wake him in the mornings and to tell him goodnight.</p><p>To love him.</p><p>“I want you to kiss me too.”</p><p>Hokuto hesitated.</p><p>He always did.</p><p>But at least Taiga was there to meet him halfway.</p><p>It was a moment that felt like it could have lasted forever.</p><p>It wasn't their first kiss and it wasn't even their second.</p><p>But the third time’s a charm.</p><p>If there was ever a curse to be broken, it was surely shattered now.</p><p>Hokuto’s grip pressed creases into the sleeves on Taiga's upper arms as Taiga sighed into their kiss, their lips fitting perfectly together while Taiga held tightly to the collar of Hokuto’s suit.</p><p>Taiga didn't care who stared as they walked by.</p><p>The whole world could watch for all he cared.</p><p>When they parted, Taiga laughed and Hokuto panicked.</p><p>“K-Kyomoto? Why are you laughing–?” Hokuto asked, still holding Taiga close as Taiga bumped his forehead against his.</p><p>“Do you prefer kissing Kochi more or am I—”</p><p>“No-,” Taiga chuckled as he smiled, feeling how naturally Hokuto’s arms seemed to fold around him when he leaned into him.</p><p>“Not at all.”</p><p>The chill of the cool evening air was nothing when wrapped in Hokuto’s arms. Even in just his thin clothing, Taiga was warm in his embrace that seemed to clutch around him with a possessiveness that was as obvious as it was unintentional.</p><p>Taiga just let himself be bound by it as his heart was woken by a gentle love for the first and what he hoped would be the last time.</p><p>“I just thought that if reality is like this–”</p><p>“Then I have no need for fairytales.”</p><p>When Taiga pulled back to meet Hokuto’s gaze, he saw how Hokuto’s eyes jolted away, but as he cupped his cheek, they slowly eased back, finally meeting with his again.</p><p>“Hey,” Taiga spoke softly.</p><p>“Do you want to kiss me again?...”</p><p>Hokuto nodded, almost obediently.</p><p>“I do…”</p><p>Taiga took his glasses from his nose and folded them in his hand.</p><p>Hokuto was already starting to lean in as Taiga looped his arms around his neck.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I want you to kiss me again too.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Jesse could immediately smell the alcohol on Yugo's breath when he opened the door to welcome him in.</p><p>“You're early–”</p><p>He held out his hand to help take Yugo’s bag as he slipped off his shoes.</p><p>“Is that a problem?”</p><p>“No, not really-”</p><p>Yugo had arrived earlier than Jesse had expected, in the case that Yugo was going to arrive at all. He had assumed he would either show up in the late hours of the evening or return straight home.</p><p>But to say that he wasn't pleasantly surprised would be a lie. Especially when Yugo stumbled into his arms to pull him in for a kiss.</p><p>Jesse staggered but caught himself as Yugo crushed their lips together, quickly smudging the balm Jesse had applied just moments ago in favor of the taste of alcohol that still lingered on Yugo’s tongue.</p><p>He held him by the waist, Yugo raking his nails through Jesse’s clean fade while he took smooth rolling kisses from his lips.</p><p>“Hey, Jesse,” Yugo whispered between the break of their kiss as Jesse hummed.</p><p>“I kissed Taiga again.”</p><p>Jesse blinked as Yugo pulled him in closer.</p><p>“Huh–??”</p><p>He tried to speak, but Yugo refused to let him go, continuing to claim his lips even as he struggled to get out his voice.</p><p>“You—” Jesse huffed through his nose as Yugo severed his sentences. “You kissed— mn- Taiga— again–???”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>Jesse wanted to be upset and push Yugo off, but he couldn't deny that he liked the feel of Yugo’s lips and each kiss felt good.</p><p>So his eyebrows just pinched as he pulled them both inside, dropping Yugo and himself onto his bed they had already shared many times.</p><p>Yugo chuckled into his lips when he felt Jesse begin to undo the buttons of his silken top before he took the liberty of also tugging up the back of Jesse's clothes. “Are you jealous?”</p><p>“It was just a kiss–” Yugo added.</p><p>Jesse sat back only for a moment to pull off his own shirt before quickly removing Yugo of his own.</p><p>“Was it really just a kiss?”</p><p>Yugo smiled, sighing out a long breath as he loved the way Jesse’s large hands felt dragging up his bare skin.</p><p>“Just a kiss.”</p><p>“Maybe also a nip. And a suck.”</p><p>Jesse frowned as he ran his hands under Yugo’s slender arms before pinning them down against the bed by his forearms.</p><p>“You're just trying to rile me up.”</p><p>“No, I'm not. All I'm doing is telling the truth.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes lowered, followed Jesse’s lips as Jesse leaned over him, letting Yugo just barely brush them together.</p><p>His breath was hot over his skin as he whispered against them.</p><p>“It was only a kiss.”</p><p>“Just one. Long. Hot. Heavy kiss to make the most reserved of men jealous.”</p><p>Jesse didn't ask any more questions after that.</p><p>He didn't want to understand anymore of it as he made sure Yugo’s voice was hoarse the next morning.</p><p>It didn't matter as he was able to tie together the loose ends the next work day when Taiga seemed lighter on his feet with a cafe au latte on his desk and a jacket that didn't belong to him on his shoulders.</p><p>“Do I need to ask?” Jesse said as he pulled out his chair to sit down across from him.</p><p>“Depends on how much you want to know,” Taiga chimed back.</p><p>Jesse sighed before sitting down.</p><p>“What did you do with my boyfriend?”</p><p>“You should be asking what your boyfriend did to <em> me </em>.”</p><p>“Does it matter?”</p><p>“It matters a lot, actually.”</p><p>“Just stop making out with my boyfriend, okay?”</p><p>Taiga laughed, tugging the coat that still had Hokuto’s scent locked in its fabric back over him.</p><p>“Oh, don't fuss over it Jesse.”</p><p>“It was only a kiss.”</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Wah.</p><p>I know the alternate ending of With You won the poll but tbh, that story needs a lot more work than I had initially thought. I had written so much of a long time ago but looking back at it, there's a lot I want to change. I keep struggling with it and I wanted to at least post something... So its not quite the Christmas present I wanted to give, but I promise it will be the next thing that comes out! But for now, please enjoy some more of kyomoyugo kissing haha!!</p><p>I don't really have much else to say! I'm... writing... sometimes. There's projects I want to work on, but every time I start, I get stuck. I can only hope that eventually the flow hits me enough to finish it. Hopefully it won't be too long, but I can't say anything for sure. I started writing a smut fic in this setting, but we'll see if I can ever get myself to finish it haha its kyomohoku aaa.</p><p>Anyways, I would love to hear what you think!! It ended up skewing more kyomohoku in the end, but truly, I can't stop myself. Every comment encourages me on my way! I happily take constructive critisism too~</p><p>I have a twitter that I use to mostly post pictures of Taiga and kyomohoku things!!! I also post my fic updates there when I do have a new fic! I also talk about stuff from time to time, but that's the boring stuff, isn't it?<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it!!!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I have nothing to defend myself with haha!!</p><p>I've fallen victim to how cute kyomoyugo has been lately. They've been rather adorable together recently, haven't they?? Their dynamic has been so cute... but I feel like this is far as my ship goes hehe.</p><p>I like having them kiss, but in a way that's kind of just a mutual understanding of enjoying the feeling of it, if that makes sense. They're my "yuri pair" if its okay to call it that haha!!! I hope the people that said they'd be angry will forgive me. In truth, this kyomoyugo is just yugoje and kyomohoku in disguise.</p><p>The beginning of the fic is a little messy.... To explain, this whole plot idea was actually crafted for something else, but I reworked it to make it into a one-shot. That's why there's so much world building at the beginning but I hope it didn't feel like a slog to get through. Its just all in fun... I hope people had fun.......</p><p>Well this isn't what I expected to have as one of my rare posts, but I hope its enjoyable. I do have a lot of works still floating around and I am determined to get more than this fic out the door, but as I write, my head gets all caught up in the details and I don't like how it turns out. I'll keep doing my best regardless. I have some ideas I really like!!! It's just about finally getting them finished...</p><p>Anyways, I won't ramble anymore. If you would like to leave a comment, please do! I really enjoy hearing what people have to say and it gives a little boost to keep writing! I promise I'll come back with kyomohoku eventually... I swear... Please don't be mad...</p><p>I have a twitter! I'm trying to use it more, but I'm really not using it much! I post fic updates and usually complain about whatever progress I'm not making haha... But if you want to talk, my dms are open and I'm always happy to talk!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it and tell me how much you dislike me haha juuuust kidding~<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p><p>Thanks so much for reading!</p></blockquote>
