    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Hokuto doesn’t know why he thought this was a good idea.</p><p>The night started great. He and his friends had been planning on clubbing for a while now, ever since they had found out Hokuto had never been clubbing before.</p><p>“I never thought about going clubbing, I guess,” he said, after his friends' constant questions and teasing.</p><p>“Well, we just have to take you out, then!” One said, patting him on his back.</p><p>They planned on taking Hokuto to a club his friends frequented, and because he trusts his friends, he agreed. But at the last minute, each one of them started cancelling on him, coming up with some bullshit excuse.</p><p>In a blind rage, he went to the club alone. He wasn’t going to waste a perfectly good Friday night. Damn his friends, he’s going to the club alone.</p><p>That’s how he ended up here, drunk and on his 5th beer, in the corner of the club.</p><p>He never should’ve agreed to go clubbing in the first place, he thinks. The music was too loud, people were all over each other, and it was hot and sweaty and gross. Hokuto pulled out his phone to call for an Uber when a man so beautiful started approaching him.</p><p>“Are you okay? What’s wrong? Did you come alone?” the man said, yelling to be heard over the loud music.</p><p>Hokuto was at a loss. He takes a sip of his beer, “ah, yes,” he mutters. He’s a little drunker than he thought.</p><p>The man leaned in suddenly, “Do you wanna have a drink with me over there?” he says, hot breath tickling Hokuto’s neck.</p><p>The man gestures to what looks like a VIP area of the club. Secluded and closed off from the crowd, something Hokuto desperately needed.</p><p>Before he even replies, the man grabs his wrist and pulls him to the section.</p><p>“Walk slowly, be careful. It’s quieter there, safer too.”</p><p>The VIP section had about 5 people in total that cheered when they entered. The man ordered champagne for the table and the cheers only got louder.</p><p>“Taiga’s the fucking best,” one of the guys said, clapping and cheering his friend.</p><p>Taiga. That’s his name.</p><p>Taiga gives him a glass of…something, and he willingly takes it.</p><p>“What’s a pretty boy doing in a place like this, hm?” Taiga asks, looking at him.</p><p>Hokuto drinks the mystery drink and he winces. The drink was some kind of mojito but it was 90% rum and 10% soda water.</p><p>“My friends ditched me, they were supposed to come with me,” he answers honestly. He gulps the mojito, making him drunker than he already was.</p><p>“Fuck them, then. You’re here with me now,” Taiga chugs his drink and stands, “Dance with me?”</p><p>He reaches for Hokuto’s hand and Hokuto follows. He’s usually not this obedient, he doesn’t know why he’s doing whatever this man asked him to do. Maybe because he was drunk and this man looks like an angel sent by God, he’s not completely sure.</p><p>Hokuto starts dancing, but Taiga then puts his hands on Hokuto’s waist.</p><p>“Like this. Shake your hips like this,” he sways them side to side, pulling Hokuto closer.</p><p>Hokuto puts his hands on Taiga’s shoulder and grinds.</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>He was so close he could smell the other man’s cologne.</p><p>“Yes. Like that.”</p><p>“Are you free later?” Hokuto whispers, feeling brave.</p><p>Taiga laughs, “yeah. Wanna go somewhere?”</p><p>“Where?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>“Anywhere. I’ll go anywhere with you.”</p><p>-</p><p>The night started great, then terrible, then amazing, Hokuto thinks as he tugs off Taiga’s shirt.</p><p>He kisses the other man like it was the last thing he was ever going to do. Hokuto could taste the alcohol in Taiga’s mouth, making him dizzy.</p><p>“I don’t think I asked for your name,” Taiga says as Hokuto trails wet kisses down his neck.</p><p>“Hokuto,” he says, lightly nipping on his collarbone.</p><p>“<i>Hokuto,</i>” Taiga moans. “Pretty name for a pretty boy,”</p><p>Hokuto picks Taiga up and throws him on the bed, then kisses him again. He kisses down, down, reaching his chest. Hokuto takes one nipple in his mouth and the other with his finger, flicking and fondling.</p><p>Taiga squirms underneath him, moaning a string of swear words and Hokuto’s name. Cute.</p><p>“Please,<i> please,</i>” Taiga pleads.</p><p>“Hm? Please what?” Hokuto teases.</p><p>“Fuck me.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, “Since you asked so nicely,” He bites down on the other man’s chest one last time, before opening the bedside drawer.</p><p>Hokuto thanks the heavens above when he finds what he’s looking for, along with other things.</p><p>Hokuto takes the condom and lube, and holds up pink fluffy handcuffs, “wanna try them out?” He jokes.</p><p>Taiga takes them from him and throws them on the floor, “next time.”</p><p>Hokuto quickly takes off his clothes and Taiga’s underwear. Taiga looks even prettier naked, Hokuto almost couldn’t believe this was happening to him.</p><p>Hokuto coats his hands in lube and positions a finger, but Taiga stops him.</p><p>“I don’t need that, just do it,” Taiga says, eyes pleading.</p><p>Hokuto may be drunk, but he’s not cruel, “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Taiga takes the condom and rips it open with his mouth, then rolls it on Hokuto.</p><p>“I need you <i>now.</i>”</p><p>That was enough to convince Hokuto. He lines himself up and thrusts slowly, so painfully slow.</p><p>Taiga was so warm, so warm and tight. Hokuto continues until he’s fully enveloped in Taiga’s warmth.</p><p>“<i>Taiga,</i> fuck.”</p><p>The other man giggles breathlessly, he thinks this is funny. Hokuto is smitten.</p><p>“Move,” Taiga commands, pushing himself into Hokuto more, making both of them moan.</p><p>“Patience,” Hokuto says as he lays on top of Taiga, “you are so hot.”</p><p>“In what sense, exactly?” Taiga smiles. Does he ever shut up?</p><p>Hokuto thrusts into Taiga catching him off-guard. Taiga squeaks.</p><p>“That shut you up, huh?” Hokuto smiles as he kisses him.</p><p>Hokuto started with slow, languid thrusts, making Taiga lose his mind.</p><p>“You okay?” Hokuto asks.</p><p>“Yes, yeah. Just please, go faster. You won’t hurt me. Please.” Taiga begs, tears threatening to fall from the overstimulation.</p><p>Hokuto sits up and grabs Taiga’s waist, “you asked for this.” He warns.</p><p>He does what he’s told, fucking Taiga faster and harder. Taiga moans Hokuto’s name over and over, telling him how he’s so good. He repeats Hokuto’s name like a prayer, making Hokuto fuck Taiga harder.</p><p>“Close,” Taiga says in between moans.</p><p>Hokuto caresses Taiga’s face softly, the first kind touch he’s received all night.</p><p>Yet he continues to thrust harder and harder, finally pushing Taiga off the edge. He arches his back and shuts his eyes hard, Hokuto soon follows.</p><p>Hokuto falls on the bed next to Taiga when he notices the other has fallen asleep. Taiga’s breathing was even. <i>Ah, he’s one of those types,</i> Hokuto thinks.</p><p>He makes quick work of cleaning himself, exhaustion suddenly hitting him. He spends a few more minutes willing himself to stay awake to watch Taiga sleep because he doesn’t know when he’ll get the chance again, but soon sleep overpowers him.</p><p>-</p><p>Hokuto wakes up the next morning, sunlight directly shining on his face. His head was throbbing in pain and his body felt heavy, but he remembers everything that happened the night before. Hokuto does not regret a single thing.</p><p>He sits up and looks for his phone. 15 missed calls and unread texts from his “friends.”</p><p>The person next to him stirs awake and groans.</p><p>“Morning,” Hokuto says, tracing Taiga’s face with his fingertips.</p><p>Taiga smiles as soon as he feels Hokuto’s touch, “morning already?”</p><p>Hokuto chuckles. He kisses Taiga, taking his time this time. It was already infinitely better than their hurried kisses from last night.</p><p>“When can we do this again?” Taiga asks as soon as Hokuto pulls away.</p><p>“Take me out on a date first, at least.” Hokuto teases, pinching Taiga’s cheek.</p><p>“Fine. Hokuto-kun, will you go on a date with me?”</p><p>Hokuto laughs, full and bright. “Thought you’d never ask.”</p>
