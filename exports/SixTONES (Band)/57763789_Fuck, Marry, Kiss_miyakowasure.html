<h2 class="toc-heading">Fuck, Marry, Kiss</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Kamenashi,” Jesse announced just as Taiga entered the dressing room. Jesse hadn’t even started to undress yet, but was still wearing his blue track pants and t-shirt.</p><p>Next to Jesse, Juri hummed in agreement, pulled off his own shirt and folded it on the table. “Nice! His ass isn’t the greatest, but his face is nice!”</p><p>“He’s cool and kind, and he has an <i>excellent</i> face,” Jesse said firmly.</p><p>Avoiding the two altogether, Taiga tiptoed over to where Kochi had just put his own track jacket on a hanger.</p><p>“What’s that about?” he asked in a low voice.</p><p>Kochi snorted. “They’re playing <i>fuck, marry, kill</i> but they didn’t want to kill anyone even in theory, so it’s actually <i>fuck, marry, kiss</i>, and the options are limited to other Starto idols.”</p><p>“And you don’t mind at all because Jesse said he’d marry you!” Shintaro snickered and ruffled Kochi’s hair as he passed them on his way to the showers, only wearing a white towel around his waist.</p><p>“Who’d Juri like to marry?” Taiga asked, mildly curious, as he started to take off his own clothes.</p><p>“Me,” Hokuto chuckled, already back from his quicker-than-quick shower. Having got his pants and shirt on, he picked up a clean towel from a side table and started to dry his hair. “Because I can cook and sew, and because he’s just <i>used to</i> sleeping next to me after all the years of sharing hotel rooms. The hero of romance, that one.”</p><p>“Stop complaining,” Juri hollered from his and Jesse’s corner, grinning at Hokuto. “You know I’d be a great life partner! I’m tidy and low maintenance.”</p><p>“Low maintenance my ass.”</p><p>“Juri would kiss Raul, because apparently last time he was out drinking with Shoppi and Raul, Raul told them he’s never kissed a guy before. And Jesse would kiss Nakayama Yuma, because <i>he looks like a good kisser</i>,” Kochi continued.</p><p>"Even though I told him Yuma really isn't," Hokuto pointed out.</p><p>"Speaking out of experience?" Taiga chuckled, not expecting Hokuto and Kochi to share a wry smile.</p><p>"Long story short,” Hokuto said, “we were curious, inexperienced teens. Fuma swore that kissing would feel completely different with different people, so of course the five of us had to try all the different combinations between us to see if he was right."</p><p>"The five-" Taiga said slowly as he dropped his track suit onto the sofa in the middle of the room. "Kochi! You, too?"</p><p>Kochi made a face. "For the record, Hokuto and Kento were okay. Fuma was a bit too eager but not unpleasant. And Yuma..."</p><p>"Let's hope he's improved during the past ten years," Hokuto finished for him.</p><p>"That's mean," Kochi said, but his eyes were laughing like he only said that on principle.</p><p>Taiga pulled off his white t-shirt and dropped it in the same bundle with the track suit. “Hokuto? Throw me one of those towels? Thanks!” He caught the flying towel from the air, pulled off his boxers and wrapped himself into the soft white fabric.</p><p>“Kyomo,” Juri said thoughtfully, and Taiga glanced across his shoulder.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>But Juri wasn’t talking to him. He was pursing his lips and looking at Jesse, whose brows had risen up high.</p><p>“Good choice,” Jesse said, and Taiga suddenly realized what it was about.</p><p>“You’re on Fuma’s team then,” he said dryly, remembering the rather embarrassing radio interview in which Fuma had told Shori he wouldn't mind making out with Taiga because "Taiga looks like a girl anyway".</p><p>“I’m not!” Juri exclaimed, his eyes wide. “He was a bit of a jerk there, really. <i>I</i> don’t only want to fuck you because you look like a girl, because you <i>don’t</i>. I would like to fuck you because you’re freaking hot!”</p><p>Taiga raised an unimpressed brow, ruffling his hair and scalp with his fingertips and trying to judge whether he could still get away with it for one more night. The hair itself wasn’t too bad but his scalp felt itchy. Time to wash it, then.</p><p>“You agree, don’t you,” Juri appealed to Hokuto and Kochi, but the two, though laughing about it, firmly excluded themselves from the game by refusing to take a stance.</p><p>Shaking his head, Taiga decided to save his own sanity by escaping to the showers.</p><p>The air in the shower room was misty. There were two stalls, and the water splashing in Shintaro’s stall echoed from the tiled walls. Taiga hung his towel to a hook and pulled the shower curtain after himself. The floor was already wet so Hokuto must have used that stall before him, and Taiga was careful not to stand under the shower head when he turned the water on. Even though the water usually tended to be scalding hot rather than cold after Hokuto, being careful never hurt anyone. While Taiga didn’t mind an occasional cool shower or dip in a cold pool, he didn’t especially fancy doing so unprepared.</p><p>The water didn’t quite burn him, but he quickly reached to turn the handle towards the cooler temperature anyway before stepping under the shower and starting to wash himself.</p><p>He was rubbing conditioner on his hair when he heard Shintaro turning off the water. Shintaro’s steps made a small slapping sound while he dried himself and exited the shower stall. Someone must have been waiting their turn directly behind the door, because Shintaro made a surprised noise right after opening it.</p><p>“Sorry!” Juri’s cheerful voice echoed in the shower room, before the door was closed again. So now they were Juri’s bare feet that quietly padded around as he hung his towel next to Taiga’s, and opened and closed the shower curtain. The water started running again, and Taiga realized he had been rubbing the same thin strands of hair with his fingertips the whole time. He quickly scrunched the rest of his hair into his fists in order to spread the rest of the conditioner.</p><p>The click of a shampoo bottle opening and closing revealed that Juri was washing his hair, too. Wonder if he really followed his own silly hair-washing instructions. It was easy to imagine Juri turning his head down so he could apply the products into his hair in the perfect way only he himself understood. How he managed to do that without getting shampoo in his eyes, ears and nostrils was a mystery to everyone else.</p><p>On the other hand, Taiga kind of wanted to see if Juri’s weird hair care routine really worked. He currently had his hair dyed into a deep dark brown, but it wasn’t that long since the latest bleach and the ends of his hair felt a bit dry. He should cut his hair of course, to get rid of the ends, but before that he could try Juri’s routine to see if it would help at all.</p><p>A silly, intrusive idea of randomly stepping into Juri’s shower stall flashed in his head. He could try if Juri’s routine really made his hair as soft as he swore it did. Juri probably wouldn’t even mind.</p><p>Also, Juri just said, with everyone present, that he would like to fuck Taiga.</p><p>Huh. Not a bad idea, actually.</p><p>Taiga had never thought about Juri that way. Jokingly maybe, but not seriously, like he was actually planning to do something. But if he was perfectly honest with himself, the idea of having sex with Juri was…intriguing. Juri was so skilled at taking the lead and ordering the members around when it came to his job as their designated MC. Wonder how such confidence would translate into bedroom stuff?</p><p>For a moment Taiga entertained himself by imagining how it would feel to have Juri pressing him against the mattress and simply <i>taking</i> him. Taiga knew what he wanted in bed, but he sure wouldn’t mind letting Juri have his way with him. The mere thought made his stomach drop with arousal, and he chuckled at his own horny thoughts. Better stop now lest he’d have a hard problem at his hands. Literally.</p><p>The water stopped at Juri’s stall and Taiga swiftly continued washing himself. Jesse and Kochi were still queuing for the showers. Taiga also very firmly did <i>not</i> peek through the shower curtain when Juri quietly wrapped his towel around his waist and padded out of the shower room.</p><p>The last appointment of the day was a meeting with the managers, where they polished up some plans for the upcoming autumn. Taiga took part to the conversation of course, but more than once he simply stopped to observe Juri. As usual, Juri listened to everyone carefully and nodded at their ideas, even the extravagant ones that Jesse and Shintaro kept throwing around. Somehow Juri always managed to catch the main points even within the wildest suggestions, and brought them closer to realism while still keeping their spirit intact. Now that Taiga stopped to think about it, Juri was pretty admirable, professionally and otherwise.</p><p>He stifled a chuckle. Was he really so easy? Juri merely needed to not-quite-flirt with Taiga for kicks, and the next moment he seemed to be about the most interesting person in Taiga's world.</p><p>Whatever Juri-related fantasies Taiga had for the rest of the day, they would have stayed as such, if only Juri had left home a few minutes earlier. However, at the end of the evening the last two people picking up their bags in the dressing room were himself and Juri, and Taiga simply couldn't let the opportunity slide.</p><p>While Juri was fiddling with his earphones, Taiga silently moved behind him, standing as close to Juri as he could without actually touching him.</p><p>"Did you mean it?" he murmured into Juri's ear in a deliberately low voice. "Do you really want to fuck me?"</p><p>Startled, Juri gasped and bounced around to face Taiga. "Fuck, Taiga!" he whined indignantly before the meaning of Taiga's words sunk in. And whatever the answer would be, Juri's shocked expression of slowly dawning understanding already made Taiga’s question worthwhile.</p><p>"What, are you inviting me over?" Juri laughed, but his eyes were round and his his voice was delightfully incredulous.</p><p>Taiga raised a brow. "I'm inviting <i>me</i> over."</p><p>Juri could have refused. He could have said it really was just a joke for the silly game he played with Jesse. Instead, Juri nodded quickly and blurted out a hasty ‘yes’.</p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p>The drive to Juri’s home was a strange experience. Juri wasn't exactly quiet, but the usual relaxed banter wasn't there either. It could have been nervousness, but that didn't seem very likely. Juri was probably just tired. To fill the silence, Taiga chatted lightly about the new Yu-Gi-Oh collection cards he had recently bought. That way Juri only needed to hum and nod at him, without an obligation to actually say much.</p><p>"Are you hungry?" Juri asked as soon as they got to his place, and they made a mutual decision to order in food.</p><p>While waiting for the dinner to arrive, Juri put on a game of Mario Kart that ended up expanding into a whole tournament as the food arrived and they ate it. The game, the food, and the fun seemed to make Juri relax again which was great, but to Taiga's bafflement Juri didn't seem to be in any rush to initiating the kind of intimacy that Taiga had thought was the point of the visit.</p><p>When the next round of Mario Kart ended, Taiga put his game controller down to the floor.</p><p>"Are you ever gonna kiss me or something?" he asked.</p><p>For a moment Juri seemed to freeze. Then he slowly put down his own controller, inched closer to Taiga, and pressed their mouths together. Taiga closed his eyes and smiled against Juri's lips. <i>Finally.</i></p><p>The kiss was kind of sweet and hasty, almost chaste. Juri barely moved his lips, and when Taiga tried to deepen the kiss by leaning forward and lifting a hand to Juri's neck, Juri winced.</p><p>Taiga let him go immediately. Juri blinked quickly and only fleetingly met Taiga's eyes. He seemed tense and troubled, and he was squeezing the fabric of his sweatpants tightly, like he needed the feeble sense of control it offered.</p><p>Taiga frowned, trying to get a grasp on what was going on in Juri's head. Then something occurred to him.</p><p>"Do you even want to do this?" he asked, feeling simultaneously confused and worried. "You don't have to. It's okay to change your mind, surely you know that?"</p><p>Letting out a frustrated exhale, Juri made a face and shook his head. "It's not that," he said. For a moment he looked like he was going to elaborate, but then he gave up before any words came out.</p><p>Taiga didn't say anything, just raised his brows as if to say 'go on' and sat up straighter, giving Juri some physical space as well.</p><p>"I've never had sex with a guy," Juri finally admitted gingerly, like he had to actually force the words out. "Whatever I said at the dressing room probably sounded like I have, and I'd like to, but..." His words faded out and he scoffed. "Turns out I'm not quite as slutty as I like to pretend."</p><p>Taiga tried to stifle the laughter that suddenly escaped him, he truly did, but he failed, and rushed to speak before the hurt flashing in Juri's eyes had time to deepen.</p><p>"I know you're not slutty," Taiga agreed gently, even though he still felt like chuckling. "I wouldn't care of you were, but, honestly. I've seen your all-time played hours on Knives out. Between that and your work, when would you even have time to find the partners to be slutty with?"</p><p>Juri tilted his head to the side in a reluctant agreement.</p><p>"And I don't care if you've never had sex with a guy either," Taiga murmured, taking Juri's hand into his own and stroking his palm with his thumb. "The only thing I care about is whether you want to have sex with me or not."</p><p>An open expression of relief spread on Juri's face, and Taiga suddenly felt warm and pleased with himself for having managed to choose the right words.</p><p>"I want to!" Juri said. His voice was firm even though his expression was still somewhat shy, and Taiga's heart ached at the open trust and vulnerability Juri was letting him see. He pulled Juri into a tight hug.</p><p>"You don't have to know what to do. I'll tell you. Just keep talking to me, okay?"</p><p>Juri wrapped his arms around Taiga's waist and squeezed him back as easily as if they were at work in front of a dozen cameras. "Thank you," he murmured and leaned his head against Taiga’s shoulder.</p><p>"So," Taiga said slowly and turned his head so he could whisper directly into Juri's ear. "Wanna kiss me again?"</p><p>The sharp inhale he heard next made him smile, and he laid several kisses on Juri’s neck before he turned his face up towards Juri again and let Juri pull him into another kiss, much deeper than the one before. Taiga opened his mouth and let Juri in, his arms resting loosely on Juri’s shoulders. He moved his lips faster, pressed them against Juri’s more firmly, and sighed in pleasure when Juri moved on to kiss his neck. Eyes closed, Taiga let his head hang back and took deep, shivery breaths when Juri nibbled at the tender skin under his ear.</p><p>“Touch me,” Taiga asked in a low voice, leaning back and supporting himself with his hands. “Anywhere you like. You can go under my clothes, too.”</p><p>“To be honest, I’d rather do it that my bed,” Juri mused.</p><p>“Take me to bed, then.”</p><p>Walking into the dark room and falling on his back to Juri’s neatly made bed felt good and exciting, and even better when Juri followed to straddle him, his weight a delicious press on Taiga’s thighs and hips. Taiga wasn’t hard yet, but he would be soon, and there was no way Juri wouldn’t notice immediately when it happened.</p><p>“Can I take off your shirt?” Juri murmured, and when Taiga nodded, he pulled the loose, black t-shirt up. Taiga helped by lifting his arms above his head and wriggling until Juri got it from under his back. Juri dropped the shirt on the bed and stared down at Taiga with marvel and arousal in his eyes.</p><p>“You’re so…” Juri started, but stopped abruptly.</p><p>“So what?” Taiga prompted, and Juri made a face.</p><p>“I was gonna say ‘so flat’, but I realized it was just gonna sound bad.”</p><p>Taiga snorted. “Flat as in I’ve got no boobs?” he suggested, and Juri smirked.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Why don’t you try with your hands, too? Excluding the obvious technicalities, I think that’s the biggest difference between sleeping with a guy or sleeping with a girl. Girls are so soft. Not just the curves, but also their skin overall. In my experience, guys tend to be firmer, regardless of the amount of actual muscle.”</p><p>“Is your experience a wide pool of reference?” Juri asked, his tone chatty rather than prying.</p><p>Taiga simply grinned. “Not really. But just look at me though. I’m no bodybuilder, and I’m still firmer in the way I meant.”</p><p>“I am looking,” Juri murmured distractedly and slowly splayed his both palms on Taiga’s chest, dragging them up and down until Taiga’s eyes fluttered shut. “Yeah. I get what you mean.”</p><p>To Taiga’s delight, he didn’t even need to ask Juri to touch him more when Juri already leaned down to leave a trail of kisses on Taiga’s neck, collarbones, chest, and belly. It felt so good to feel Juri’s warm hands and lips on him, Taiga felt like melting into Juri’s mattress. Taiga sighed deeply, watching through half-closed lips how Juri pulled off his own white shirt and dropped it to the edge of the bed, too.</p><p>“You look good,” he said under his breath. “You know I imagined this the whole evening. Ever since you said you wanted to fuck me.”</p><p>Juri’s breath caught in his throat and he let out a small, breathy laugh. “Really?”</p><p>“I seriously considered joining you at the showers,” Taiga hummed and rolled his hips against Juri’s crotch to make him aware of his half-hard cock. If he had noticed it, he hadn't said anything about it. That wouldn't do. Juri gasped and grinded down to meet Taiga’s movement, causing them both to shiver at the pleasure of the friction.</p><p>“Take off my pants. And yours too,” Taiga said, warming up to the idea of ordering Juri around. Sure, he had imagined it the other way around earlier, but he didn’t mind at all. Juri seemed to like getting instructions, so he could work with that, Taiga thought and lifted his hips so that Juri could drag down his pants, boxers and socks at once. He watched hungrily when Juri stood up and undressed himself as well.</p><p>Juri had left the lamp on in the living room, and the dim gleam through the doorway made the shadows seem even deeper in the dark bedroom. Coming from behind Juri’s back the warm light beautifully highlighted the outlines of his body and wiry muscles while leaving most of his face into darkness, and Taiga suddenly wished he had his camera on hand. It would have made such a dramatic yet delicate picture. Wonder if Juri would let him take a picture like that another time? He’d have to ask about it later.</p><p>“I take it you haven’t touched another guy like this before,” Taiga said. Juri shook his head minutely, but Taiga was glad to see he looked curious and impatient rather than nervous. “Let’s start easy. Come here and touch me like you'd like to have yourself touched.”</p><p>Juri sat back to Taiga’s side and carefully took Taiga’s cock into his warm, steady hand.</p><p>“I like to start slowly,” he murmured while gently moving his hand up and down along the shaft, “I’ll want lube eventually if I’m gonna continue longer, but usually I just start like this.”</p><p>Taiga hummed quietly and closed his eyes again, lazily bucking up to meet Juri’s movement. “Move your hand a bit lower,” he said quietly. “Yeah, perfect.” Apparently Taiga liked the same things Juri did. It was easy to let himself just lie there and enjoy Juri's touches.</p><p>“The lube,” Juri said after a while and reached across Taiga to fish a plastic tube from under his other pillow. “How much?”</p><p>“More rather than less,” Taiga said, and felt the corners of his mouth twist up when Juri poured a <i>very</i> liberal amount of lube on his cock. “I didn't mean you should marinate me with it.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Juri chuckled, dropped the tube on the bed and continued jerking Taiga’s cock, now with faster, firmer movement that made Taiga whimper with pleasure whenever he twisted his hand just right.</p><p>“Have you - have you ever had anal sex with a girl?” Taiga asked, gasping between his increasingly heavy breaths.</p><p>“Never dared to ask,” Juri admited with a grimace. “But I know what to do. In theory, at least.”</p><p>Taiga smiled, stopping Juri’s hand with a loose hold around his wrist. “The theory is the same. Lots of lube, gently with one finger at first, faster and more fingers when I say so.”</p><p>Juri raised a brow. “Wow, you sure know how to make it sound hot and alluring,” he said wryly, and Taiga swatted his arm lightly.</p><p>“Shut up and give me your fingers, smartass.”</p><p>Juri did, and he was so careful about it that Taiga felt sincerely touched, though he kind of wanted to cry in sheer frustration at the same time. Juri’s movements were so tentative and gentle when he moved his finger inside Taiga, that it felt like as if he was teasing on purpose, yet it was obvious from Juri’s concentrated expression that he was being extremely serious about it. Taiga wanted more - he <i>needed</i> it. But he also didn’t want to make Juri feel like he wasn’t doing well, because Juri was doing <i>great</i>. He always did well at things he properly put his mind to. Taiga barked a small half-laughter that mostly sounded like a mixture of a wheeze and a gasp.</p><p>“You alright? Is there enough lube?” Juri asked, genuinely concerned when Taiga told him to put in another finger. “I’m not hurting you, am I?”</p><p>“Yes I am, yes there is, no you’re not,” Taiga grunted, dropping his head to the pillow and arching his back, almost desperately trying to buck his hips against Juri’s fingers when he pushed them in. “Come on Juri, you’re not gonna break me!”</p><p>“Wanna make it good for you,” Juri mumbled, looking rather awed as he stared at his hand.</p><p>This time Taiga laughed for real. “You are. But hook your fingers upwards like - <i>ah</i> - fuck yes just like that!”</p><p>Juri, like the fast learner he was, didn’t wait to be told to do the same thing again. At the same time he finally sped up a bit, making Taiga shudder and whimper with his touches until Taiga had to stop him again. He was close, and he eagerly wanted to get Juri’s cock inside him, no matter how well Juri was using his fingers.</p><p>“Lay down,” Taiga said, guiding Juri to lie next to him. “Your turn.”</p><p>Juri obeyed him easily, and Taiga bit his lower lip in anticipation when he looked at Juri’s cock, hard and heavy where it lay on Juri’s belly. He kind of wanted to praise Juri for having so valiantly waited until now without having been touched at all, but he wasn't sure if that was something Juri would like. Besides, he was about to get some well-deserved attention right now.</p><p>“Condoms,” Juri said suddenly, before Taiga had time to do anything. “I’ve got a packet in the drawer by the window.” Taiga got up and went to fetch the condoms, moving slowly and deliberately despite his ever-growing need. He could feel Juri’s gaze following him as he padded across the room, and fully enjoyed the feeling of being watched.</p><p>“I’d like to suck you,” Taiga announced when he returned to the bed and threw the cardboard packet on the mattress next to Juri’s head. “Want me to use the condom for that, too?”</p><p>Juri shuddered at the direct proposition, but he shook his head. “No need on my account, unless you want to. I’m tested. Just hate the mess.”</p><p>Taiga smiled. “Same. Though it can be quite hot, too.” Juri swallowed, eyes suddenly vacant in a way that revealed he was definitely imagining it in his head and liking what he saw. Taiga pushed Juri’s legs apart, lay down between them and finally wrapped his hand around Juri’s cock. Juri sighed deeply and fell completely relaxed under Taiga’s hands as if someone had unplugged the power cord from him. Taiga leaned down and took the head of Juri’s cock into his mouth, lapping it with his tongue and gently sucking at the head.</p><p>“So good,” Juri murmured in a husky voice that immediately went down to Taiga’s own cock, and he leaned in more, licking around the head and moving his hand at the base in the same rhythm until Juri hastily patted his shoulder.</p><p>“Gonna cum if you go on,” he groaned and groped around the mattress with his other hand until he found the lube and the condom carton and handed them to Taiga. Taiga ripped apart one foil packet from the carton. Juri sighed deeply when Taiga rolled the condom on his cock, squeezed a dollop of lube on him, and used his hands to spread it to the whole length. Then he easily straddled Juri in turn, standing on his knees and looking down into Juri’s eyes.</p><p>“You look quite ready,” he said with a lopsided smile. Juri nodded quickly. “Remember, tell me to stop or slow down if you need me to.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Juri promised with an actual mock salute, a hand on his temple, and Taiga laughed affectionately, shaking his head. Then he reached behind himself to hold Juri’s cock again so he could guide it to his hole.</p><p>A surprised mewl escaped Juri’s mouth and his hands flew to Taiga’s thighs when Taiga slowly lowered himself down on him until he was sitting on Juri’s hips with his full weight, Juri’s cock as deep in him as he could possibly get it. Taiga closed his eyes for a moment, gently rolling his hips and reveling in the deliciously satisfying feeling of fullness.</p><p>“Feeling good?” Juri rasped, his chest moving up and down with his heavy breathing.</p><p>“Was going to ask you to same,” Taiga admitted, which emitted a bark of laughter from Juri. Taiga grinned. “Alright, hold on.”</p><p>He laid his lube-sticky hands on Juri’s chest and started moving up and down. He was finally, <i>finally</i> able to ride Juri’s cock the way he had wanted the whole evening: fast and intense, a bit on the rough side, and he loved every second of it. Juri quickly caught up with his rhythm, squeezing Taiga’s thighs with his hands and bucking up into him with equal vigor.</p><p>"Fuck it feels good," he praised, and was rewarded with a deliberately sharp push from Juri. Taiga's breath caught in his throat when the pleasure hit him again and again. "Who, ah, who taught you to aim like that?"</p><p>“You did,” Juri answered breathily, "Just a moment ago, remember?" Then he laughed incredulously. "Shit, I'm not gonna last much longer."</p><p>“Me neither,” Taiga grunted, grabbing his own cock and stroking it swiftly, rolling his hips even harder, chasing his pleasure higher, higher, until Juri’s shudder and loud moan brought him over the edge as well. He opened his eyes just in time to see the spurts of his own cum land on Juri’s belly, the cloudy-white liquid glistening in the dim light. It looked…pretty. The thought felt so bizarre, Taiga let out an amused exhale. But when Juri opened his eyes and looked back at him with half-closed eyelids and a soft, satisfied smile, Taiga decided it wasn’t that strange after all. Juri was very, very pretty to look at, with Taiga’s cum and all.</p><p>“Wow,” Juri breathed, dropping a hand on his face.</p><p>“Wow,” Taiga agreed, slowly raised to his knees and flopped down to the bed. Juri sat up, rolled off the condom and tied it up before dropping it to the floor by the bed to wait for disposing. Then he just sat here for a moment, looking searchingly around until he sighed and picked up his boxers from the floor where he had dropped them. He didn’t put them on though, just wiped his belly clean with the soft fabric.</p><p>“Gonna put these to laundry anyway,” he muttered, though Taiga wasn’t quite sure if he was explaining himself to Taiga or merely thinking aloud.</p><p>“Come here,” Taiga said and sighed contently when Juri rolled back to his side so they were lying face to face, knees bumping together and heads resting on the same pillow. Juri ran his fingertips lightly on Taiga’s arm, a feather-light touch that left a pleasant, tingling feeling on Taiga’s skin.</p><p>“All good?” Taiga asked, wanting to be sure even though he felt quite confident about the answer.</p><p>“Perfect,” Juri assured.</p><p>They lay in comfortable silence for a while, listening to their slowing breaths. Taiga stretched his legs and rolled his shoulders before relaxing again. “Can I have one more kiss?”</p><p>“As many as you want,” Juri promised, pulling Taiga into his arms and kissing him so gently, it made Taiga’s heart skip a beat. Juri might not have fucked a guy before, but he damn well knew how to kiss someone breathless.</p><p>Letting his head fall back to the pillow, Juri yawned widely. “I’m gonna crash,” he murmured.</p><p>“Can I stay for the night?” Taiga asked, though he had absolutely no intent to move anywhere at all.</p><p>“You’d better,” Juri said drowsily as he turned to his other side, pulled Taiga’s arm around his own waist and shifted backwards until their bodies were perfectly lined up from head to toes, Juri’s back tightly against Taiga’s chest, their legs tangled together, and Taiga’s nose pressed into the nape of Juri’s neck. “I’m butt naked and lying on top of the bedcover. I’ll get cold if you leave now.”</p><p>“We can’t have that,” Taiga chuckled and rubbed his nose to Juri’s neck, closing his eyes too. Of course he would kick them both up in a minute or so they could crawl under the actual beddings, but for now he was content exactly where he was.</p>
