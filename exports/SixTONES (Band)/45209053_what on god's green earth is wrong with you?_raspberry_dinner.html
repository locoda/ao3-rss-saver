      <p>Jesse was offended, to put it bluntly. He was offended that his loving (yet mildly terrifying) boyfriend had interrupted his daydreaming while he was supposed to be cleaning the espresso machine at work. The non-stop buzzing of his Apple Watch was really starting to get on his nerves. However, it just kept going. Everytime he assumed that the 5’10 ball of rage that he absolutely adored snuggling with at night would give up, another call came in.</p><p> </p><p>As the calls continued to come, he felt his mild irritation start to shift into fear as the realization set in. It was evident that Hokuto, for whatever reason, had left his university campus early and had returned home before Jesse had a chance to either hide the evidence or prepare for the worst. To state it as simply as possible, he was fucked.</p><p> </p><p>After his watch stopped buzzing and immediately started to do so again, he sighed and slipped away to the backroom, much to his co-worker’s annoyance as a customer chose that exact moment to walk in. Jesse took his phone out of his pocket and just looked at the caller ID, trying to compose himself. Usually he loved when he received calls from “Hokkun 🥰🥰🥰,” but this time he was nearly shaking in his shoes. He took a deep breath and finally pressed accept.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi dear-”</p><p><em>“Jes, what the fuck is this?”</em> No amount of time could have prepared him for the sharp tone that stabbed him through the receiver.</p><p>“What the fuck is what?”</p><p><em>“Don’t play dumb. There’s a massive box in the lobby for you, and the building staff won’t let me leave until I take it up to our apartment. I can’t move this by myself,”</em> the sharpness quickly faded into irritation, a tone Jesse was quite familiar with in the other’s voice. They had only been dating for just over two years, yet everyone always told them they fight like an old married couple. That is, if “fighting” meant Jesse doing something stupid or impulsive, Hokuto scolding him, and then the both of them immediately going out for dessert afterwards.</p><p>“Hokuto, my shift ends in two hours. I’ll be home soon.”</p><p>
  <em>“No, you’re coming home now. I have a three hour lecture that starts in 45 minutes. And then I have a lab afterwards. And then I have to TA for profess-”</em>
</p><p>“Okay, okay, I’m coming. I’ll tell the shift manager I had a family emergency.”</p><p><em>“Thank you. Love you, Jes.”</em> Jesse’s fear once again shifted into irritation as he heard the sound of the call disconnecting before he even had a chance to say, “I love you too.” That, and the fact that he now had to deal with the pissiest shift manager. He quickly pulled up his notes app and scrolled until he found the one simply titled “excuses to get out of work.” The things one dumbass would do for another.</p><p> </p><p>After giving Mr. Pissy Man his heartfelt spiel about his sister being hospitalized following an incident regarding a tree, he clocked out and sprinted all the way back to his building. It was only an eight minute walk from his apartment complex to the cafe; however, every minute he spent keeping Hokuto waiting was another minute he would spend in Hell for his actions. So, he made the full journey in four.</p><p> </p><p>He entered the lobby and almost instantly felt numerous glares fall onto him. Nearly every building employee was staring at him with disgust. Typically, he wouldn’t get this kind of treatment merely for receiving a package; however, it didn’t take long for him to catch onto his adorable, wonderful, dearest boyfriend arguing loudly with their landlord in the corner of the lobby. He couldn’t blame the staff, he’d be in an awful mood too if he had to deal with Hokuto like this. While his boyfriend looked like he’d be the quiet type purely based on his appearance, he was as persistent as an ox and never took no for an answer. It was nice sometimes, as Jesse wasn’t the type to say “I asked for cheese on this” when a McDonald’s employee screwed up his order, but there were other times where he could be a bit much to people who weren’t used to him.</p><p> </p><p>After what felt like minutes of standing in silence, Hokuto finally noticed his appearance and promptly left the landlord to head over to him.</p><p> </p><p>“What the Hell did you even order?” He flinched at Hokuto’s tone. It seemed that he had calmed down over the phone, but evidently he had riled himself up again after fighting with every individual within a two mile radius. Jesse panicked, he knew the real answer wouldn’t satisfy his partner. So ultimately, he decided to do what he always did in times of crisis: pin the blame on someone else.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you even know it’s mine?” He said while very obviously avoiding eye contact and not even attempting to hide the lie in his voice.</p><p>“Did you forget what country you’re in? How many <em><strong>Jesses</strong></em> do you think live in this building?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck.</em> Well, he never said he was good at passing the blame, just that he did it a lot. However, he always forgot that Hokuto saw through him every time. He had to come up with another excuse. He wasn’t ready to die just yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Earth to Jes. You in there?”</p><p>“No?”</p><p> </p><p>He dared to take a glance up at his boyfriend, firmly believing that his ears had been deceiving him. But alas, they served him with great obedience. He really wasn’t hallucinating Hokuto laughing. Any former sense of anger had completely faded from his face, replaced by pure glee. Likely glee as a result of exasperation, but glee nonetheless. Hokuto’s smile was something that Jesse had to earn, and apparently his weak attempt to fight back had done just that.</p><p> </p><p><br/>“Let’s just get this thing upstairs. I’m already gonna be late at this point, just get it over and done with. Arguing with you isn’t gonna get me to class.”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse absolutely ADORED it when the other was too busy to argue, mostly because those were the only times that the handsome black-haired ever lost. He simply smiled in response and helped him hoist it as they headed towards the stairs. Hokuto faced backwards and led the way at the top while Jesse pushed upwards from the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>The entire situation was a result of the old facilities in their building. The elevator had been broken for two weeks with nothing but empty promises for it to be fixed. It ended up being quite annoying for the two of them who lived on the fifth floor, especially now that they had a dubiously heavy package with unknown contents (to one of them) to carry up. But through sheer hard work, sweat, a lot of complaining from one half of the pair and a nearly broken toe, they managed to get it to the door of their apartment.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto unlocked and held the door open for Jesse to shove it in the apartment before immediately booking it down the hallway and back down the stairs. Upon checking his watch, Jesse realized that the shorter was already twenty minutes late for his class. He felt mildly bad before remembering that 90% of the situation was caused by him bitching at the staff. However, that was the man he had fallen head over heels in love with, grade A bitch or not.</p><p> </p><p>❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤</p><p> </p><p>Several hours later, Hokuto finally returned home feeling more exhausted than he ever had before. His taxing schedule always left him drained, but adding dragging Jesse’s God-knows-what up five flights of stairs and a straight mile and a half sprint to campus on top of that had absolutely killed him. He was dead. He was the one who cooked dinner every night because his stupid boyfriend doesn’t know how to eat properly, however, he wouldn’t argue tonight if the other asked to order pizza.</p><p> </p><p>Upon arrival at his apartment building, he ignored the glares from the remainder of the staff and dedicated his own frustration towards the stairs. He mentally prepared himself for the hike before beginning the dredge up the mountain.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t quite sure how he did it, but he didn’t collapse the second he reached their floor. He only completed the trek because he kept reminding himself that cuddles and a hot shower awaited him at his destination. Slowly but surely, he made his way to their apartment at the end of the hallway. Using the last of his energy, he unlocked the door and welcomed himself inside.</p><p> </p><p>“Tadaima.”</p><p>“Okae-”</p><p>“Jes, what the FUCK?!”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto couldn’t believe what he was seeing. His stupid boyfriend (that he truly loved with all of his heart) was sitting on a goddamn PELOTON that definitely wasn’t there before while watching TV.</p><p> </p><p>“You kept complaining about hating the empty corner in here, so I bought something to fill it.”</p><p> </p><p>All of this. Over an exercise bike. That they didn’t need. And would likely never use again after a month’s time.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck it. Hokuto didn’t have the energy to deal with this. He sighed and immediately collapsed on the couch. It was the thought that counted at the end of the day, right? Jesse bought it because he thought that it would make him happy, <em><strong>right?</strong></em></p><p> </p><p>“Jes. I really, really love you.</p><p>But,</p><p> </p><p>
