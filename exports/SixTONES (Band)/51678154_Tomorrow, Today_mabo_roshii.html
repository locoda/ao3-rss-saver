<p>Thrilled. That would probably be best word to describe how Taiga felt at the moment, as it was finally the day he had been waiting for so long. He had placed so much hopes in this day. That maybe, just maybe, they would pick him the one he had had a secret crush on for few years. He had never acted on his feelings out of fear that the other might not return them. They were of different social ranking, that alone could be enough to raise problems. But the other one was so well put together, while he was socially clumsy.</p><p>He was well aware that the choice he was praying for was probably the worst nightmare of his parents, but he couldn't care less. He didn't want anyone of the same status as he as he found them pompous. Anyone of them would have been happy to be paired up with him, but that was all just because of his family's status, nothing to do with him as a person. So he himself was hoping for a person of lower status. Of course they also would be over the moon to get a pair of his social ranking, but at least the ones he had had as class mates before were tolerable when they were trying to get on his good side compared to the ones that came over with their parents for dinners and went to private schools.</p><p>Taiga hadn’t attended those schools, because even if his parents were proud of their standing, they also believed that it was important to understand how the world operated depending on where you stood. So, Taiga had been sent to a regular school for him to learn the ways of the world. That was also were he had met the other boy.</p><p>He had already chosen his outfit the previous night,but was now rethinking his choice. Was it perhaps too classy, too high end? He sighed in frustration as he opened his walking closet again and started to go through his selection. The suit had been what his parents wished for, and he had chosen out the one he liked the best. A simple piece in dark grey. But now it felt bogus as that wasn’t who he really was. He felt more like himself in a pair of simple black trousers, white t-shirt and a jacket in modern cut. That was also what he ended up wearing. They were asked to dress nicely for the event, but there wasn’t a dress code so his outfit would be more than enough.</p><p>Once he was dressed, he gave himself a one over in the mirror and nodded his head. This would do.</p><p>***</p><p>Kouchi stared at the pile of clothes on his desk chair. The clothes. The ones he was going to wear for the lottery event.</p><p>He huffed as he got up from his bed and crapped the trousers from the pile. There was no point avoiding it anymore he thought at the same time as he put his feet through the trouser legs. The situation would only get worse for him should he not attend and get his future partner picked out for him. On to the simple white button down. There were punishments for those who didn’t show up to the event.</p><p>So, it was better at this point to attend the event and hope that they had picked him someone according to the wishes he had filled in that lottery ticket. It was not unheard of that the government picked against its citizens’ wishes, but it wasn’t common either. And considering that he really didn’t fancy girls, he prayed that they would pick as he had written.</p><p>Shoes on, last glance in mirror. No point in trying to style his hair.</p><p>There was just one out come in this event that just might make it a good one.</p>
