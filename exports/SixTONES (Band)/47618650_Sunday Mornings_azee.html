    <h2 class="toc-heading">Sunday Mornings</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p dir="ltr" align="justify">“Just continue showing him your photos together. Talk to him. That would really help him, Ma’am.”</p><p>On regular days, Hokuto wouldn’t eavesdrop. He always minded his own business. Listening to other people’s conversations is an invasion of their privacy. It felt so wrong. But today wasn’t a normal day. To start, he wasn’t supposed to be there. Yugo, one of his closest friends, could’ve chosen any of their other friends to accompany him. But, no. Everyone was busy on a Sunday morning. All of them. </p><p>Except for him. </p><p> </p><p>He lowered the volume of the music that he’s been listening to through his earphones. Until he couldn’t hear anything but the voice of an old woman near where he had been sitting. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you remember this?” the sweet old lady spoke, pointing her wrinkly fingers at a page in what seemed to be a photo album. “Our first date. You brought me to this sunflower field thinking that I liked them.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s eyes traveled from the smiling lady to the old man sitting beside her. His body was the first thing he noticed. Protruding bones. Tired eyes. He also noticed the adhesive bandage on the back of his left hand. His face was blank. It could be because of medication that blurred his memory. Or perhaps he couldn’t remember anything at all. </p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t stop the old lady from talking. She continued flipping through the pages of that old photo album, telling stories behind the pictures kept inside. The old man’s face remained blank. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, this one’s my favorite,” Hokuto continued to listen. Somehow, he found the couple interesting. Although, being in a hospital at their age was something to be worried about. Or maybe he was just thinking too much, so he had to listen to their stories to put him at ease. “I thought we were just having a simple dinner, but you were planning to propose. Oh, dear,” the lady giggled. </p><p> </p><p>A car stopped at the entrance of the hospital, prompting the old lady to put away the photo album. As it occupied her attention, the old man slowly reached for his wife’s hand. Hokuto saw how that took the sweet old lady’s breath. </p><p> </p><p>And a <em> fucking </em> oxygen tank came to his mind.  <em> What the fuck was wrong with him? </em> He must never go to a hospital. Never. </p><p> </p><p>Tightly closing his eyes, Hokuto dragged his attention back to his phone. As he was about to play the song that he was listening to previously, someone spoke. </p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t they cute?” the person whispered to him, giggling. A warm breath touched the skin on his neck and he didn’t like it one bit. That was an invasion of his personal space. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto slowly tilted his head in the stranger’s direction, and he was in awe. The man was wearing a loose black shirt, an old pair of pants, and some black sandals. He must really like the color black. That, or the stranger didn’t have any other color in his wardrobe. But black looked good on him, in contrast to his pale white skin. </p><p> </p><p>“Old couples, still in love after all those years that they’ve been together?” the stranger continued. “So cute.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto cleared his throat, pulling himself from his admiration to the random stranger beside him. The old couple he was watching a little while ago were now walking slowly out of the hospital lobby, hand in hand, looking at each other with fondness. </p><p> </p><p>Must be nice, Hokuto thought, still following the old couple as they got in the car. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to grow old. I mean, if given the chance, I want to die young. Not painful, just… a quick death,” Hokuto said mindlessly as the car drove away from the hospital. Silently hoping that the man wouldn’t start forgetting his wife soon enough, thinking how hard it must be for the sweet old lady.</p><p> </p><p>He looked back at the stranger on his side. The <em> beautiful </em>stranger looked at him, straight into his eyes. His eyebrows furrowed, lips tight. Probably just a few seconds of staring at each other felt like an hour for him. Hokuto had to look away.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s kinda heavy, mister,” the man said, followed by an awkward laugh, “to tell to a random person you met inside a hospital.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my bad,” Hokuto muttered. He planned to move along to ignore the person he made uncomfortable. Great. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, you don’t have to be sorry,” the man cooed. “That’s what you want. Though I hope you live a long and happy life. But I want what they have.” </p><p> </p><p>He looked at the stranger in confusion. What did he want? Did he want to be with a person who would eventually forget everything they had been through? Did he want to <em> watch </em> the love of his life die in front of his eyes? </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto knew he was exaggerating since he didn’t know the entire story about the said couple. But thinking about it, he wouldn’t want any of that, even as a trade for all the things he wanted in his life. </p><p> </p><p>“A love that wouldn’t change for the worse, even after so many years. I want to be with someone who wouldn’t leave after any storm trying to break us apart. Even when your life is nearing its end. Especially that. ” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto stared at him. A small smile broke on his face, but his eyes were bearing an unfamiliar emotion. This man kind of reminded him of Yugo. A believer in love. A hopeless romantic. Whenever Yugo acted this way, he would quickly shut his ear and bother himself with something else. Not that he didn’t believe in love, but it wasn’t something he would put time into thinking about. Or be looking for. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you want to find someone like that and get married?” the stranger continued. He looked at him again, and now a wide smile was on his face. “Cause I really want to get married, you know.” </p><p> </p><p>Why was this stranger telling him all this? </p><p> </p><p>“N-Not necessarily to you, of course. Oh gosh, that sounded like I was forcing you.” the stranger stuttered, forcing a laugh. Pink tinted his cheeks. <em> Cute </em>. “I just want to have someone to share this life with, to make it bearable, at least.” </p><p> </p><p>It sounded really nice. To have someone. Remembering the famous wedding vow: <em> for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Yeah, not for everyone. <em> Till death do us part. </em> Definitely not.</p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t it hurt?” he asked the stranger. “To see the pain in their eyes when they fully know that you’re about to reach your end?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, it would!” the man scowled at him like he had just asked the stupidest question. A part of him kinda agreed with him, though. “But why would we focus on the grim part? Death is already depressing as it is. Make the most of your remaining time together. There’s still time, you know. And I’m pretty sure that’s what the lady was doing.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto scoffed, crossing his leg. He adjusted his body to face the stranger, to get a better look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>Dammit, he really has a pretty face. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, she’s strong. But I don't think everyone can bear it.”</p><p> </p><p>The stranger stared at his face hard. Like he fascinated him. Though he quite didn’t understand why, Hokuto stared back. Then the stranger smirked, shaking his head.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, she’s strong for that. I admire her for that,” the stranger plopped his back on his seat, looking forward. “She could just leave her husband, right? After all, the years they’ve been together should’ve been enough. She doesn’t have to go through the pain of watching the person she loves deteriorate in front of her. But don’t you think leaving someone alone by himself is awful? Given their situation.” </p><p> </p><p>“If I were in the old man’s position, I would totally understand if she left. It’s for their own good. It’s for them. She’s leaving them for their own sake.” </p><p> </p><p>Given their hypothetical situation, Hokuto would definitely always choose to be left alone. Death was already a scary thing. Just thinking of his loved one getting anxious day by day if he could even make it the next day would just break him more. </p><p> </p><p>“So they can already move on while you sulk in your own little dark corner?” The stranger raised his eyebrow at him. “I feel bad that we actually thought that Grandpa was already dying. He could have been just groggy from medication. Probably from anesthesia or something.” </p><p> </p><p>“You started it,” Hokuto stated. </p><p> </p><p>The stranger’s eyes widened in disbelief. “But it was you who said that you want to have a quick death.” </p><p> </p><p>They cut their conversation short when Yugo arrived back in the lobby. His friend had to pay a quick visit to his brother. Not a patient, but a doctor in this hospital. He had been close to the Kochis ever since junior high, but he would never go deep inside a hospital just to see Yugo’s older brother. He refused to move even one step away from the main entrance. Not even when his bladder was full. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto found hospitals unsettling. Yes, he knew it wasn't all about bad news that would eventually lead to death. Hospitals bring life and second chances. Still, he just couldn’t find any safe comfort inside, not even a tiny bit. </p><p> </p><p>“Who was that?” Yugo asked when they got inside the vehicle. His friend gave him a quick glance before maneuvering the car to the highway. Finally, he felt relieved. “A friend?” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto scoffed. “You’re expecting too much from me. I don’t have many friends. And most of them, you’ve met.” </p><p> </p><p>Yugo chuckled. One hand was busy setting the air conditioning unit to his preference, while the other was holding the steering wheel. “I don’t know. Maybe you bumped your head somewhere and became friendly.” </p><p> </p><p>“Please.” Hokuto adjusted his seat, flattening his back against the cushion of his seat. “Are you dropping me home now?” </p><p> </p><p>“Eager to laze on your couch, aren’t you?” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a Sunday. I’m supposed to be lazing on my new couch,” he whined. His brows furrowed when the car turned in the opposite direction, driving away from their neighborhood. “Where are we going?” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s Sunday, so we’re going to have brunch!” Yugo announced enthusiastically, and he didn’t find the idea impressive. </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, no. Drop me off.” Hokuto groaned. “I want to go home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, I’ll drop you in the middle of this highway,” Yugo smirked as the car halted by the intersection. “Maybe spending your precious Sunday doing community service for jaywalking is better than spending it eating brunch with your friends.” </p><p> </p><p>“Friends? Who else is coming?” </p><p> </p><p>Gone was his plan of playing a newly released game on his new couch. Now, he was seated inside some restaurant called 'Sunday Mornings'. The Interior had a modern vibe and was almost surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass windows that allowed the sunlight to peek through. Not bad. He just needed to taste their food and he’d be okay spending his morning out. If their food was bland, he’d have Yugo pay for his meal. </p><p> </p><p>“This place is cool! How did you find this place, Kochi?” Jesse asked, occupying the vacant seat just beside Yugo. Jesse just spent five minutes inside the restaurant taking photos on his phone, saying that this place was IG-worthy. He agreed and couldn’t wait to eat their food. </p><p>“Uh, someone.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good taste, huh.” </p><p> </p><p>“Uh huh,”</p><p> </p><p>Jesse handed him one of the menus. He had already browsed through them. There were too many choices for him. </p><p> </p><p>He was just waiting for Kochi to pick food from the menu. However, his friend was stealing glances at the counter. It was a simple one, just a cash register, a small display counter with various selections of desserts. He couldn’t see what was interesting behind the counter. Not until one of the staff, he supposed, walked out. How Yugo smiled instantly didn’t escape from Hokuto’s eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll be paying for my food, Kochi Yugo.” Hokuto sighed, wishing that he was instead in the comfort of his own home.</p>
