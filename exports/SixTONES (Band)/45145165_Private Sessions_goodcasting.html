<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Moans and sighs filled the room as Hokuto watched a man and woman sort of squelching about in the middle of a circular bed. The man was clearly taking his sweet time, giving her slow and deep thrusts, while the woman seemed to want her release soon, as she started pushing back to meet his thrust.</p><p> </p><p>A lot of questions formed in Hokuto’s head. Are they really enjoying the sex with almost a dozen people around them? Is she really okay with being seen getting pumped by a stranger? Did they really think those half-masquerade masks adorned with glitters and feathers could really hide their identity? He sighed and crossed his arms. He is hopeless. What happened to the raging hormones of his youth? Why is he looking at these shagging individuals as though he was watching a documentary and not for what it was, a paraphilic interest, kink, fetish, or just sex? He was thinking too much when he should enjoy being in this real-life Stanley Kubrick movie. </p><p> </p><p>“This is pretty tame,” Juri said. Hokuto couldn’t see his face but he could tell from his voice that he was fighting a yawn. </p><p> </p><p>“Should we look for a threesome-foursome?” Juri asked. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed. “I appreciate that you brought me here to your exclusive club, but I think I need to go home-”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Juri snapped. “We’re going to fix your problem.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have a problem,” he muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever. I think there’s an S&amp;M somewhere, it’s quite popular so expect the room to be packed,” Juri finished and dragged him out of the room, Hokuto’s protests fell on deaf ears. They reached the 3rd-floor landing and were greeted with a very oily foursome on a marble floor. Hokuto had to bite his tongue to stop himself from saying that they should be careful, or they might slide off. They walked further and checked rooms covered with curtains only. Rooms with curtains meant that everyone was invited to watch, while those with locked doors meant exclusivity. They went deeper into the mansion, and Hokuto was starting to appreciate the house’s ritzy design, which he thought was such a shame because he didn’t think anyone would have time to admire it when they were mostly lost in rapture. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that…anal?” Juri whispered when they entered another room. Her back was turned against them and she was riding a cock on her ass. Her alabaster skin glistened with sweat while she moved with ease and urgency as though she wanted to climax so badly. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto decided to stare at the painting at the ceiling, and it was so absurd that the painting were a replica of a portion of Michaelangelo’s “The Last Judgment”. It was quite ironic that these people were doing the very thing that could have barred them from heaven. While he is also sinning because even though he made a resolve never to judge anyone he would see at this place, anal sex remained taboo for him. He couldn’t imagine doing it to someone, or worse, being the receiver. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh…they are both men,” Juri added with a degree of shock, which made Hokuto look back at the bed. </p><p> </p><p>From cowboy, they’ve shifted to doggy style. The “woman” on top earlier was clearly a man judging by his unmistakable erect penis that shook with each hard thrust. His legs were pretty hairy compared to his smooth torso, while sounds of ecstasy escaped his slightly parted lips. He glanced in their direction and despite a sequined blue mask covering half of his face, Hokuto could clearly see the invitation from his eyes. Those eyes were speaking to him, asking him to start touching himself and jump in. Hokuto shook his head as the man also broke eye contact, he definitely misread it. He wasn't being asked to join the fornication, his eyes must have looked like that because it was clouded with lust and psychedelics, or probably both. </p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t really my cup of tea, are you up for S&amp;M?” Juri asked, but he didn’t wait for a reply as he pulled him away from the room. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto made a quick glance back, and the man with the sequined blue mask was now lying on his back with his legs propped up. It was as though he was telling the angels and saints in the painting above that they could have heaven, and he’d rather go to hell and have his own kind of heaven.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“So the king is pressured to produce an heir, but he is also gay and very much in love with his general, so he asked his general to get the queen knocked up on his behalf.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded as Kouchi narrated the plot of his upcoming movie. “Eventually, the general, who I will be playing, falls for the queen, and the king orders my death.” </p><p> </p><p>“So you will fuck the queen?” Kouchi asked, his eyes gleaming with malice. It was like nothing mattered about the plot but those scenes, which Hokuto had some apprehension about. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes and the king will also fuck me,” he said, trying to appear nonchalant while his mind replayed to that scene he saw the other night underneath Michaelangelo’s “The Last Judgment”.</p><p> </p><p>“So you will be used a lot. Front and back.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded glumly. “A lot. You will see a lot of my ass.” </p><p> </p><p>Kouchi whistled. “Will there be frontal nudity? Not yours though,” he added quickly as he stopped the car in the driveway. </p><p> </p><p>“Just watched the movie,” Hokuto said and opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to fetch you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’ll take the taxi home, thank you for dropping me off,” he said and waved his best friend goodbye. </p><p> </p><p>His manager was already waiting for him at the lounge when he arrived at the studio and he couldn’t shake off the unease he started feeling when the director called to meet him again. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you think Shinji-san will replace me?" He asked with worry as they climbed the stairs. There was a lot of backlashes when he was announced to be one of the lead actors for “A Frozen Flower” remake, most backlash was about him not being a "proper actor". Most people still see him as an idol, and there were also growing concerns that such a serious-themed movie would be treated as an extension of his fans’ fantasies.</p><p> </p><p>"We already signed the contract," his manager replied, and Hokuto could see that even he wasn't that confident. “You also passed the audition fair and square, we both know that the agency didn’t want you to do this,” he added.</p><p> </p><p>"Right? Right!" He psyched himself up for this sudden meeting. The director didn’t say anything except asked for his free time, and he could only hope that was not getting sacked.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Hokuto!" Shinji-san greeted him warmly. He didn't look like he was about to deliver bad news, but Hokuto still felt uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you spoken to Jun and Shun?" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shook his head. It would be his first time working with Sakurazawa Jun and Katori Shun and they haven’t really broken the ice. “Uhm, no. Is there something – ?”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, they already did this before you. Jun was the first one, Shun did this yesterday, and you're next. But of course, I don't want you to think that I'm hindering how you want to tackle this role, but I really think that this could better our movie."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded even though he still had no idea what he would be doing. "Sure, anything for the movie," he said with feigned enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>"Cool! If you permit it, you will be meeting an intimacy coordinator."</p><p> </p><p>"Intimacy coordinator?" He clarified. He thinks he heard the term before.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. It’s a fairly new profession in Hollywood whose job is to help the actors adjust and make their intimate scenes as comfortable as possible and to ensure that they are not being taken advantage of.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…I see,” Hokuto mumbled, and whether he admitted it or not, he might need one in real life. </p><p> </p><p>“I've already told him my vision about this movie, particularly on how I wanted those intimate scenes to be executed. Now, it's your turn to tell him any of your concerns about your intimate scenes, and he will be like your advocate or your negotiator. He won't exactly be directing you, that would still be my job, but he could help you and me to choreograph those scenes that won’t overstep the boundaries you’ve set." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could only nod in awe. He had no idea such a profession now existed, and he should have met this intimacy coordinator days ago instead of being dragged to that “house of sin.”</p><p> </p><p>“So do you wish to meet him?”</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, I'll meet him," Hokuto replied all too quickly. </p><p> </p><p>"That’s great then! I'll be leaving the two of you, feel free to tell him anything," Shinji-san said. He got up and knocked on the blue-colored door inside his office, it immediately opened to reveal one of the prettiest faces he had ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>Shinji-san’s guest looked at Hokuto, or more like studied him as soon as their eyes met. Hokuto thought there was something eerily familiar with those eyes, which should be weird because he doubted he would ever forget this man's face if they'd met before. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, this is Kyomoto Taiga, an intimacy coordinator. He just arrived a week ago from Los Angeles." </p><p> </p><p>They shook hands, Taiga's grip was strong but his hand was soft.</p><p> </p><p>"Hi, Kyomoto-san," he replied meekly.</p><p> </p><p>"Please, just call me Taiga."</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga."</p><p> </p><p>They sat across from each other as Shinji left his office and Hokuto realized that his heart had been racing. Suddenly, he was met with anxiety. How could he agree to this? How could he share anything intimate with a man he just met? </p><p> </p><p>"I know this feels odd," Taiga said.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a deep breath and willing himself to relax. He would only be telling Taiga his sex concerns in the movie and not about his real life. </p><p> </p><p>"Quite a bit," he admitted.</p><p> </p><p>"And I apologize that I might make you feel more uncomfortable…"</p><p> </p><p>"Uhm, what do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga opened the folder in his hand, and Hokuto thought that this meeting was starting to feel like a therapy session.</p><p> </p><p>"So…" Taiga started, his eyes moved to his crotch, which made Hokuto cross his legs and his action made Taiga smile, "will you let me enter your backdoor?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Back…door? Whatever do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Will you let me fuck you?” </p><p>

  <span>There were a lot of things that could leave Hokuto agog, and being asked to be fuck is clearly one of it. He was not sure whether Taiga was joking or not. He hoped he could think of a witty reply or a strong comeback, but he simply stared like a loony as though he was actually considering agreeing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pretend that I was the king,” Taiga said and Hokuto went, “oh!” Of course, Taiga is trying to get into character.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But I don’t think the king would even ask for permission,” Hokuto replied and realized that he was kind of telling this man that he could just go ahead and do him. “I mean, the king’s words are like gold, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have a point,” he said and crossed his legs, “an oversight on my part, but you’re basically saying that you would agree?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto cleared his throat. “By you…do you mean my character?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga nodded. “Of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course,” he repeated and sighed. He didn’t know what he was nervous about. “Whether I agree or not, but considering my role in the palace, and my loyalty to the king…yes, I have to serve him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think your character is in love with the king?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded. “He does. He revered him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But your character also fell so in love with the queen that you even betrayed the king.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto shrugged. “Plot-wise, I believe the queen is his first taste with women, and I can’t blame him for falling in love.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you still think you were in love with the king?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto hesitated before nodding. “Definitely.” He didn’t think they would be doing character analysis and he regretted not delving further into the script yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga nodded while he made notes on the pad in that folder of his, even though Hokuto could see that Taiga didn’t fully agree with his assessments of his character, and he was dying to know what Taiga had written. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How about personally? Would you do anything the director tells you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto’s answer was immediate. “Of course, I’m a proper actor, I follow what the director wants.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What he said made Taiga raise an eyebrow. “What about your personal boundaries?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m an actor. I’m contractually obligated to follow the director’s vision.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So you’re telling me that even if it makes you uncomfortable, even if it’s encroaching on your personal space, you are okay with that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto wanted to nod, but Taiga had this aura that once he agreed to what he said, that folder might fly to his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You see,” Hokuto started to explain instead, “I’m an idol before I’m an actor. I already get enough flak for getting lead roles, and I don’t want people to think that I’m a difficult actor to work with. So if the director tells me to wank him off and it's part of the script, I would wank him off.” Maybe he should have just agreed to what Taiga said earlier, instead of baring part of his weakness to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga smiled, which to Hokuto came off as sarcastic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve already spoken to two of your co-stars and I knew that doing my job here is going to be hard. And the main reason is that you guys are too polite and too respectful to your seniors and to the higher-ups to even decline.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded, at least Taiga understood the cultural aspect of his work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s why you should consider yourself lucky because Shinji-san is not only progressive, but he’s doing this to protect his actors. It is true that you’re hired to act, but just like with filming stunt scenes where it needs your consent, where you’re free to use a stunt double, and where scenes have to be rehearsed repeatedly to ensure safety; your sex scenes will be filmed like that. Everything from kissing, touching, and body movements will be choreographed without any of you feeling that you’ve been taken advantage of.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto fought not to gape from what Taiga had said. He might not have listened properly to what Shinji-san said earlier it sounded surreal starting with him using the term “choreograph”. He didn’t think that there is a sex choreography. The last time he did a sexy scene for TV, the director only informed them about their blocking and they just did it how it was in the script; kiss, straddle him, remove his clothes, fall together on the bed, and so on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s why it’s important that I know your concerns and your preferences. What are you and what are you not comfortable doing? Where do you draw the line?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto had no answer to his questions, well, he had the answers but he didn’t know how to voice them out. He’d gotten used to saying “yes” all the time and he trusted his directors enough to know what was needed for the movie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s do a body mapping for example,” Taiga suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Body mapping?” Hokuto clarified. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yep, please stand up.” Taiga walked closer to him until they were feet apart. His eyes look really familiar, or maybe he just found them striking, but also intimidating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is an exercise where we color parts of our body with green and red. Green means okay to touch and red means hands-off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded as Taiga raised his hands to chest level, his palms up as though he was offering him something as he told him, “if you will allow me to guide you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto felt like a woman being asked for a dance as he placed his fingers on Taiga, who then caught both of his wrists. Despite Taiga’s dainty-looking fingers, Hokuto could easily tell that this is the hold of a man, strong with a feeling that he is claiming his possession. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This is something you will do with your co-stars before you filmed a scene. It’s not limited to sex scenes, but anything that would involve touching. Now…” To Hokuto’s surprise, Taiga placed his hands on his chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My chest is green,” Taiga said with a stern-looking face, while Hokuto tried his best to maintain a passive look. He kept on repeating that he is an actor, this is merely acting, and it was not like he hasn’t touched a man’s chest before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, okay…” He could feel Taiga’s leanness underneath the fabric of his hoodie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga steered his hands up on his shoulders, up to his neck and jawline, and all the while, he kept on saying, “this part is green.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cheeks and nose...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto swallowed hard as he could feel his face growing hot, Taiga had a small face that his hand alone could cover everything, and his eyes went wide when his hands half-covered Taiga’s face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All green up to my hair, back of my head, and also my nape…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga’s voice droned on as he narrated his green parts, but Hokuto’s mind had flown elsewhere. It was back at that house and under the replica of “The Last Judgment”, a man getting pleasured on his behind with his blue sequined mask as his only cover from all the rawness.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” Taiga asked with concern on his face. “Do you want me to continue? Do you feel uncomfortable doing this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto swallowed hard again and mentally shook his head. That man couldn’t be Taiga. He didn’t look like the type who would do something like that, but then again, what does he know about the man he just met? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine,” he said as he recovered. “I’m sorry. W-where were we-” He didn’t get to continue realizing that his hands were now wrapped around Taiga’s waist and their distance had gotten shorter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My lower back is green,” he said, his eyes never breaking contact. Hokuto could feel his palms gone cold and clammy as Taiga guided his hands down the curve of his bottom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’re feeling playful, this is also green.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His hands might be cold, but his entire body has grown hot. “I think…I get the gist of this body mapping,” he said and Taiga released his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cool. Now, you can also guide me on where I can or should not touch you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uhm, I’m…I’m not yet c-comfortable with that idea.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga looked proud with his answer. “Cool! Now you’re drawing your boundaries.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto feigned a laugh. He should really make a boundary before something comes bouncing out. “As I should, right?” He said and added eagerly, “I think I’m really warming to this idea.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to hear that. So, let’s discuss more of your concerns with your intimate scenes,” he said before he returned to his seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto let out a sigh of relief as he also returned to his seat. He was quite sure his discomfort stemmed from being close to Taiga, and that should never happen again. For now, this much distance from Taiga will be his “green zone”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hokuto, over here!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"You attract what you fear", </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hokuto thought while he plastered a smile on his face as he walked closer to where Juri was with two insanely attractive ladies. Juri was still dead-set on revitalizing his sex life, not that it was dead in Hokuto's defense, he has just been extremely busy with work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ladies, I'm sure you know my famous friend,” Juri said, ignoring Hokuto’s mild glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't believe him. I'm nowhere famous, it's been a month since I made an Instagram account and I haven't reached a million followers, while a senpai of mine reached a million within the day,” he said before Juri continued with the introductions. They ordered food, drank merrily, and as the night deepened and the conversation was getting pornie, Hokuto was sure that both ladies were more interested in Juri than him. He wasn’t even remotely disappointed or jealous, he just wanted to go home and sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He excused himself to go to the toilet, but in reality, he decided to pay for their meal and make his hasty exit. He was sure Juri wouldn’t mind as Juri always forgives him. There was quite a queue at the payment counter and as he glanced back to check if Juri hadn’t caught up to him sneaking out, he saw a familiar face by the bar counter, it was Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga was drinking alone while he was also busy with his phone. Hokuto thought twice about approaching him. After all, he decided to put distance between them as much as possible. Moreover, all of Taiga’s lectures on respecting personal space must have been embedded in his brain; he thinks Taiga might not need any company if he chose to sit on a bar stool and drink alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto decided to step back when a Caucasian-looking man approached Taiga, and he could only raise an eyebrow when the same man started rubbing Taiga’s back and sat beside him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"They must have known each other,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hokuto observed as Taiga let this white man touch him so intimately. He postponed sneaking out and returned to his seat, which gave him a full view of Taiga and the man. The man must have moved his seat closer to Taiga, their pelvis almost touching while Hokuto caught a glimpse of Taiga's hand traveling to the man’s thigh. They gaze longingly at one another before the man bent his head closer and whispered something, which ended with Taiga giving a curt nod, and they both prepared to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ho-ku-to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto turned to Juri as though he was roused from slumber. “You were calling me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay? What are you looking at?” Juri glanced back and the bar counter was now empty of Taiga and that foreigner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhm, nothing, just the bar design. Uhm, I need to go back to the toilet,” he said and ran to the toilet. He splashed himself with cold water and stared at his reflection. His face was all red, and during those few minutes of staring at Taiga, it felt like he was put in a trance. One of the cubicle doors opened and of all the people, it had to be Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Hokuto!” He said and washed his hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“H-hi,” he said, and quickly pulled a paper towel to dry his face. “Nice to meet you here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga simply smiled and added, “yeah, nice to see you too. Uhm, I have to go.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hokuto nodded and he didn’t know what came to him when he asked hurriedly, “and where will you go?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga glanced back, he looked a bit perplexed, but he answered in a way Hokuto didn’t expect either. “Why? Do you want to go with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga was obviously teasing him and Hokuto answered, “May I?” His reply also stunned him and he knew it wasn’t a tease. Whatever happened to his green zone? If his answer threw Taiga off, he had no idea seeing Taiga’s deadpan expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Taiga said, smiling sadly. “I’m not really into greenhorns,” he added, which left Hokuto baffled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That night, Hokuto decided to surrender his body to debauchery. He let go of all his inhibitions, and concentrated all his useless energy on his cock; satisfying all its cravings from months of letting it starve of a warm and moist environment with nothing but his hand as company. The ladies, </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes</span>
  </em>
  <span>, ladies, were more than happy to share his popsicle, alternating between licks and slits, while his jizz filled the rubber one after another. It was a marathon he never had before, they were like animals in heat, yearning for nothing but pure pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the light of dawn seeped inside the room, Hokuto found himself still awake. He didn’t bother with modesty as he walked naked to the window, gently parting the curtains to watch the rising sun. The sex was great, he was tired but sated, but despite all this, there was still a gaping hole in his heart. He isn’t happy, and he thinks he will never be. </span>
