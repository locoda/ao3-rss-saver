    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Moans and sighs filled the room as Hokuto watched a man and woman sort of squelching about in the middle of a circular bed. The man was clearly taking his sweet time, giving her slow and deep thrusts, while the woman seemed to want her release soon, as she started pushing back to meet his thrust.</p><p> </p><p>A lot of questions formed in Hokuto’s head. Are they really enjoying the sex with almost a dozen people around them? Is she really okay with being seen getting pumped by a stranger? Did they really think those half-masquerade masks adorned with glitters and feathers could really hide their identity? He sighed and crossed his arms. He is hopeless. What happened to the raging hormones of his youth? Why is he looking at these shagging individuals as though he was watching a documentary and not for what it was, a paraphilic interest, kink, fetish, or just sex? He was thinking too much when he should enjoy being in this real-life Stanley Kubrick movie. </p><p> </p><p>“This is pretty tame,” Juri said. Hokuto couldn’t see his face but he could tell from his voice that he was fighting a yawn. </p><p> </p><p>“Should we look for a threesome-foursome?” Juri asked. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed. “I appreciate that you brought me here to your exclusive club, but I think I need to go home-”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Juri snapped. “We’re going to fix your problem.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have a problem,” he muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever. I think there’s an S&amp;M somewhere, it’s quite popular so expect the room to be packed,” Juri finished and dragged him out of the room, Hokuto’s protests fell on deaf ears. They reached the 3rd-floor landing and were greeted with a very oily foursome on a marble floor. Hokuto had to bite his tongue to stop himself from saying that they should be careful, or they might slide off. They walked further and checked rooms covered with curtains only. Rooms with curtains meant that everyone was invited to watch, while those with locked doors meant exclusivity. They went deeper into the mansion, and Hokuto was starting to appreciate the house’s ritzy design, which he thought was such a shame because he didn’t think anyone would have time to admire it when they were mostly lost in rapture. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that…anal?” Juri whispered when they entered another room. Her back was turned against them and she was riding a cock on her ass. Her alabaster skin glistened with sweat while she moved with ease and urgency as though she wanted to climax so badly. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto decided to stare at the painting at the ceiling, and it was so absurd that the painting were a replica of a portion of Michaelangelo’s “The Last Judgment”. It was quite ironic that these people were doing the very thing that could have barred them from heaven. While he is also sinning because even though he made a resolve never to judge anyone he would see at this place, anal sex remained taboo for him. He couldn’t imagine doing it to someone, or worse, being the receiver. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh…they are both men,” Juri added with a degree of shock, which made Hokuto look back at the bed. </p><p> </p><p>From cowboy, they’ve shifted to doggy style. The “woman” on top earlier was clearly a man judging by his unmistakable erect penis that shook with each hard thrust. His legs were pretty hairy compared to his smooth torso, while sounds of ecstasy escaped his slightly parted lips. He glanced in their direction and despite a sequined blue mask covering half of his face, Hokuto could clearly see the invitation from his eyes. Those eyes were speaking to him, asking him to start touching himself and jump in. Hokuto shook his head as the man also broke eye contact, he definitely misread it. He wasn't being asked to join the fornication, his eyes must have looked like that because it was clouded with lust and psychedelics, or probably both. </p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t really my cup of tea, are you up for S&amp;M?” Juri asked, but he didn’t wait for a reply as he pulled him away from the room. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto made a quick glance back, and the man with the sequined blue mask was now lying on his back with his legs propped up. It was as though he was telling the angels and saints in the painting above that they could have heaven, and he’d rather go to hell and have his own kind of heaven.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“So the king is pressured to produce an heir, but he is also gay and very much in love with his general, so he asked his general to get the queen knocked up on his behalf.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded as Kouchi narrated the plot of his upcoming movie. “Eventually, the general, who I will be playing, falls for the queen, and the king orders my death.” </p><p> </p><p>“So you will fuck the queen?” Kouchi asked, his eyes gleaming with malice. It was like nothing mattered about the plot but those scenes, which Hokuto had some apprehension about. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes and the king will also fuck me,” he said, trying to appear nonchalant while his mind replayed to that scene he saw the other night underneath Michaelangelo’s “The Last Judgment”.</p><p> </p><p>“So you will be used a lot. Front and back.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded glumly. “A lot. You will see a lot of my ass.” </p><p> </p><p>Kouchi whistled. “Will there be frontal nudity? Not yours though,” he added quickly as he stopped the car in the driveway. </p><p> </p><p>“Just watched the movie,” Hokuto said and opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to fetch you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’ll take the taxi home, thank you for dropping me off,” he said and waved his best friend goodbye. </p><p> </p><p>His manager was already waiting for him at the lounge when he arrived at the studio and he couldn’t shake off the unease he started feeling when the director called to meet him again. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you think Shinji-san will replace me?" He asked with worry as they climbed the stairs. There was a lot of backlashes when he was announced to be one of the lead actors for “A Frozen Flower” remake, most backlash was about him not being a "proper actor". Most people still see him as an idol, and there were also growing concerns that such a serious-themed movie would be treated as an extension of his fans’ fantasies.</p><p> </p><p>"We already signed the contract," his manager replied, and Hokuto could see that even he wasn't that confident. “You also passed the audition fair and square, we both know that the agency didn’t want you to do this,” he added.</p><p> </p><p>"Right? Right!" He psyched himself up for this sudden meeting. The director didn’t say anything except asked for his free time, and he could only hope that was not getting sacked.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, Hokuto!" Shinji-san greeted him warmly. He didn't look like he was about to deliver bad news, but Hokuto still felt uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you spoken to Jun and Shun?" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shook his head. It would be his first time working with Sakurazawa Jun and Katori Shun and they haven’t really broken the ice. “Uhm, no. Is there something – ?”</p><p> </p><p>"Well, they already did this before you. Jun was the first one, Shun did this yesterday, and you're next. But of course, I don't want you to think that I'm hindering how you want to tackle this role, but I really think that this could better our movie."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded even though he still had no idea what he would be doing. "Sure, anything for the movie," he said with feigned enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>"Cool! If you permit it, you will be meeting an intimacy coordinator."</p><p> </p><p>"Intimacy coordinator?" He clarified. He thinks he heard the term before.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. It’s a fairly new profession in Hollywood whose job is to help the actors adjust and make their intimate scenes as comfortable as possible and to ensure that they are not being taken advantage of.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…I see,” Hokuto mumbled, and whether he admitted it or not, he might need one in real life. </p><p> </p><p>“I've already told him my vision about this movie, particularly on how I wanted those intimate scenes to be executed. Now, it's your turn to tell him any of your concerns about your intimate scenes, and he will be like your advocate or your negotiator. He won't exactly be directing you, that would still be my job, but he could help you and me to choreograph those scenes that won’t overstep the boundaries you’ve set." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could only nod in awe. He had no idea such a profession now existed, and he should have met this intimacy coordinator days ago instead of being dragged to that “house of sin.”</p><p> </p><p>“So do you wish to meet him?”</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, I'll meet him," Hokuto replied all too quickly. </p><p> </p><p>"That’s great then! I'll be leaving the two of you, feel free to tell him anything," Shinji-san said. He got up and knocked on the blue-colored door inside his office, it immediately opened to reveal one of the prettiest faces he had ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>Shinji-san’s guest looked at Hokuto, or more like studied him as soon as their eyes met. Hokuto thought there was something eerily familiar with those eyes, which should be weird because he doubted he would ever forget this man's face if they'd met before. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, this is Kyomoto Taiga, an intimacy coordinator. He just arrived a week ago from Los Angeles." </p><p> </p><p>They shook hands, Taiga's grip was strong but his hand was soft.</p><p> </p><p>"Hi, Kyomoto-san," he replied meekly.</p><p> </p><p>"Please, just call me Taiga."</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga."</p><p> </p><p>They sat across from each other as Shinji left his office and Hokuto realized that his heart had been racing. Suddenly, he was met with anxiety. How could he agree to this? How could he share anything intimate with a man he just met? </p><p> </p><p>"I know this feels odd," Taiga said.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a deep breath and willing himself to relax. He would only be telling Taiga his sex concerns in the movie and not about his real life. </p><p> </p><p>"Quite a bit," he admitted.</p><p> </p><p>"And I apologize that I might make you feel more uncomfortable…"</p><p> </p><p>"Uhm, what do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga opened the folder in his hand, and Hokuto thought that this meeting was starting to feel like a therapy session.</p><p> </p><p>"So…" Taiga started, his eyes moved to his crotch, which made Hokuto cross his legs and his action made Taiga smile, "will you let me enter your backdoor?" he asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Back…door? Whatever do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Will you let me fuck you?” </p><p>
