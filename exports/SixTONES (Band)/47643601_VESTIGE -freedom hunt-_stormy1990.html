      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The West Center had taken a huge risk by trying to find a way to get the Fallen on their side instead of hunting them down the way the Government ordered them to. Through which they eventually ended up in their biggest battle on two fronts. While the battle against the strongest Fallen group they had met so far seemed to be finally over, the Main Center had now laid eyes on them for keeping secrets from them.<br/>While Taisuke and the Fallen following him were now no danger to them anymore and Hokuto hoped that this chapter was finally over, it was a different story for Taiga as he still shared the instinct with Taisuke. An ongoing dangerous connection, which would force him to an emotional limit as his personal wishes didn’t match what the instinct wanted him to focus on.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Here we finally go wit the 3rd part of this series! One more to go after this!<br/>New characters and new chaos is on the way.</p><p>Hope you will enjoy reading^^/<br/>(as always be prepared for grammar/spelling mistakes and plot holes)</p></blockquote>

</p><p>The chaos was at its peak that was for sure. It had been a secret to all other Centers that the West Center was trying to rescue the Fallen and use their self-made Reserve serum to give them their access to emotions back, which finally ended the civil war between Vestige and Fallen. Yet it was questionable if the Government would accept it the same way as the West Center members did? Before they could even decide if and how to tell the Main Center about their discovery, things had gotten out of control after they had finally succeeded in bringing Taisuke’s group on their side.</p><p>A group of Elite-Vestige from the Main Center had suddenly taken control of the remaining Centers, making it impossible for the Fallen to return to the West Center. Shime’s group of non-center bound Vestige and Chasers made it out to the remaining Centers to gather information while Hokuto went to the West Center to see how the situation was. Yet it was a risky plan, also involving Reo, a Fallen that could easily be taken by the Elite-Vestige.</p><p>Yet hidden in the mountains there was still a way bigger fight going on. Taiga’s Fallen self was struggling with his instinct and while he tried his best to stay in control it wasn’t making the situation easier that Taisuke who shared that instinct was now on their side. Myuto tried to not be too protective, yet he also knew that Hokuto only chose to go to the Center, because he trusted Myuto with taking care of Taiga, yet he had already broken that promise without being aware of it.</p><p>There were secrets on all sides, a lot of questions that needed to be answered and with the appearance of someone Taiga and Myuto had thought all these years of as dead, things had gotten even more complicated. Now they had to find out why the leader of the Elite-Vestige was the orphan boy they had protected for years, Reia!</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>“So you cannot open it, is that what you want to say?” Konpi asked and raised an eyebrow after Hokuto had been trying to open the lab for quite some time now, but luck was on his side that he indeed had no clue how Kochi’s auto-lock worked.</p><p>“I fear if you want it to open, then you have to bring Kochi back. By the way, would you finally enlighten me about what is going on? As I told you everything was like always when we left, so what happened?”</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said coldly, before he waved at him to follow him down the corridor. “The lab can wait for later. They will bring Kochi back after the Main Center had a talk with him.”</p><p>“Who do you even mean with they? Who are you guys?” Hokuto finally lost his calm a bit and stopped, crossing his arms to his chest.</p><p>“We introduced ourselves earlier, remember?” Konpi replied in his annoying teasing manner.</p><p>“Then who are those others?” Hokuto asked as he turned to Konpi and the boy flicked his tongue, which annoyed Hokuto even more as he wasn’t in the mood to argue with two stupid teenagers.</p><p>“The Main Center put us in charge, so the Main Center is also under our order at the moment. You can’t tell us that you haven’t heard of us Elite-Vestige yet?” Katsuki replied instead and Hokuto had of course heard of them, but that didn’t make the situation any easier. A special generation of Vestige with extremely strong abilities and characteristics close to the Fallen and now their snappy attitude also made sense.</p><p>“And that means you have to listen to what we are saying and for now we want to talk to your little Fallen friend,” Konpi added with a lopsided smile.</p><p>“Fine, then go on,” Hokuto said and shrugged his shoulders. They had made sure to come up with a detailed fake story so that all of them had the same information from the moment Juri and Hokuto ‘fake’ departed from the Center. So no matter if they talked to Reo or Jesse and Shintaro, they should be fine, as long as none of them had mind reading abilities.</p><p>When they kept walking down the corridor, Hokuto dared to look up at one of the security cameras as he walked behind the others. He needed to know if he was right, but he didn’t know how to ask for a sign, yet he didn’t need to anymore as the camera moved just a tiny little bit to the left and that was all Hokuto had needed. Aran was in the lab! He was in full control of the Center’s security system and that made things a bit easier for Hokuto. Yet they had to find out if the Elite-Vestige had any special abilities and if it was a smart move to actually try to fight against them or if it was better to just wait. But somehow Hokuto was concerned about the situation at the Main Center so he needed to contact Shime and Noel as fast as he could.</p><p>***</p><p>“What the hell was that sudden rain,” Hagi complained as he made it down the ladder to the main floor of the hideout. His clothes were drained completely and he immediately threw his jacket and shirt into one of the corners, not wanting to take even more water into the hideout.</p><p>“Just wait until tomorrow, who knows if the weather will give us a heat stroke next or a blizzard,” Taiga complained as he took his long blonde strands into a ponytail to get the water out a bit.</p><p>Even before the war the weather had started to change and humanity had failed in keeping climate change under control. There was nothing like a four season weather anymore and it was never clear what kind of weather would follow next. Even the oceans were sometimes boiling up, then freezing cold. But if they wanted to get it under control they had to first end the war, not that they felt like it actually had an end.</p><p>“Damn, what I would give for a hot shower now,” Hagi complained, but Taisuke’s hideout didn’t have that kind of luxury. “I will grab some spare clothes. Yokoo told me where they keep them. Wait here so that we don’t flood the whole place.”</p><p>Taiga nodded gratefully as he remained in the entrance area. It had gotten colder with the heavy rain and even though Fallen and Vestige weren’t that affected by it, the time they had needed to make it back to the hideout from their patrol had made Taiga start shivering nevertheless. He put his hands up to his arms to rub a bit of warmth into them, but once more the water from his hair got in his way and he turned back to the entrance to get more water out of his hair so that it wouldn’t run down his face.</p><p>When something was thrown over his head he wanted to scold Hagi for throwing the dry clothes at him as they would just get wet like that, but when he turned around, a hand landed on the fabric and rubbed it over the boy’s hair. “Even Fallen can catch a cold and you are on the best way to it.”</p><p>It hadn’t been clothes, but a towel and it hadn’t been Hagi, but Taisuke. While everything told Taiga to step back, to take the other one’s hand away and use the towel by himself, he just couldn’t do it as his look went up to the older one’s face.</p><p>How could he look so calm? So gentle? They had tried to kill each other just days ago, their instincts battling each other too desperately to live alongside each other. Yet the instinct was making their lives even more complicated now or at least for Taiga, because Taisuke seemed to totally enjoy taking care of the other one. Not that it would stay that harmless and Taiga knew that of course, yet again he just didn’t move away.</p><p>“Hagi said he will bring spare clothes,” Taiga let out, not even knowing why his voice sounded so shy.</p><p>“Great, then you can get out of these,” Taisuke said and reached out for the other one’s jacket, pulling it down his shoulders and when Taisuke stepped a bit too close, Taiga finally made a step back and got out of the jacket by himself. Taisuke of course realized the change, but he couldn’t do more than show him an apologizing reaction. It was obvious how much he tried to not let things escalate again like the other night, but who were they kidding? It was impossible.</p><p>“Here, take the towel. You should definitely get out of that shirt,” Taisuke said and held the towel towards him. Taiga didn’t take it right away and finally got rid of his shirt for now. As he reached out to grab the towel, his hand landed half on Taisuke’s and once more he felt how he behaved so damn stupid. Instead of taking the towel, he grabbed the other one’s hand and Taisuke dared to step closer again and lifted the towel up to the boy’s hair once more with a soft touch.</p><p>The sound of a door opening right behind Taisuke made Taiga almost jump to the back and Taisuke turned towards the person stepping out.</p><p>“Oh, finally awake? How are you feeling?” Taisuke somehow was able to bring out.</p><p>Juri’s look turned from slightly disorientated to fully confused in seconds. He had no idea where he was or how the battle had ended, but the picture in front of him seemed even more confusing to him. Slowly Taisuke took down the towel he somehow still held awkwardly in the air, while Taiga crossed his arms to his exposed upper body with a weird hawk.</p><p>“Hey Taiga, I could only- oh, Juri! And- ehm what is going on here?” Hagi asked, obviously as confused as Juri, but also a bit scolding as he of course had been told to have an eye on Taiga, yet it seemed like Taisuke always showed up when they weren’t around for a second.</p><p>“Guys, give me a break,” Juri complained, rubbing his temples, obviously still in pain, which was understandable after all the impacts he had taken in. “I will go back to my room until you solve whatever this is and then can someone please explain to me what happened? And I mean the important stuff, thanks.”</p><p>With a hand movement at Taiga and Taisuke when talking about ‘this’, Juri went back straight to his room and closed the door as if nothing had happened. Meanwhile Hagi finally walked up to Taiga and pressed some clothes against his chest. He had changed already and gave Taisuke a look over his shoulder now.</p><p>“Right, I will tell the others that Juri woke up,” Taisuke said and when he entered the lab a heavy silence lay between Hagi and Taiga.</p><p>“Do I need to worry?” Hagi asked, but instead of feeling guilty, there was anger rising inside Taiga. He grabbed the shirt with an annoyed click of his tongue, leaving Hagi even more speechless.</p><p>“No you don’t and Myuto also doesn’t have to,” Taiga replied, which meant as much as no need to even tell Myuto. “I will talk to Juri.”</p><p>Without giving Hagi the chance to reply, Taiga headed towards the boy’s room, but he also felt sorry, because his own anger wasn’t Hagi’s fault. It was all because of the instinct. Now that it didn’t have to fight anymore, it just put up a wall to protect his and Taisuke’s emotions and it was as difficult to control as the urge to rip the other one apart.</p><p>***</p><p>“Why do you waste your time? If you want to know anything, look at that oh so awesome Vestige behind you. His mind reading ability will definitely tell you everything you need to know.”</p><p>Reo’s snappy attitude had even Hokuto taken aback as he behaved even more fiercely than he had back when he was indeed still their enemy. But it was obvious that even for Reo it was easier to play it this way than in his usual fun way.</p><p>“Did you use your mind reading on him already?” Katsuki asked and Hokuto nodded. He still leaned back at the metal door of their special observation room, for the first time really used on a Fallen, not that Reo would try to break out of it. Which would also not be that simple, because even with the lab shut down, the special observation room had a special security system as a backup which could be used right from the outside of the room. But that didn’t mean that Aran couldn’t take control of the room if he wanted to.</p><p>Hokuto had already told them the fake story about how they had captured him with his mind control and that he needed to be chained down, because of his illusion ability. Now exactly that had happened and Reo played with the chains, which were connected to two metal hooks in the ground, while Katsuki was standing in front of his chair and Konpi was sitting on one of the tables with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“We found out where their hideout is located, but when Juri went over to check on it, they had already abandoned it.”</p><p>“That reminds me, where is your transmitter?” Katsuki asked, but then Reo let out an annoyed sound and threw his head to the back.</p><p>“You know I feel like you interrogate him more than me. Would you mind and get lost if you want to waste his time instead?”</p><p>This time Konpi got up from the table and Hokuto bit the inside of his cheek when the boy lifted his leg and gave Reo a harsh kick to the stomach and left his leg up on the other one’s upper body as he leant down to him. Reo gave him a death glare and yanked on the chains, but picking a fight was no option for him.</p><p>“But like this it’s more fun,” Konpi said and pulled something out of his pocket and while Reo had no clue what it was, Hokuto’s eyes grew wide as he stepped away from the door.</p><p>“Why do you have that?” Hokuto asked, his voice not as steady as he wanted it to be.</p><p>“We have access to almost everything as Elite-Vestige and as we knew that you are in this Center we made sure to bring it,” Konpi said as he used unnecessary force to push himself away from Reo resulting with another angry glare from the Fallen.</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter, right?” Konpi asked, as he waved the remote control in front of Hokuto’s face. “We heard a lot of stories about you. But as calm as you are I am sure we are not talking to your Fallen self, right?”</p><p>Of course the Main Center had been still kept in the dark about Hokuto’s and Taiga’s transitions as well as all the other Fallen related news, yet this was the worst they could have brought with them. Because what if the remote suddenly worked? Now he was a Vestige, it was going to work, right? They would find out!</p><p>Hokuto’s panic got the best of him and he remained completely silent, which made Katsuki walk up to him with a skeptical look.</p><p>“We heard that in fights your Fallen self would take over, but you captured Reo without it?”</p><p>That question made Reo laugh so that they turned back to him, giving Hokuto a moment to get himself back together.</p><p>“You forget that Hokuto’s Fallen self can use his abilities as well. He is an asshole I can tell you that, but helping you guys out just to mock us, is something he also loves doing. He feels superior.”</p><p>“I would say he is, because now you are here and he is still with Hokuto,” Konpi mocked the other one.</p><p>“Is he?” Katsuki asked as he turned back to Hokuto, but this time the other one had gotten his act up again.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I was able to get rid of him, but unfortunately the Main Center didn’t come up with something until now and Kochi didn’t either, so I fear you have to live with the chance that he will show up if you go on my nerves too much.”</p><p>Konpi laughed on that, already looking forward to actually facing the Fallen self not knowing that for that he would need to meet Taiga now. “What a shame, then this thing is just a useless toy this time.”</p><p>Even though Konpi had said so, his finger went right to one of the buttons on it and Hokuto froze, ready to experience severe pain, yet nothing happened…</p><p>“Boring,” Konpi said as he put the remote back into his pocket.</p><p>“Do Elite-Vestige not have a microchip or why do you think it’s ok to just ‘try out’ if mine works?” Hokuto asked, trying to calm down his racing heartbeat.</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said as he gave Reo another look. “For now I think we won’t get anything out of him, so let’s discuss how we proceed from here. We need to report to the Main Center.”</p><p>Hokuto was grateful for the break he would get, but he also wanted to know why the remote wasn’t working, not that it was his priority to find out. For now they had to make a plan, which was difficult with them not being able to talk to each other. But maybe Aran could somehow help them to get Katsuki and Konpi out of the way long enough to come up with something. But for now Hokuto needed to know more about them and their special abilities before he could make any kind of plan.</p><p>***</p><p>"Okay, then I guess I should wait just a bit longer until I head back too," Juri concluded after getting a brief explanation from Taiga and of course the boy had left out all the stuff about Taisuke. Now they were in the lab with Myuto, Kentaro, Senga and Yokoo. But of course Juri could feel Myuto's eyes on Taiga.</p><p>"Yes, I think we should wait until we get a reply from Hokuto. As long as we don't know what is going on at the West Center I don't think you should head there too."</p><p>Myuto was right, but Juri was also feeling restless. He had gotten all the fake stories from the others, but for now he wanted to rest some more.</p><p>"Give me until the morning and I'll help you with your patrols, okay?" Juri said and of course everyone agreed and Juri excused himself for now.</p><p>"Guess we should also get ready. The others should be back soon," Kentaro said and it was obvious that all he wanted to do was to actually get out and find his brother. It was getting complicated to have Kentaro on a team without him, not that anyone could blame him.</p><p>"Taiga and I will go," Myuto announced on which Kentaro pouted, but when Hagi told him that they would go for the next one, Taiga knew that this was no random patrol and he sighed but headed to the door.</p><p>They walked in silence for quite a while until they had left the hideout behind them and at a rocky open surface Taiga finally stopped.</p><p>"Hagi told you, didn't he?"</p><p>Of course he had, Myuto was their leader and they were all worried for Taiga.</p><p>"I just want to remind you of our promise to Hokuto. You know that at some point you'll have to let Taiga take over again and he'll definitely ask me to dig out those memories," Myuto explained, but it was obvious that he also didn't want to do so, yet he wouldn't refuse if Taiga asked him. He had taken the dangerous step of letting his Fallen self take over for so long. He deserved to know what had happened, yet it was clear that the aftermath of knowing was going to be heavy.</p><p>"At least they won't be his memories."</p><p>The Fallen self had whispered the words ahead into the forest, but of course Myuto had heard him and when he let out a long breath he could see the breath forming a cloud in the air. It had gotten extremely cold, snow definitely about to fall.</p><p>"Look, I know that for Taiga's sake I have to try hard as well to not give him even worse memories and trust me when I tell you I'm trying."</p><p>Of course he had already failed once, but while it still remained a secret, Myuto obviously had caught up to the fact that something had happened. Yet Myuto didn't seem angry. His look was calm, but the worry for Taiga was obvious.</p><p>"I guess we all have to thank you for what you've done in the end, no matter if you or the instinct decide to do some harmful things in between."</p><p>The snort Taiga let out on hearing that made Myuto crack a smile this time. But he meant what he had said. The Fallen self could have betrayed them at all times, but for Taiga's sake he hadn’t done so.</p><p>"You had offered me a place back then," Taiga said as he looked up into the sky. "At that time I really wanted that place. I wanted my own life and I would have sacrificed Hokuto to get it."</p><p>"But not Taiga," Myuto concluded as he walked away from the other one with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>"Now I'm offered another place,” Taiga said his look a bit absentminded. "But exactly because of this connection I understand now what I would take away from Taiga to get my own happiness."</p><p>It was weird to hear him talk like this, because even though he had gone through a lot of changes through the instinct and two serums, in the end even the Reverse serum wouldn’t turn him as he was only a mindset and his body belonged to Taiga. That was luckily also why he had been able to put up an act with Taisuke before as the original Fallen serum didn’t really had any effect on him as he had always been a full Fallen and only the blood connection had powered up his instinct and had made staying in control a challenge.</p><p>"Then show me how determined you are," Myuto said as he had walked in front of Taiga at some distance and turned towards him with a challenging smile. "Show me what that instinct is capable of."</p><p>The invitation for a fight came as a surprise to Taiga and for a moment he looked startled until he also formed a brief smile and started moving his arms and neck with an exciting expression. "All injuries go on you. I won't hold back."</p><p>"I didn't ask you to," Myuto replied with another teasing smile before they both dashed to the front.</p><p>Being trapped all together in the hideout had caused them all a lot of growing tension so this fight was something they definitely needed. It was also a chance for Taiga to give his instinct a moment of release and try and keep his walls up as best as he could afterwards.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>There was not a single second in which Hokuto wasn't under supervision of one of the Elite Vestige. But while Katsuki had obviously talked to Jesse and Shintaro as well, it didn't seem like they had said anything out of the ordinary. Yet they were still quite suspicious especially because they weren't able to enter the lab.</p><p>"Did the Main Center contact you about Kochi?" Hokuto asked again as he was sitting in the common room with Konpi, a few Chasers scattered around the room, but it was obvious that they didn't like the presence of the Elite Vestige either.</p><p>"And again I'll tell you that this is none of your business," Konpi replied while he was lying with his upper body on the table, obviously not happy about playing babysitter for Hokuto.</p><p>"Kochi is the leader of the West Center, you took him without giving us further information about the reason, neither did you contact us or let him contact us. So yes this is my business," Hokuto let out a bit snappier this time.</p><p>Konpi sat up and gave him a warning look, but he wouldn't get provoked enough to spill any secrets. When Katsuki finally came back after he had a talk with Reo again, the boy's mood seemed to brighten up.</p><p>"Your turn to watch him," Konpi chirped and jumped up, but Katsuki stopped him before he could leave the room.</p><p>"I need you to stay for a bit longer."</p><p>Katsuki's request made a weird smile appear on the boy's lips before he turned back to Hokuto. "Great, then get up."</p><p>"What are you up to this time?" Hokuto asked, yet Konpi rolled his eyes as he stepped closer to the Vestige and slammed his foot on the bench he was sitting on. Some Chasers tensed on the boy’s behavior, but they knew that interfering would make things even worse. "You'll see soon enough, now stop asking unnecessary questions and get up."</p><p>Hokuto did how he was told, but he looked over to Jesse and Shintaro before they left the room. Both boys nodded at him, but they couldn't do much at the moment either. The Chasers weren't under strict supervision, but if they did something suspicious it could end in a disaster.</p><p>"Which one is your room?" Katsuki asked as they made it to the second floor and now Hokuto finally got worried.</p><p>"It doesn't matter if you lie, any room will do," Konpi added.</p><p>Hokuto showed them his room, but there was nothing they could actually find in here.</p><p>"Why are there Chaser clothes in your room?" Katsuki asked as he randomly picked up some clothes. Right, Taiga usually slept in his room most of the time so a lot of clothes had ended up in here as well.</p><p>When Hokuto didn't reply, Konpi got ready to threaten him once more, but Katsuki stopped him, this topic luckily not of his concern for now.</p><p>"We talked to everyone in this Center and we got either no information or the same useless information," Katsuki explained.</p><p>"So? I already told you what I know," Hokuto replied, but had his eyes on Konpi who kept walking around him.</p><p>"And to find out if any of you is lying we need you to talk to everyone."</p><p>This time Katsuki's words didn't make much sense to him until Konpi stopped right next to him with the same excited look as before.</p><p>"With the difference that I will be going instead of you."</p><p>Hokuto reacted intuitively and jumped back before Konpi could reach out for him, but Katsuki was blocking the door.</p><p>"As if I let you use your abilities on me."</p><p>"We will get Konpi to use his mind switch if you want to or not. So it depends on if you want it the hard way or the easy one?" Katsuki told him.</p><p>"Mind switch? So you can use my body, but put your own mind in it?"</p><p>"Exactly," Konpi said and walked slowly over to Hokuto once more. "I can only control your body for a certain amount of time and my body will be useless for that time, but I can take back all the memories from the time I used your body."</p><p>Which meant he didn't possess any kind reading ability, which was good to know. Now he had to decide though if he wanted to put up a fight or not. Would the others notice? Or would they spill their secrets to Konpi?</p><p>When the boy tried to jump at him once more Hokuto attacked for the first time, but before he could use any of his abilities he was thrown to the back, right into the wall. But the movement hadn't come from Konpi.</p><p>With a groan Hokuto got up again and gave Katsuki an annoyed look. The boy had barely moved. He had only lifted his hand.</p><p>"Telekinesis?"</p><p>"Exactly," Katsuki replied. "So you better choose wisely if you want to fight us."</p><p>Not fighting would make it more believable that they had no secrets, but if he fought…</p><p>"Even if I don't fight you, I cannot promise you that my Fallen self will stay silent," Hokuto warned them of a threat not existing anymore.</p><p>"That's fine with me. I want to meet him anyway," Konpi said clearly excited, but Hokuto backed off to the corner once more yet he knew that they weren't going to stop even if they had to face his Fallen self.</p><p>"Last chance," Katsuki said and lifted his hand, but this time Hokuto didn't run when Konpi got closer to him. He had to believe in the others to somehow find out that something was off. Fighting them now wouldn't make much sense and he was sure that the outcome was going to be the same.</p><p>"Oh, done running away? How boring," Konpi complained as Hokuto gave him an annoyed look, but didn't back off when the boy reached out for his face.</p><p>After a few seconds Katsuki walked over to them and the same as with mind controlling, Hokuto realized how he was losing control of his own thoughts, but he somehow still stayed in the back of his own mind. Maybe it was normal for this ability or it was because he had trained with Myuto and Taiga for similar abilities before.</p><p>Konpi collapsed to the back the next moment and Katsuki lifted him on the bed before he turned back to Hokuto.</p><p>"Did it work?" Katsuki asked, facing Hokuto.</p><p>"When did it not work?" Konpi asked with Hokuto's voice yet Hokuto could still follow their conversation. Maybe he could even kick him out if necessary? After all, he was able to do it with mind control.</p><p>"Hokuto is special after all, the Fallen self could interfere, so stay focused."</p><p>"Fine, then let's go," Konpi said and while he left the room, Katsuki stayed behind. Right, if they wanted someone to spill secrets there was no chance to get them if Katsuki was with him.</p><p>He made his way down to the main floor, but most Chasers had moved to the training room instead of the common area. Konpi aimed for Shintaro and Jesse, the two totally confused when Hokuto walked up to them.</p><p>"Where are the Elite-Vestige?" Shintaro asked, already on high alert.</p><p>"I was able to keep them busy with something else. Any updates?"</p><p>The question was well asked, because even though they didn't know about Hokuto and the others lying or not, the question could get interpreted in a lot of ways.</p><p>"Nothing so far," Jesse said and Hokuto cursed in his mind. They hadn't realized at all.</p><p>"But there is something about Reo. You remember when you said there was that mind block? I think we found a solution to get into that part," Shintaro said and while Konpi immediately asked what they had found out, Hokuto was left confused. What mind block? What was going on?</p><p>"You want to try?" Jesse asked after an explanation that could have never been made up by Jesse himself.</p><p>"But you should get at least one of the Elite Vestige. I don't want to end up in trouble," Shintaro added and Konpi actually agreed.</p><p>He got Katsuki and left Konpi in his room while they told Shintaro and Jesse to wait.</p><p>"They seriously need to clean this Center more often," Konpi complained as he lifted his hand to the air as a bit of dusk seemed to have risen from the floor in front of the special observation room.</p><p>"You can't use his special abilities, so we need to figure out what to do now," Katsuki said as they stopped in front of Reo's room.</p><p>"I'll just leave his mind at some point and you can force him to do that mind reading part the way the Chasers just said."</p><p>Katsuki agreed and entered the room first, Reo sitting silently on his chair with his head down.</p><p>"Did we get a sand storm or what?" Konpi complained once more and that was when it clicked.</p><p>Hokuto was still at the door while Katsuki had walked up to Reo and it was now or never. Hokuto put all his remaining strength into kicking Konpi out of his mind and the boy gasped, leaning to the front.</p><p>Katsuki on the other hand had reached out for Reo, but on the touch the illusion vanished and he swirled around with wide eyes.</p><p>Hokuto feared he wouldn't have enough time, but then he was grabbed by the back of his shirt and pulled out of the room while Reo slammed the door shut from the outside, leaving Katsuki trapped inside.</p><p>Hokuto kept fighting off Konpi and finally the boy's mind switch was gone, leaving Hokuto gasping for air.</p><p>"Reo? How? What is going on?" Hokuto asked and the boy gave him a bright smile and pointed up at the camera.</p><p>"You're welcome," Aran was heard, but not from the security system, but from right behind him.</p><p>"Konpi, he is still-"</p><p>"No he is not," Aran interrupted Hokuto as he was about to panic. "When you left your room without them I knew that something was off so I contacted the Chasers and gave them a plan on how to lure you two into this room while I unlocked Reo's room so that he could get out. The Chasers took care of Konpi the moment you two came to this room."</p><p>That explained at least why Shintaro and Jesse talked about something Hokuto had never heard about.</p><p>"I'll head over to help them. After all, it's an Elite-Vestige. We need to make sure to keep them separated and tied up," Reo offered and headed down the corridor.</p><p>"But they will contact the Main Center," Hokuto said as he got up, but once more Aran shook his head.</p><p>"I unplugged the antennas for now. They will realize that too, but not as fast. But you need to go out to the truck and contact the others, right?"</p><p>"How do you know all that?” Hokuto asked.</p><p>“Let’s say Kochi had made up a plan the moment you left the Center. He had already seen this outcome with the way we hid all the information from the Main Center for this long so he guessed that you would come up with a plan to come back here somehow.”</p><p>“Anyway, thank you. Without you we would have been screwed,” Hokuto thanked him. “But now we have to decide what to do next. I need to hear back from Shime and Noel if they found Kochi or not.”</p><p>***</p><p>“So you know the leader of the Elite Vestige?” Juri asked as he had finally recovered enough to have longer talks without getting a headache. Taiga and Myuto both nodded, but then Juri turned to Taiga. “How come you know him? You have not been with Taiga before this year.”</p><p>“I still have access to all his memories since we switched the first time, so I know Reia as well.”</p><p>“And he is one of the orphans you took care of, right? Are any of the other Elite Vestige also kids you know?”</p><p>Myuto shook his head as he lifted up the photos the others had sent them from the Vestige of the Centers. “No, these boys we don’t know. But it could be that the others are still part of the Main Center or-”</p><p>“That they died in their endless tests to create the Elite-Vestige,” Taiga said out loud what Myuto didn’t want to say. “After all they vanished when Myuto and others were still turned into Fallen. So they kept this research behind closed doors for years. Who knows how many people have died over that time.”</p><p>In a moment of uncomfortable silence the contact device on Miyata’s desk kicked in. The other Fallen were not in the lab, but they had all learned by now how to use the transmitter and Taiga hurried to put the signal through.</p><p>“Hey, sorry for the wait.”</p><p>“Hokuto! Are you guys okay?” Taiga was confused about his own worried voice as were Myuto and Juri obviously, but no matter if Taiga was not awake at the moment, the worry about Hokuto was a natural part even for the Fallen self.</p><p>“We had some trouble, but we kind of solved it for now. Aran helped us to overpower the Elite-Vestige and they are grounded for now, but the Main Center will soon realize so we have to act fast. Did Shime find Kochi?”</p><p>There was so much information to exchange, but for now Myuto felt calmer just by hearing that Aran was with them and safe.</p><p>“No, unfortunately not,” Myuto explained. “They have access to almost all parts of the Main Center, but they didn’t find him yet.”</p><p>“That is unfortunately what I thought.”</p><p>“What is on your mind?” Taiga asked.</p><p>“I doubt they just brought him in for a normal questioning. They have realized that we were doing something behind their backs. The Elite-Vestige even brought my remote just to test if my Fallen self was still with me.”</p><p>“What?” Juri let out, completely in shock about hearing that and his hand immediately went up to the back of his neck.</p><p>“Don’t worry it didn’t work, I am not sure why, but at least they couldn’t prove that my Fallen self wasn’t with me anymore.”</p><p>“Then what do we do?” Myuto asked, but they all remained silent for a moment.</p><p>“I have an idea, but it will be super reckless, yet it’s the only plan I can think of,” Hokuto finally said. “I thought a lot about something like we pulled off here at the West Center, but it might be too risky and I don’t want to put anyone else in the same danger I put Reo in.”</p><p>“So you want us to directly attack?” Myuto said, as that would give them the chance to use their full power on the Main Center.</p><p>“I know it sounds reckless, but we already have two Elite-Vestige captive, so I would say we should send some back up for the others to keep the Elite-Vestige away from the Main Center while we attack and use the chaos to get information about Kochi’s whereabouts. If Shime’s information are correct then only Reia is at the Main Center with other Vestige and soldiers right now.”</p><p>“Let me go in first,” Juri suggested, but everyone gave him a skeptical look. “They are waiting for me to return in the first place and I can pretend that I had been at the West Center first and make them believe that there is a problem with the Antenna and that is why they can’t contact their Elite-Vestige while I can also try and find out more about Kochi without being too suspicious. After all, Shime can’t just ask around for Kochi. Officially he shouldn’t even know that he is there.”</p><p>“But what about me?” Taiga asked as he was with Juri in their fake story.</p><p>“I can just say you stayed at the West Center to help out there.”</p><p>“Or we can also say you died in a fight against us if you want it more dramatic?” Myuto’s words had Taiga hit him against the shoulder and the other one chuckled, but then his look turned serious again.</p><p>“So we need to form teams and make a plan on how to proceed in an emergency,” Myuto explained and he looked at Juri who nodded.</p><p>“If you can’t contact me anymore then you know that they are definitely up to something. I am willing to take the risk and it might be easier to find out their motives like this in the first place. It’s not like we did anything bad with the serum, but Kochi was worried about telling them and I think he just got proven right.”</p><p>“Hokuto, we will make a plan and count how many people we have per team and contact you again,” Taiga promised and Hokuto told them to hurry and contact him before nightfall.</p><p>“So if our information are right, then there is one Elite-Vestige at all remaining Centers, but we only have one or two Chasers or Vestige from Shime’s team at each Center. Do we have enough people to pull this off?” Myuto asked a bit skeptical.</p><p>“Count us in.”</p><p>Everyone turned towards the door where Taisuke was leaning against the doorframe. “We owe you a lot so there is no way we will stay behind and just watch you run into your doom.”</p><p>“Thanks, the more people, the better,” Juri thanked the Fallen. “Then we have seven members from Taisuke’s group, five from Myuto’s group, Taiga and me.”</p><p>“Nika and I will head to the East Center,” Kentaro was heard behind Taisuke and the boy didn’t seem as if anyone could argue about that decision.</p><p>“We have enough people to send one or two more Fallen with you,” Myuto offered, but Kentaro shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t need even more people in my way. I will tell Nika. Let me know when you are ready to leave.”</p><p>Myuto shook his head at the other one as he left without even listening to the whole plan.</p><p>“Well, he is too stubborn to argue with anyway,” Taiga said and let him be.</p><p>“And if he gets his ass beaten then he can still ask for help,” Myuto added, discussing the remaining teams for now so that they could come up with a plan as soon as possible, not that they knew what kind of chaos they were bringing themselves into in the first place.</p><p>***</p><p>“That’s a ridiculous plan,” Aran complained after Hokuto had told everyone in the West Center what they were going to do, but of course no one was supportive of Juri running right into the lion cage.</p><p>“Kochi is no Vestige, there is no way he can get out of there by himself and over all these years it’s pretty clear to us that he always tried things different from the Government. You all know that,” Hokuto said and faced the Chasers who had gathered in the training room. “You stayed even after I told you about my Fallen self, you stayed when Taiga became a Fallen and you even stayed when we brought Myuto and the others into our Center. And you did it all because you believed in Kochi, so let me ask you, do you want him to take all the blame for what we have decided as well to do?”</p><p>Shintaro was the one to step to the front on Hokuto’s words. “It’s not that I don’t agree with the main plan,” Shintaro started. “I don’t agree with the part where we sit here and don’t beat the shit out of those Government bastards ourselves.”</p><p>The round of agreement going through the rows of Chasers made Hokuto smile while Aran rolled his eyes. “Fine, but I warn you, if anyone dares to do something that is not part of the plan I am here to beat your ass in Kochi’s name.”</p><p>“Aran could definitely take over for Kochi,” Jesse joked.</p><p>“Reo will stay here to make sure Konpi and Katsuki are under control and when Hagi arrives I will head to the Main Center,” Hokuto explained. “I know you don’t like staying back, but you have two Elite-Vestige here and don’t forget that they are extremely dangerous and if you let your guard down the West Center will be in trouble as well and we will need this place to retreat to in case things don’t go as planned.”</p><p>“Don’t worry we will make sure that no one can get even close to our Center,” Shintaro almost yelled. “I can’t wait to kick those two Vestige in their Elite ass and with that out of this Center for good.”</p><p>“Make sure to stay in contact with the others, I will be in the lab,” Aran said towards Hokuto.</p><p>“Do you think you can somehow enter their system?” Hokuto asked after Aran had said he would try to hack into their system over a non-trackable device he had used in Myuto’s hideout before.</p><p>“Maybe, but if they find out then Kochi and Juri are in danger so I need to be really careful.”</p><p>They all had to be careful, but also fast, because Hokuto just couldn’t shake off that weird feeling about the Government suddenly moving out to all Centers this aggressively because of unrelated reasons to the West Center as well.</p>
