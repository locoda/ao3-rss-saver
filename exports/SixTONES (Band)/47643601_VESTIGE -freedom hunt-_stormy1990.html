      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The West Center had taken a huge risk by trying to find a way to get the Fallen on their side instead of hunting them down the way the Government ordered them to. Through which they eventually ended up in their biggest battle on two fronts. While the battle against the strongest Fallen group they had met so far seemed to be finally over, the Main Center had now laid eyes on them for keeping secrets from them.<br/>While Taisuke and the Fallen following him were now no danger to them anymore and Hokuto hoped that this chapter was finally over, it was a different story for Taiga as he still shared the instinct with Taisuke. An ongoing dangerous connection, which would force him to an emotional limit as his personal wishes didn’t match what the instinct wanted him to focus on.</p></blockquote>

</p><p>The chaos was at its peak that was for sure. It had been a secret to all other Centers that the West Center was trying to rescue the Fallen and use their self-made Reserve serum to give them their access to emotions back, which finally ended the civil war between Vestige and Fallen. Yet it was questionable if the Government would accept it the same way as the West Center members did? Before they could even decide if and how to tell the Main Center about their discovery, things had gotten out of control after they had finally succeeded in bringing Taisuke’s group on their side.</p><p>A group of Elite-Vestige from the Main Center had suddenly taken control of the remaining Centers, making it impossible for the Fallen to return to the West Center. Shime’s group of non-center bound Vestige and Chasers made it out to the remaining Centers to gather information while Hokuto went to the West Center to see how the situation was. Yet it was a risky plan, also involving Reo, a Fallen that could easily be taken by the Elite-Vestige.</p><p>Yet hidden in the mountains there was still a way bigger fight going on. Taiga’s Fallen self was struggling with his instinct and while he tried his best to stay in control it wasn’t making the situation easier that Taisuke who shared that instinct was now on their side. Myuto tried to not be too protective, yet he also knew that Hokuto only chose to go to the Center, because he trusted Myuto with taking care of Taiga, yet he had already broken that promise without being aware of it.</p><p>There were secrets on all sides, a lot of questions that needed to be answered and with the appearance of someone Taiga and Myuto had thought all these years of as dead, things had gotten even more complicated. Now they had to find out why the leader of the Elite-Vestige was the orphan boy they had protected for years, Reia!</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>“So you cannot open it, is that what you want to say?” Konpi asked and raised an eyebrow after Hokuto had been trying to open the lab for quite some time now, but luck was on his side that he indeed had no clue how Kochi’s auto-lock worked.</p><p>“I fear if you want it to open, then you have to bring Kochi back. By the way, would you finally enlighten me about what is going on? As I told you everything was like always when we left, so what happened?”</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said coldly, before he waved at him to follow him down the corridor. “The lab can wait for later. They will bring Kochi back after the Main Center had a talk with him.”</p><p>“Who do you even mean with they? Who are you guys?” Hokuto finally lost his calm a bit and stopped, crossing his arms to his chest.</p><p>“We introduced ourselves earlier, remember?” Konpi replied in his annoying teasing manner.</p><p>“Then who are those others?” Hokuto asked as he turned to Konpi and the boy flicked his tongue, which annoyed Hokuto even more as he wasn’t in the mood to argue with two stupid teenagers.</p><p>“The Main Center put us in charge, so the Main Center is also under our order at the moment. You can’t tell us that you haven’t heard of us Elite-Vestige yet?” Katsuki replied instead and Hokuto had of course heard of them, but that didn’t make the situation any easier. A special generation of Vestige with extremely strong abilities and characteristics close to the Fallen and now their snappy attitude also made sense.</p><p>“And that means you have to listen to what we are saying and for now we want to talk to your little Fallen friend,” Konpi added with a lopsided smile.</p><p>“Fine, then go on,” Hokuto said and shrugged his shoulders. They had made sure to come up with a detailed fake story so that all of them had the same information from the moment Juri and Hokuto ‘fake’ departed from the Center. So no matter if they talked to Reo or Jesse and Shintaro, they should be fine, as long as none of them had mind reading abilities.</p><p>When they kept walking down the corridor, Hokuto dared to look up at one of the security cameras as he walked behind the others. He needed to know if he was right, but he didn’t know how to ask for a sign, yet he didn’t need to anymore as the camera moved just a tiny little bit to the left and that was all Hokuto had needed. Aran was in the lab! He was in full control of the Center’s security system and that made things a bit easier for Hokuto. Yet they had to find out if the Elite-Vestige had any special abilities and if it was a smart move to actually try to fight against them or if it was better to just wait. But somehow Hokuto was concerned about the situation at the Main Center so he needed to contact Shime and Noel as fast as he could.</p><p>***</p><p>“What the hell was that sudden rain,” Hagi complained as he made it down the ladder to the main floor of the hideout. His clothes were drained completely and he immediately threw his jacket and shirt into one of the corners, not wanting to take even more water into the hideout.</p><p>“Just wait until tomorrow, who knows if the weather will give us a heat stroke next or a blizzard,” Taiga complained as he took his long blonde strands into a ponytail to get the water out a bit.</p><p>Even before the war the weather had started to change and humanity had failed in keeping climate change under control. There was nothing like a four season weather anymore and it was never clear what kind of weather would follow next. Even the oceans were sometimes boiling up, then freezing cold. But if they wanted to get it under control they had to first end the war, not that they felt like it actually had an end.</p><p>“Damn, what I would give for a hot shower now,” Hagi complained, but Taisuke’s hideout didn’t have that kind of luxury. “I will grab some spare clothes. Yokoo told me where they keep them. Wait here so that we don’t flood the whole place.”</p><p>Taiga nodded gratefully as he remained in the entrance area. It had gotten colder with the heavy rain and even though Fallen and Vestige weren’t that affected by it, the time they had needed to make it back to the hideout from their patrol had made Taiga start shivering nevertheless. He put his hands up to his arms to rub a bit of warmth into them, but once more the water from his hair got in his way and he turned back to the entrance to get more water out of his hair so that it wouldn’t run down his face.</p><p>When something was thrown over his head he wanted to scold Hagi for throwing the dry clothes at him as they would just get wet like that, but when he turned around, a hand landed on the fabric and rubbed it over the boy’s hair. “Even Fallen can catch a cold and you are on the best way to it.”</p><p>It hadn’t been clothes, but a towel and it hadn’t been Hagi, but Taisuke. While everything told Taiga to step back, to take the other one’s hand away and use the towel by himself, he just couldn’t do it as his look went up to the older one’s face.</p><p>How could he look so calm? So gentle? They had tried to kill each other just days ago, their instincts battling each other too desperately to live alongside each other. Yet the instinct was making their lives even more complicated now or at least for Taiga, because Taisuke seemed to totally enjoy taking care of the other one. Not that it would stay that harmless and Taiga knew that of course, yet again he just didn’t move away.</p><p>“Hagi said he will bring spare clothes,” Taiga let out, not even knowing why his voice sounded so shy.</p><p>“Great, then you can get out of these,” Taisuke said and reached out for the other one’s jacket, pulling it down his shoulders and when Taisuke stepped a bit too close, Taiga finally made a step back and got out of the jacket by himself. Taisuke of course realized the change, but he couldn’t do more than show him an apologizing reaction. It was obvious how much he tried to not let things escalate again like the other night, but who were they kidding? It was impossible.</p><p>“Here, take the towel. You should definitely get out of that shirt,” Taisuke said and held the towel towards him. Taiga didn’t take it right away and finally got rid of his shirt for now. As he reached out to grab the towel, his hand landed half on Taisuke’s and once more he felt how he behaved so damn stupid. Instead of taking the towel, he grabbed the other one’s hand and Taisuke dared to step closer again and lifted the towel up to the boy’s hair once more with a soft touch.</p><p>The sound of a door opening right behind Taisuke made Taiga almost jump to the back and Taisuke turned towards the person stepping out.</p><p>“Oh, finally awake? How are you feeling?” Taisuke somehow was able to bring out.</p><p>Juri’s look turned from slightly disorientated to fully confused in seconds. He had no idea where he was or how the battle had ended, but the picture in front of him seemed even more confusing to him. Slowly Taisuke took down the towel he somehow still held awkwardly in the air, while Taiga crossed his arms to his exposed upper body with a weird hawk.</p><p>“Hey Taiga, I could only- oh, Juri! And- ehm what is going on here?” Hagi asked, obviously as confused as Juri, but also a bit scolding as he of course had been told to have an eye on Taiga, yet it seemed like Taisuke always showed up when they weren’t around for a second.</p><p>“Guys, give me a break,” Juri complained, rubbing his temples, obviously still in pain, which was understandable after all the impacts he had taken in. “I will go back to my room until you solve whatever this is and then can someone please explain to me what happened? And I mean the important stuff, thanks.”</p><p>With a hand movement at Taiga and Taisuke when talking about ‘this’, Juri went back straight to his room and closed the door as if nothing had happened. Meanwhile Hagi finally walked up to Taiga and pressed some clothes against his chest. He had changed already and gave Taisuke a look over his shoulder now.</p><p>“Right, I will tell the others that Juri woke up,” Taisuke said and when he entered the lab a heavy silence lay between Hagi and Taiga.</p><p>“Do I need to worry?” Hagi asked, but instead of feeling guilty, there was anger rising inside Taiga. He grabbed the shirt with an annoyed click of his tongue, leaving Hagi even more speechless.</p><p>“No you don’t and Myuto also doesn’t have to,” Taiga replied, which meant as much as no need to even tell Myuto. “I will talk to Juri.”</p><p>Without giving Hagi the chance to reply, Taiga headed towards the boy’s room, but he also felt sorry, because his own anger wasn’t Hagi’s fault. It was all because of the instinct. Now that it didn’t have to fight anymore, it just put up a wall to protect his and Taisuke’s emotions and it was as difficult to control as the urge to rip the other one apart.</p><p>***</p><p>“Why do you waste your time? If you want to know anything, look at that oh so awesome Vestige behind you. His mind reading ability will definitely tell you everything you need to know.”</p><p>Reo’s snappy attitude had even Hokuto taken aback as he behaved even more fiercely than he had back when he was indeed still their enemy. But it was obvious that even for Reo it was easier to play it this way than in his usual fun way.</p><p>“Did you use your mind reading on him already?” Katsuki asked and Hokuto nodded. He still leaned back at the metal door of their special observation room, for the first time really used on a Fallen, not that Reo would try to break out of it. Which would also not be that simple, because even with the lab shut down, the special observation room had a special security system as a backup which could be used right from the outside of the room. But that didn’t mean that Aran couldn’t take control of the room if he wanted to.</p><p>Hokuto had already told them the fake story about how they had captured him with his mind control and that he needed to be chained down, because of his illusion ability. Now exactly that had happened and Reo played with the chains, which were connected to two metal hooks in the ground, while Katsuki was standing in front of his chair and Konpi was sitting on one of the tables with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“We found out where their hideout is located, but when Juri went over to check on it, they had already abandoned it.”</p><p>“That reminds me, where is your transmitter?” Katsuki asked, but then Reo let out an annoyed sound and threw his head to the back.</p><p>“You know I feel like you interrogate him more than me. Would you mind and get lost if you want to waste his time instead?”</p><p>This time Konpi got up from the table and Hokuto bit the inside of his cheek when the boy lifted his leg and gave Reo a harsh kick to the stomach and left his leg up on the other one’s upper body as he leant down to him. Reo gave him a death glare and yanked on the chains, but picking a fight was no option for him.</p><p>“But like this it’s more fun,” Konpi said and pulled something out of his pocket and while Reo had no clue what it was, Hokuto’s eyes grew wide as he stepped away from the door.</p><p>“Why do you have that?” Hokuto asked, his voice not as steady as he wanted it to be.</p><p>“We have access to almost everything as Elite-Vestige and as we knew that you are in this Center we made sure to bring it,” Konpi said as he used unnecessary force to push himself away from Reo resulting with another angry glare from the Fallen.</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter, right?” Konpi asked, as he waved the remote control in front of Hokuto’s face. “We heard a lot of stories about you. But as calm as you are I am sure we are not talking to your Fallen self, right?”</p><p>Of course the Main Center had been still kept in the dark about Hokuto’s and Taiga’s transitions as well as all the other Fallen related news, yet this was the worst they could have brought with them. Because what if the remote suddenly worked? Now he was a Vestige, it was going to work, right? They would find out!</p><p>Hokuto’s panic got the best of him and he remained completely silent, which made Katsuki walk up to him with a skeptical look.</p><p>“We heard that in fights your Fallen self would take over, but you captured Reo without it?”</p><p>That question made Reo laugh so that they turned back to him, giving Hokuto a moment to get himself back together.</p><p>“You forget that Hokuto’s Fallen self can use his abilities as well. He is an asshole I can tell you that, but helping you guys out just to mock us, is something he also loves doing. He feels superior.”</p><p>“I would say he is, because now you are here and he is still with Hokuto,” Konpi mocked the other one.</p><p>“Is he?” Katsuki asked as he turned back to Hokuto, but this time the other one had gotten his act up again.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I was able to get rid of him, but unfortunately the Main Center didn’t come up with something until now and Kochi didn’t either, so I fear you have to live with the chance that he will show up if you go on my nerves too much.”</p><p>Konpi laughed on that, already looking forward to actually facing the Fallen self not knowing that for that he would need to meet Taiga now. “What a shame, then this thing is just a useless toy this time.”</p><p>Even though Konpi had said so, his finger went right to one of the buttons on it and Hokuto froze, ready to experience severe pain, yet nothing happened…</p><p>“Boring,” Konpi said as he put the remote back into his pocket.</p><p>“Do Elite-Vestige not have a microchip or why do you think it’s ok to just ‘try out’ if mine works?” Hokuto asked, trying to calm down his racing heartbeat.</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said as he gave Reo another look. “For now I think we won’t get anything out of him, so let’s discuss how we proceed from here. We need to report to the Main Center.”</p><p>Hokuto was grateful for the break he would get, but he also wanted to know why the remote wasn’t working, not that it was his priority to find out. For now they had to make a plan, which was difficult with them not being able to talk to each other. But maybe Aran could somehow help them to get Katsuki and Konpi out of the way long enough to come up with something. But for now Hokuto needed to know more about them and their special abilities before he could make any kind of plan.</p><p>***</p><p>"Okay, then I guess I should wait just a bit longer until I head back too," Juri concluded after getting a brief explanation from Taiga and of course the boy had left out all the stuff about Taisuke. Now they were in the lab with Myuto, Kentaro, Senga and Yokoo. But of course Juri could feel Myuto's eyes on Taiga.</p><p>"Yes, I think we should wait until we get a reply from Hokuto. As long as we don't know what is going on at the West Center I don't think you should head there too."</p><p>Myuto was right, but Juri was also feeling restless. He had gotten all the fake stories from the others, but for now he wanted to rest some more.</p><p>"Give me until the morning and I'll help you with your patrols, okay?" Juri said and of course everyone agreed and Juri excused himself for now.</p><p>"Guess we should also get ready. The others should be back soon," Kentaro said and it was obvious that all he wanted to do was to actually get out and find his brother. It was getting complicated to have Kentaro on a team without him, not that anyone could blame him.</p><p>"Taiga and I will go," Myuto announced on which Kentaro pouted, but when Hagi told him that they would go for the next one, Taiga knew that this was no random patrol and he sighed but headed to the door.</p><p>They walked in silence for quite a while until they had left the hideout behind them and at a rocky open surface Taiga finally stopped.</p><p>"Hagi told you, didn't he?"</p><p>Of course he had, Myuto was their leader and they were all worried for Taiga.</p><p>"I just want to remind you of our promise to Hokuto. You know that at some point you'll have to let Taiga take over again and he'll definitely ask me to dig out those memories," Myuto explained, but it was obvious that he also didn't want to do so, yet he wouldn't refuse if Taiga asked him. He had taken the dangerous step of letting his Fallen self take over for so long. He deserved to know what had happened, yet it was clear that the aftermath of knowing was going to be heavy.</p><p>"At least they won't be his memories."</p><p>The Fallen self had whispered the words ahead into the forest, but of course Myuto had heard him and when he let out a long breath he could see the breath forming a cloud in the air. It had gotten extremely cold, snow definitely about to fall.</p><p>"Look, I know that for Taiga's sake I have to try hard as well to not give him even worse memories and trust me when I tell you I'm trying."</p><p>Of course he had already failed once, but while it still remained a secret, Myuto obviously had caught up to the fact that something had happened. Yet Myuto didn't seem angry. His look was calm, but the worry for Taiga was obvious.</p><p>"I guess we all have to thank you for what you've done in the end, no matter if you or the instinct decide to do some harmful things in between."</p><p>The snort Taiga let out on hearing that made Myuto crack a smile this time. But he meant what he had said. The Fallen self could have betrayed them at all times, but for Taiga's sake he hadn’t done so.</p><p>"You had offered me a place back then," Taiga said as he looked up into the sky. "At that time I really wanted that place. I wanted my own life and I would have sacrificed Hokuto to get it."</p><p>"But not Taiga," Myuto concluded as he walked away from the other one with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>"Now I'm offered another place,” Taiga said his look a bit absentminded. "But exactly because of this connection I understand now what I would take away from Taiga to get my own happiness."</p><p>It was weird to hear him talk like this, because even though he had gone through a lot of changes through the instinct and two serums, in the end even the Reverse serum wouldn’t turn him as he was only a mindset and his body belonged to Taiga. That was luckily also why he had been able to put up an act with Taisuke before as the original Fallen serum didn’t really had any effect on him as he had always been a full Fallen and only the blood connection had powered up his instinct and had made staying in control a challenge.</p><p>"Then show me how determined you are," Myuto said as he had walked in front of Taiga at some distance and turned towards him with a challenging smile. "Show me what that instinct is capable of."</p><p>The invitation for a fight came as a surprise to Taiga and for a moment he looked startled until he also formed a brief smile and started moving his arms and neck with an exciting expression. "All injuries go on you. I won't hold back."</p><p>"I didn't ask you to," Myuto replied with another teasing smile before they both dashed to the front.</p><p>Being trapped all together in the hideout had caused them all a lot of growing tension so this fight was something they definitely needed. It was also a chance for Taiga to give his instinct a moment of release and try and keep his walls up as best as he could afterwards.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>There was not a single second in which Hokuto wasn't under supervision of one of the Elite Vestige. But while Katsuki had obviously talked to Jesse and Shintaro as well, it didn't seem like they had said anything out of the ordinary. Yet they were still quite suspicious especially because they weren't able to enter the lab.</p><p>"Did the Main Center contact you about Kochi?" Hokuto asked again as he was sitting in the common room with Konpi, a few Chasers scattered around the room, but it was obvious that they didn't like the presence of the Elite Vestige either.</p><p>"And again I'll tell you that this is none of your business," Konpi replied while he was lying with his upper body on the table, obviously not happy about playing babysitter for Hokuto.</p><p>"Kochi is the leader of the West Center, you took him without giving us further information about the reason, neither did you contact us or let him contact us. So yes this is my business," Hokuto let out a bit snappier this time.</p><p>Konpi sat up and gave him a warning look, but he wouldn't get provoked enough to spill any secrets. When Katsuki finally came back after he had a talk with Reo again, the boy's mood seemed to brighten up.</p><p>"Your turn to watch him," Konpi chirped and jumped up, but Katsuki stopped him before he could leave the room.</p><p>"I need you to stay for a bit longer."</p><p>Katsuki's request made a weird smile appear on the boy's lips before he turned back to Hokuto. "Great, then get up."</p><p>"What are you up to this time?" Hokuto asked, yet Konpi rolled his eyes as he stepped closer to the Vestige and slammed his foot on the bench he was sitting on. Some Chasers tensed on the boy’s behavior, but they knew that interfering would make things even worse. "You'll see soon enough, now stop asking unnecessary questions and get up."</p><p>Hokuto did how he was told, but he looked over to Jesse and Shintaro before they left the room. Both boys nodded at him, but they couldn't do much at the moment either. The Chasers weren't under strict supervision, but if they did something suspicious it could end in a disaster.</p><p>"Which one is your room?" Katsuki asked as they made it to the second floor and now Hokuto finally got worried.</p><p>"It doesn't matter if you lie, any room will do," Konpi added.</p><p>Hokuto showed them his room, but there was nothing they could actually find in here.</p><p>"Why are there Chaser clothes in your room?" Katsuki asked as he randomly picked up some clothes. Right, Taiga usually slept in his room most of the time so a lot of clothes had ended up in here as well.</p><p>When Hokuto didn't reply, Konpi got ready to threaten him once more, but Katsuki stopped him, this topic luckily not of his concern for now.</p><p>"We talked to everyone in this Center and we got either no information or the same useless information," Katsuki explained.</p><p>"So? I already told you what I know," Hokuto replied, but had his eyes on Konpi who kept walking around him.</p><p>"And to find out if any of you is lying we need you to talk to everyone."</p><p>This time Katsuki's words didn't make much sense to him until Konpi stopped right next to him with the same excited look as before.</p><p>"With the difference that I will be going instead of you."</p><p>Hokuto reacted intuitively and jumped back before Konpi could reach out for him, but Katsuki was blocking the door.</p><p>"As if I let you use your abilities on me."</p><p>"We will get Konpi to use his mind switch if you want to or not. So it depends on if you want it the hard way or the easy one?" Katsuki told him.</p><p>"Mind switch? So you can use my body, but put your own mind in it?"</p><p>"Exactly," Konpi said and walked slowly over to Hokuto once more. "I can only control your body for a certain amount of time and my body will be useless for that time, but I can take back all the memories from the time I used your body."</p><p>Which meant he didn't possess any kind reading ability, which was good to know. Now he had to decide though if he wanted to put up a fight or not. Would the others notice? Or would they spill their secrets to Konpi?</p><p>When the boy tried to jump at him once more Hokuto attacked for the first time, but before he could use any of his abilities he was thrown to the back, right into the wall. But the movement hadn't come from Konpi.</p><p>With a groan Hokuto got up again and gave Katsuki an annoyed look. The boy had barely moved. He had only lifted his hand.</p><p>"Telekinesis?"</p><p>"Exactly," Katsuki replied. "So you better choose wisely if you want to fight us."</p><p>Not fighting would make it more believable that they had no secrets, but if he fought…</p><p>"Even if I don't fight you, I cannot promise you that my Fallen self will stay silent," Hokuto warned them of a threat not existing anymore.</p><p>"That's fine with me. I want to meet him anyway," Konpi said clearly excited, but Hokuto backed off to the corner once more yet he knew that they weren't going to stop even if they had to face his Fallen self.</p><p>"Last chance," Katsuki said and lifted his hand, but this time Hokuto didn't run when Konpi got closer to him. He had to believe in the others to somehow find out that something was off. Fighting them now wouldn't make much sense and he was sure that the outcome was going to be the same.</p><p>"Oh, done running away? How boring," Konpi complained as Hokuto gave him an annoyed look, but didn't back off when the boy reached out for his face.</p><p>After a few seconds Katsuki walked over to them and the same as with mind controlling, Hokuto realized how he was losing control of his own thoughts, but he somehow still stayed in the back of his own mind. Maybe it was normal for this ability or it was because he had trained with Myuto and Taiga for similar abilities before.</p><p>Konpi collapsed to the back the next moment and Katsuki lifted him on the bed before he turned back to Hokuto.</p><p>"Did it work?" Katsuki asked, facing Hokuto.</p><p>"When did it not work?" Konpi asked with Hokuto's voice yet Hokuto could still follow their conversation. Maybe he could even kick him out if necessary? After all, he was able to do it with mind control.</p><p>"Hokuto is special after all, the Fallen self could interfere, so stay focused."</p><p>"Fine, then let's go," Konpi said and while he left the room, Katsuki stayed behind. Right, if they wanted someone to spill secrets there was no chance to get them if Katsuki was with him.</p><p>He made his way down to the main floor, but most Chasers had moved to the training room instead of the common area. Konpi aimed for Shintaro and Jesse, the two totally confused when Hokuto walked up to them.</p><p>"Where are the Elite-Vestige?" Shintaro asked, already on high alert.</p><p>"I was able to keep them busy with something else. Any updates?"</p><p>The question was well asked, because even though they didn't know about Hokuto and the others lying or not, the question could get interpreted in a lot of ways.</p><p>"Nothing so far," Jesse said and Hokuto cursed in his mind. They hadn't realized at all.</p><p>"But there is something about Reo. You remember when you said there was that mind block? I think we found a solution to get into that part," Shintaro said and while Konpi immediately asked what they had found out, Hokuto was left confused. What mind block? What was going on?</p><p>"You want to try?" Jesse asked after an explanation that could have never been made up by Jesse himself.</p><p>"But you should get at least one of the Elite Vestige. I don't want to end up in trouble," Shintaro added and Konpi actually agreed.</p><p>He got Katsuki and left Konpi in his room while they told Shintaro and Jesse to wait.</p><p>"They seriously need to clean this Center more often," Konpi complained as he lifted his hand to the air as a bit of dusk seemed to have risen from the floor in front of the special observation room.</p><p>"You can't use his special abilities, so we need to figure out what to do now," Katsuki said as they stopped in front of Reo's room.</p><p>"I'll just leave his mind at some point and you can force him to do that mind reading part the way the Chasers just said."</p><p>Katsuki agreed and entered the room first, Reo sitting silently on his chair with his head down.</p><p>"Did we get a sand storm or what?" Konpi complained once more and that was when it clicked.</p><p>Hokuto was still at the door while Katsuki had walked up to Reo and it was now or never. Hokuto put all his remaining strength into kicking Konpi out of his mind and the boy gasped, leaning to the front.</p><p>Katsuki on the other hand had reached out for Reo, but on the touch the illusion vanished and he swirled around with wide eyes.</p><p>Hokuto feared he wouldn't have enough time, but then he was grabbed by the back of his shirt and pulled out of the room while Reo slammed the door shut from the outside, leaving Katsuki trapped inside.</p><p>Hokuto kept fighting off Konpi and finally the boy's mind switch was gone, leaving Hokuto gasping for air.</p><p>"Reo? How? What is going on?" Hokuto asked and the boy gave him a bright smile and pointed up at the camera.</p><p>"You're welcome," Aran was heard, but not from the security system, but from right behind him.</p><p>"Konpi, he is still-"</p><p>"No he is not," Aran interrupted Hokuto as he was about to panic. "When you left your room without them I knew that something was off so I contacted the Chasers and gave them a plan on how to lure you two into this room while I unlocked Reo's room so that he could get out. The Chasers took care of Konpi the moment you two came to this room."</p><p>That explained at least why Shintaro and Jesse talked about something Hokuto had never heard about.</p><p>"I'll head over to help them. After all, it's an Elite-Vestige. We need to make sure to keep them separated and tied up," Reo offered and headed down the corridor.</p><p>"But they will contact the Main Center," Hokuto said as he got up, but once more Aran shook his head.</p><p>"I unplugged the antennas for now. They will realize that too, but not as fast. But you need to go out to the truck and contact the others, right?"</p><p>"How do you know all that?” Hokuto asked.</p><p>“Let’s say Kochi had made up a plan the moment you left the Center. He had already seen this outcome with the way we hid all the information from the Main Center for this long so he guessed that you would come up with a plan to come back here somehow.”</p><p>“Anyway, thank you. Without you we would have been screwed,” Hokuto thanked him. “But now we have to decide what to do next. I need to hear back from Shime and Noel if they found Kochi or not.”</p><p>***</p><p>“So you know the leader of the Elite Vestige?” Juri asked as he had finally recovered enough to have longer talks without getting a headache. Taiga and Myuto both nodded, but then Juri turned to Taiga. “How come you know him? You have not been with Taiga before this year.”</p><p>“I still have access to all his memories since we switched the first time, so I know Reia as well.”</p><p>“And he is one of the orphans you took care of, right? Are any of the other Elite Vestige also kids you know?”</p><p>Myuto shook his head as he lifted up the photos the others had sent them from the Vestige of the Centers. “No, these boys we don’t know. But it could be that the others are still part of the Main Center or-”</p><p>“That they died in their endless tests to create the Elite-Vestige,” Taiga said out loud what Myuto didn’t want to say. “After all they vanished when Myuto and others were still turned into Fallen. So they kept this research behind closed doors for years. Who knows how many people have died over that time.”</p><p>In a moment of uncomfortable silence the contact device on Miyata’s desk kicked in. The other Fallen were not in the lab, but they had all learned by now how to use the transmitter and Taiga hurried to put the signal through.</p><p>“Hey, sorry for the wait.”</p><p>“Hokuto! Are you guys okay?” Taiga was confused about his own worried voice as were Myuto and Juri obviously, but no matter if Taiga was not awake at the moment, the worry about Hokuto was a natural part even for the Fallen self.</p><p>“We had some trouble, but we kind of solved it for now. Aran helped us to overpower the Elite-Vestige and they are grounded for now, but the Main Center will soon realize so we have to act fast. Did Shime find Kochi?”</p><p>There was so much information to exchange, but for now Myuto felt calmer just by hearing that Aran was with them and safe.</p><p>“No, unfortunately not,” Myuto explained. “They have access to almost all parts of the Main Center, but they didn’t find him yet.”</p><p>“That is unfortunately what I thought.”</p><p>“What is on your mind?” Taiga asked.</p><p>“I doubt they just brought him in for a normal questioning. They have realized that we were doing something behind their backs. The Elite-Vestige even brought my remote just to test if my Fallen self was still with me.”</p><p>“What?” Juri let out, completely in shock about hearing that and his hand immediately went up to the back of his neck.</p><p>“Don’t worry it didn’t work, I am not sure why, but at least they couldn’t prove that my Fallen self wasn’t with me anymore.”</p><p>“Then what do we do?” Myuto asked, but they all remained silent for a moment.</p><p>“I have an idea, but it will be super reckless, yet it’s the only plan I can think of,” Hokuto finally said. “I thought a lot about something like we pulled off here at the West Center, but it might be too risky and I don’t want to put anyone else in the same danger I put Reo in.”</p><p>“So you want us to directly attack?” Myuto said, as that would give them the chance to use their full power on the Main Center.</p><p>“I know it sounds reckless, but we already have two Elite-Vestige captive, so I would say we should send some back up for the others to keep the Elite-Vestige away from the Main Center while we attack and use the chaos to get information about Kochi’s whereabouts. If Shime’s information are correct then only Reia is at the Main Center with other Vestige and soldiers right now.”</p><p>“Let me go in first,” Juri suggested, but everyone gave him a skeptical look. “They are waiting for me to return in the first place and I can pretend that I had been at the West Center first and make them believe that there is a problem with the Antenna and that is why they can’t contact their Elite-Vestige while I can also try and find out more about Kochi without being too suspicious. After all, Shime can’t just ask around for Kochi. Officially he shouldn’t even know that he is there.”</p><p>“But what about me?” Taiga asked as he was with Juri in their fake story.</p><p>“I can just say you stayed at the West Center to help out there.”</p><p>“Or we can also say you died in a fight against us if you want it more dramatic?” Myuto’s words had Taiga hit him against the shoulder and the other one chuckled, but then his look turned serious again.</p><p>“So we need to form teams and make a plan on how to proceed in an emergency,” Myuto explained and he looked at Juri who nodded.</p><p>“If you can’t contact me anymore then you know that they are definitely up to something. I am willing to take the risk and it might be easier to find out their motives like this in the first place. It’s not like we did anything bad with the serum, but Kochi was worried about telling them and I think he just got proven right.”</p><p>“Hokuto, we will make a plan and count how many people we have per team and contact you again,” Taiga promised and Hokuto told them to hurry and contact him before nightfall.</p><p>“So if our information are right, then there is one Elite-Vestige at all remaining Centers, but we only have one or two Chasers or Vestige from Shime’s team at each Center. Do we have enough people to pull this off?” Myuto asked a bit skeptical.</p><p>“Count us in.”</p><p>Everyone turned towards the door where Taisuke was leaning against the doorframe. “We owe you a lot so there is no way we will stay behind and just watch you run into your doom.”</p><p>“Thanks, the more people, the better,” Juri thanked the Fallen. “Then we have seven members from Taisuke’s group, five from Myuto’s group, Taiga and me.”</p><p>“Nika and I will head to the East Center,” Kentaro was heard behind Taisuke and the boy didn’t seem as if anyone could argue about that decision.</p><p>“We have enough people to send one or two more Fallen with you,” Myuto offered, but Kentaro shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t need even more people in my way. I will tell Nika. Let me know when you are ready to leave.”</p><p>Myuto shook his head at the other one as he left without even listening to the whole plan.</p><p>“Well, he is too stubborn to argue with anyway,” Taiga said and let him be.</p><p>“And if he gets his ass beaten then he can still ask for help,” Myuto added, discussing the remaining teams for now so that they could come up with a plan as soon as possible, not that they knew what kind of chaos they were bringing themselves into in the first place.</p><p>***</p><p>“That’s a ridiculous plan,” Aran complained after Hokuto had told everyone in the West Center what they were going to do, but of course no one was supportive of Juri running right into the lion cage.</p><p>“Kochi is no Vestige, there is no way he can get out of there by himself and over all these years it’s pretty clear to us that he always tried things different from the Government. You all know that,” Hokuto said and faced the Chasers who had gathered in the training room. “You stayed even after I told you about my Fallen self, you stayed when Taiga became a Fallen and you even stayed when we brought Myuto and the others into our Center. And you did it all because you believed in Kochi, so let me ask you, do you want him to take all the blame for what we have decided as well to do?”</p><p>Shintaro was the one to step to the front on Hokuto’s words. “It’s not that I don’t agree with the main plan,” Shintaro started. “I don’t agree with the part where we sit here and don’t beat the shit out of those Government bastards ourselves.”</p><p>The round of agreement going through the rows of Chasers made Hokuto smile while Aran rolled his eyes. “Fine, but I warn you, if anyone dares to do something that is not part of the plan I am here to beat your ass in Kochi’s name.”</p><p>“Aran could definitely take over for Kochi,” Jesse joked.</p><p>“Reo will stay here to make sure Konpi and Katsuki are under control and when Hagi arrives I will head to the Main Center,” Hokuto explained. “I know you don’t like staying back, but you have two Elite-Vestige here and don’t forget that they are extremely dangerous and if you let your guard down the West Center will be in trouble as well and we will need this place to retreat to in case things don’t go as planned.”</p><p>“Don’t worry we will make sure that no one can get even close to our Center,” Shintaro almost yelled. “I can’t wait to kick those two Vestige in their Elite ass and with that out of this Center for good.”</p><p>“Make sure to stay in contact with the others, I will be in the lab,” Aran said towards Hokuto.</p><p>“Do you think you can somehow enter their system?” Hokuto asked after Aran had said he would try to hack into their system over a non-trackable device he had used in Myuto’s hideout before.</p><p>“Maybe, but if they find out then Kochi and Juri are in danger so I need to be really careful.”</p><p>They all had to be careful, but also fast, because Hokuto just couldn’t shake off that weird feeling about the Government suddenly moving out to all Centers this aggressively because of unrelated reasons to the West Center as well.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>The problem wasn’t to get into the Main Center, it was more about getting out again. Juri had given everyone all the possible details about what kind of story he would tell the members of the Main Center, yet at least Miyata was listening to everything as he had given Juri the last contact device they had. It was as big as Kochi’s old transmitter so he had to hide it in one of the pockets of his combat vest. It was able to record all the conversations around, but he would need to take it out to record pictures or videos so they wouldn’t know where exactly he was or who he was talking to. It also didn’t have a tracker, but they had to take what they had.</p><p>The researchers and soldiers of the Center greeted Juri with the respect he deserved as a Vestige, because no matter if the government had suddenly put the new Elite-Vestige in charge, all Vestige were officially commanding everyone else in all Centers. Except for the Center leaders and the government members, not that many of them were usually around at the gates.</p><p>“I heard that Kochi had been brought to the Main Center a few days ago. I am here to pick him up as our Center experienced some antenna problems and as we cannot access the lab without him, we will be an easy target for Fallen,” Juri explained to one of the soldiers in charge.</p><p>“Sorry to put you through the trouble. You can find him in sector B2.”</p><p>The soldier bowed and walked away, but Juri could only give him a slightly confused look.</p><p>“Something is going on,” Juri whispered, knowing that everyone in Taisuke’s hideout was listening and giving the information to the remaining teams. The moment something went wrong they would all carry out their parts in the remaining plan. For now they had to stand back or Juri could get in even more trouble.</p><p>The Main Center was in a normal routine as it seemed, nothing out of the ordinary, but sector B was a place Juri didn’t want to enter again. It was the place where every new Vestige was usually under a test after their transition. Their abilities and possible special abilities got tested there and it wasn’t a pleasant memory for any of them. As the sector B2 would usually only hold Vestige it was obvious that they were up to something as Kochi would usually always be in the research sector A if he visited the Main Center.</p><p>The B sector of the Main Building was silent and almost no people crossed his way, but with no new Vestige there was no need for the sector at the moment, but that was also why Juri didn’t like it. It just felt so forbidden, so dreary. </p><p>“They know,” Juri whispered again, just having that really bad feeling about the whole situation. “There is no way they would keep Kochi here if it was just an interrogation.”</p><p>They had all their research and paper work facilities in sector A so it didn’t make any sense to bring Kochi into this sector. Nevertheless Juri made his way to sector B3 from where he would need to enter the next sector.</p><p>His steps echoed in the empty room, the place Vestige would fight each other for the very first time to then get told which Center they would belong to after weeks of tests and trainings. Juri had aimed to be part of the Main Center at that time, but his special ability wasn’t useful enough for them and he had been extremely down to be send to the West Center, yet meeting Kochi there had changed everything and he was not going to let the Government take the boy’s hard work away.</p><p>In the middle of the room Juri stopped, letting out a sigh.</p><p>“So I guess you will tell me now that I am not allowed any further?”</p><p>Of course the others couldn’t see who he was talking to, not that Juri could as he wasn’t seeing the other one yet, but he knew that he wasn’t alone and a moment later he heard footsteps on the other side of the room and a boy stepped out of the shadows.</p><p>“I fear so yes,” the boy said and while Juri wasn’t allowed to say his name as he wasn’t supposed to know him in the first place, he was sure that Myuto and Taiga recognized the voice of the Elite-Vestige leader. “But how about I listen to your story? I bet you came up with some pretty amazing detailed fake story to make it this far.”</p><p>Of course they had realized that everything had been fake.</p><p>“An antenna problem was it, right? What a coincidence that it occurred after Hokuto brought in a Fallen,” Reia said as he walked closer to Juri with his hands on his back and a calm smile on his lips.</p><p>“Please feel free to go and check yourself, the two Elite Vestige at our Center couldn’t help fixing it either. Which reminds me, you seem to know me, yet I don’t know you.”</p><p>“Playing the clueless card, I see,” Reia replied. “Then let me do you the favor and play along. I am Nakamura Reia, the leader of the Elite-Vestige and currently in charge of all Centers.”</p><p>The arrogance the boy spoke with made Juri want to roll his eyes, yet he tried to stay as neutral as possible. “Then would you mind telling me what is going on? Because the other two didn’t really want to give me any information.”</p><p>“As they are supposed to. But what they are also not supposed to do is letting you go to the Main Center, no matter the circumstances at your Center,” Reia replied and that fact made it even more clear that Reia was more than aware that the West Center had come up with a plan to get Kochi out. “So do you want to try again and tell me what is going on?”</p><p>Juri had to calculate well what he was going to say as Reia didn’t seem aware of Myuto or Taisuke being on their side now. Hokuto had said it as well that the other two had tried to get information, so all they knew was that something was going on, but not exactly what it was.</p><p>“I hoped you could tell me, because you took our leader away from an unprotected Center while no Vestige was present and now they are even without the security of the lab or the connection to the other Centers. But if you can’t tell us then I will take my leave and ask someone else for help.”</p><p>The way Reia’s smile grew wider on Juri’s words made it clear that there was no way he would let Juri leave like this. But it also meant that the others were going to carry out their plan B now and Juri wasn’t that fond of it, not that he felt in any way capable of fighting his way out of the Main Center and also find Kochi on the way, so all he could do was buying time for the others to make their way to the Centers before Reia could actually try and get the other Elite Vestige back to the Main Center.</p><p>“As much as I am up for all this fake talking and playing games, I unfortunately do not have the time to play around with you the whole day,” Reia said as he finally changed his attitude and Juri immediately made a step back as he could tell that the boy wasn’t bluffing.</p><p>“You have no proof that the West Center did anything that would allow you to keep Kochi or me at the Main Center,” Juri shot back, but Reia shook his head.</p><p>“Then who will stop me?”</p><p>That was the question indeed and it just proved that the Government was behind all of this in the first place and letting the Elite-Vestige run wild like this wasn’t helping anyone but them for now, as the Centers would now end up fighting against their own people.</p><p>They both froze in their movements for a while until Reia took another step to the front and Juri didn’t want to take his chances as he was sure that without any effective special ability he wasn’t’ going to stand a chance so he turned around and dashed for the stairs.</p><p>What he hadn’t seen coming was Reia’s speed, which was even more impressive than that of a Fallen. The boy showed up right next to him and Juri jumped back the moment Reia tried to reach out for his face.</p><p>“A special ability that needs contact? What is it, mind reading?” Juri asked, making the question as obvious as possible so the others got to know about the boy’s special ability.</p><p>“Oh, it’s not as simple as that and also not as harmless as all the mind abilities you have experienced until now.”</p><p>That didn’t sound good, but Juri had no time to ask more questions as Reia attacked straight on this time, chasing Juri through the room, not wasting time with any other attacks. All he obviously needed was his hand on Juri’s face, but that was exactly what Juri needed to prevent.</p><p>“Don’t make it this so complicated,” Reia complained as he stopped and that right in time for Juri to catch his breath for a moment. The boy was incredibly fast and coordinated. “I would tell you that you don’t have to be afraid, but my ability will unfortunately teach you the exact opposite.”</p><p>Juri could only raise an eyebrow on that statement before he had to start running again, but he soon found himself cornered and he tried to find any opening, but even though he was sure that he was going to be able to get his hand on the boy for a shockwave first, it was him who was thrown into the wall without any direct contact and yet the impact had been huge. As huge as if Yuma had hit him with his special ability.</p><p>“What was that? Do you have more than one special ability?” Juri asked as he tried to get up again, but it was difficult for him to get his orientation back.</p><p>“Way better,” Reia said and lifted his hand. “We Elite-Vestige can use our shockwaves from a meter distance, so we don’t have to touch you and while our shockwave is weaker on distance you definitely could tell right now that we are way stronger than you even on that distance.”</p><p>Just the fact that this shockwave had been his weakest one, made Juri fear that not even the Fallen would stand a chance against the Elite-Vestige.</p><p>“If you want to talk then this is your last chance,” Reia offered, making Juri laugh.</p><p>“With your attitude there is no way that talking to you about anything will have any positive outcome,” Juri replied as he got back up and got ready to face the other one head on this time as he knew that running away wouldn’t help him.</p><p>“Great, then I guess we will have a talk later and I am already looking forward to your friends getting to know about it, but for now they are unfortunately not allowed to be part of the rest of the fight.”</p><p>Another outcome Juri should have already seen coming and when Reia dashed right at him the next time, Juri could barely dodge the boy’s shockwaves, but Reia’s aim had been the boy’s vest and he ripped the contact device out of the pocket before he send Juri with a direct shockwave right on his chest to the ground this time.</p><p>The force had Juri cough blood with just one impact and with a curse he tried to get up once more, but he couldn’t easily move.</p><p>“Interesting. This looks like the device the Centers used quite some time ago, so I guess this is not one of Kochi’s toys?”</p><p>When Juri didn’t reply, Reia walked up to him and stepped on his leg when Juri failed to get up in time. Even their normal physical strength was way higher than theirs and while Myuto and Taisuke were also quite strong, Reia’s strength was of another level as he only had to step down a bit more to make Juri whine and try to get his leg free, which was about to snap under the pressure. “Playing tough? Well, then let’s ask the one on the other side. Who am I talking to?”</p><p>No reply. The silence made Reia laugh before he leant down to Juri who tried to use the moment when Reia stepped away from his leg to use a shockwave on the boy, but of course Reia had been faster and sent Juri right into the ground once more.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to talk to me?” Reia asked once more, but of course the device stayed silent. This time Reia tried to reach out for Juri’s face, but the boy still had some strength left to fight, yet Reia just grabbed his wrist and crushed his bones with his grip, making Juri scream out this time. Not getting a break, Reia put his hand on the boy’s chest and used his strongest shockwave to crush his ribcage.</p><p>This time Juri couldn’t even scream, all he did was fall back with his head on the floor with a pained cough. “Last chance.”</p><p>There was no way that they would talk to Reia as that had been their most important rule. No matter what happened they wouldn’t tell anyone who they were or what they were up to, it was just too risky. The Government had messed up the moment they had taken Kochi by force and put them under supervision of Elite-Vestige they didn’t even know and who didn’t give them any clear answers. So they wouldn’t give them any information either.</p><p>“Well, I guess then we have to wait for the next person coming to rescue both of you?” Reia mocked Juri as he finally put his hand on the boy’s face. It had been such a short touch, not even the slightest painful or long enough to even say if it was connected to an ability or not and at first nothing happened while Reia got up.</p><p>“But let me make it a bit more complicated for you,” Reia said into the device. “I'll give you a hint though. If you come here, then you will find one, but not the other one. Now you have to decide who will need your help first.”</p><p>Another useless information as they had already made that point clear as well. The Main Center was their main goal and no matter if Kochi or Juri, they would free whoever they found there and then keep looking in case anyone was taken away from the Main Center.</p><p>It was the moment when Juri felt as if he was going to be fine that his whole world around him shattered. There had been no sign of pain, no warning of what was going on in his mind, but before the others could hear what was going on, Reia crushed the device in his hand. Just a moment before Juri turned to the side, fisted his hair with shaking hands and let out a scream so desperate that it didn’t even sound like his own voice.</p><p>***</p><p>“No Hokuto, you are not going yet,” Aran complained, but the boy was getting ready to leave.</p><p>“Hagi left the hideout already, while the others are also already on their way to the other Centers. He will be here in a few hours, but Juri and Kochi don’t have that much time,” Hokuto said and kept walking down the corridor, but Aran ran in front of him and blocked his way.</p><p>“It’s not about the West Center though. Shime and Noel are on stand-by too, you can’t go in there without Taisuke’s team arriving and they will take the longest.”</p><p>“That doesn’t mean I can’t be right at their front gate already to beat the shit out of that freaking brat,” Hokuto complained.</p><p>“Can you hold back? Will you be able to wait for them?” Aran asked and it was a fair question as Hokuto had freaked out the moment they got the update that Juri had been caught after all and that not in a harmless way.</p><p>“I know it’s hard to believe, but yes I will be able to wait for them,” Hokuto said and tried to calm down. “Aran, I know you don’t know us that well yet, but trust me when I tell you that I had a lot of freaking out moments before and they were a lot worse. Yet I have learned my lesson and a few harsh ones were from you and Myuto.”</p><p>That reminder made a shadow pass Aran’s face, but then Hokuto put his hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Please Aran, I need to be as close as I can so that we won’t waste any time. We have no clue what they are up to.”</p><p>Aran of course understood the other one’s worries, but a huge impact on the special observation room door at the end of the corridor had Aran jolt. “Can he finally stop that?” Aran complained, but next to the door Reo was sitting on the ground, hitting the door and laughing at Katsuki’s attempts to break the door. But Aran was indeed worried that the Elite-Vestige’s strength could actually damage the room.</p><p>“Trust Reo and Hagi to keep the Center safe, okay?” Hokuto asked and the boy finally nodded.</p><p>“I wish I could give you a transmitter, but everything that stays in any way in contact with the Government is too dangerous to be used and I have not enough time to take the trackers out.”</p><p>“It’s okay, just make sure to report back to Miyata in case something is up, he can give the information to Shime so that we know as well,” Hokuto reminded him and of course it counted the other way around as well. It was quite a complicated way to stay in contact, but they had no other choice for now.</p><p>“Taisuke’s team will soon reach the Capitol borders,” Tama was heard on the contact device and Hokuto took another deep breath. After Myuto and then Taisuke they finally faced their most dangerous battle against their own Government.</p><p>***</p><p>“Wasn’t it the plan that we wait here for Chaka?” Nika asked while Kentaro just kept walking towards the East Center without any caution.</p><p>“He can’t even contact us and who knows if that stupid Elite-Vestige didn’t already realize that he is up to something, so I won’t sit around here and do nothing. We will only waste our time if we wait,” Kentaro said while he walked out to the open surface in front of the East Center, immediately setting off the Fallen alarm with it, because no matter if they received the serum or not, it would still spot them as Fallen. Luckily they all knew their way around the minefields of all Centers thanks to Shime and the others, but they still had to watch out that no new weapons had been placed in their way.</p><p>“Fine, but you deal with him then, because you brought this on yourself,” Nika teased his little brother, not that Kentaro wasn’t looking forward to dealing with them.</p><p>They stopped at a safe distance to their weapon system and Kentaro waited, but no one made it out of the front gate.</p><p>“Damn, I hate those Elite-Vestige already,” Kentaro hissed. “Hey you arrogant Vestige bastard, come out here.”</p><p>Kentaro’s yelling didn’t have the effect he wanted it to have, but after Taisuke had run over the East Center and killed almost all its members it was to no one’s surprise that the members wouldn’t easily open their security system and the Elite-Vestige with them knew of course that he was safer inside as well.</p><p>“What do we do if he has already left?” Nika asked, but Kentaro shook his head.</p><p>“If that was the case then Chaka would have definitely found a way to open the gates for us, so I am sure he is still in there. So as long as he doesn’t let us in, he can also not get out.”</p><p>“So our mission will be easy,” Nika replied, but Kentaro kicked the sand with a pouting expression.</p><p>“And here I wanted a fight and not a stupid standoff.”</p><p>“Be patient and you will get it,” Nika soothed him, but now they had to make sure to not let their guard down and hope that Chaka was able to somehow let Miyata know about the situation.</p><p>***</p><p>The tension inside the group was cutting through the air, but there was no way that Taiga wasn’t going to head to the Main Center with Kochi and Juri being there and Hokuto also on his way. Myuto going with him was also natural, but having Taisuke on the same team made everything complicated.</p><p>Yet it wasn’t Taisuke who was at fault for that as he was walking in the front without any complaints. He had made a good point when they had decided the teams, because all other Centers only needed to hold back the Elite-Vestige, but they had no clue how many people they were actually going to face at the Main Center now that they had started a rebellion. So having two Fallen with the instinct on that team was their best shot to get in and out alive. Myuto’s abilities were also extremely helpful if they faced a lot of resistance.</p><p>Taiga wasn’t that fond of the idea though and while Myuto was kind of happy that he reacted this way, he also knew that it was partly played, which was worrying him.</p><p>“If you don’t concentrate on the fight we will get into trouble.”</p><p>Taiga didn’t react to Myuto's words so he hit the other one against the arm. The confused look he received made him roll his eyes. “This is exactly what I mean.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You get distracted too easily. You don’t have to pretend. It will make things just more complicated.”</p><p>“Why would I be distracted?” He replied to his own question seconds later when he kept looking ahead once more with the same distracted look and this time Myuto hit him against the back of his head, getting a death glare in return.</p><p>“Stop pretending that you are fine. I know that you are not and he does too, because he feels the same, so could you both cut it out?”</p><p>On Myuto's words, Taisuke only slightly turned his head towards them as he could of course hear them, but he was handling the situation way better than Taiga. “Just behave normal, would you? I am not going to start scolding you in the middle of the fight, I don’t have time for that, but if you don’t stop tiptoeing around each other you are of no use to us.”</p><p>Taiga understood the other one’s anger, but there was still a bit more to the story than Myuto knew, but Taiga also had to make sure to stay concentrated or the situation could indeed turn out to their disadvantage.</p><p>“Just remember that Hokuto will be present too, so get prepared for that,” Myuto reminded him.</p><p>Hokuto knew that they were heading towards the Main Center, but they had only spoken briefly over the transmitter and the Fallen self wasn’t sure how to face him, knowing that Hokuto wanted Taiga back as soon as possible and the instinct wasn’t making that part any easier.</p><p>“For now let’s hurry so that we can meet with Shime and get an update on the other Centers,” Myuto added and then he went to the front and pushed Taisuke back a bit, the other on walking slower and letting him pass. A moment later Taiga caught up to him and they stopped, giving each other an uncomfortable look.</p><p>“Get your stuff together now, you won’t have time for it later,” Myuto yelled back at them, knowing that this was the only way for them to get their tension worked out before it could actually get into the way.</p><p>With a sigh Taiga started walking again and Taisuke soon joined next to him, but while they didn’t actually talk they could work things out like this too. All they had to do was to get their instincts to calm down next to each other, but what seemed like an easy task, was a tough challenge of patience for them.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>The boy in front of them didn’t look threatening, but everything that was going on around him was telling them something different. A red hair strand in his short black hair and the golden way to flashy looking long jacket under a white leather jacket made him look like a rock band member, but definitely not like an Elite-Vestige.</p><p>“Welcome to the South Center, we’ve been awaiting you,” Rinne said, but Mitsu told Yuma and Moro to stay at a safe distance as almost all members of the Center were outside the Security fence and ready to attack. What made the situation even worse was that right behind the security fence they saw Matsuku and Umi, tied up and Dragnacit blades pointed at them.</p><p>“I don’t remember telling you that we were coming,” Mitsu said. The boy laughed and played with the unnecessary fur on his shoulder.</p><p>“You didn’t have to. I got contacted from the East Center that some Fallen were causing trouble outside so they contacted the remaining Centers.”</p><p>So without transmitters their timing had been the worst. They could only hope that the others made it in time before any of the Elite-Vestige could actually make it back to the Main Center to make it even harder for Myuto’s team.</p><p>“But it seems like you have some trouble with your own people? The boys over there don’t seem to be Fallen,” Mitsu said as he lied about not knowing the other two.</p><p>“Yes indeed, but that is also something you are totally aware of, aren’t you?” Rinne replied, making it clear that he somehow had found out about their connection. The question was how much had he found out and what was his special ability. He had turned the whole Center against Matsuku and Umi so now it was almost impossible to make them realize that their real enemy was actually right there with them.</p><p>“If you think so,” Mitsu said and shrugged his shoulders. “But you might want to reconsider, because even if you are a Vestige, we are three Fallen and I doubt you will stand a chance against us without the help of another Vestige.”</p><p>“Oh, who said I will fight you?” Rinne asked with a smirk and then he lifted his hand, all the Chasers around him lifting their weapons.</p><p>Mitsu had to watch out not to act too obviously, but now they had to come up with a plan. They didn’t want to hurt or in the worst case kill any Chasers, but they had no other chance and they also needed to keep an eye on Rinne.</p><p>“Such a coward,” Moro whispered in the back. Rinne was sacrificing the Chasers with them having no choice, but to obey his orders.</p><p>There was not much time to think when Rinne sent the Chasers into battle while he retreated behind the security fence. Mitsu whispered towards the other two to make sure to not kill any of the Chasers, but to fight as realistic as possible.</p><p>When Mitsu went for a first attack and stopped the movements of the Chasers in front of him to be able to knock them out, he realized that Rinne was of course analyzing their special abilities, but there was something else he was up to and Mitsu cursed when the boy walked up to Matsuku who gave him a death glare when he stepped next to him.</p><p>Without a warning Rinne took the blade from one of the Chasers and stabbed Matsuku in the shoulder with it, making the boy scream out. Umi immediately jumped up, but was tackled down by the other Chasers and with his hands on his back he couldn’t do much.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to keep fighting?” Rinne shouted over to them, but Mitsu wasn’t sure what he meant until Moro knocked out another Chaser and Matsuku received another cut on his arm. Then the same happened when Moro knocked someone out.</p><p>“If you want to kill your own people go ahead,” Mitsu shouted back and stopped the movement of more Chasers and grabbed one by the collar while Rinne gave him a challenging look as he put the blade on Matsuku’s thigh this time and waited for Mitsu to attack the Chaser.</p><p>There was no way Rinne would care if Matsuku and Umi lived or died, but they couldn’t sacrifice themselves for hostages, so they had to think of something and that fast!</p><p>***</p><p>It had been the best decision to leave the contact device with Aran, but it made things even more difficult for Hokuto as he was getting closer to the Main Center. The Center was obviously already on high alert, but when he saw some trucks with Chasers and Vestige leaving, he hoped that their plan of first attacking the outer Centers once more as Taisuke’s group had done before as well, had worked out well. Instead of the Elite-Vestige leaving to come back to the Main Center, a lot of Chasers and Vestige went out to help them as they felt confident that their Main Center security was perfect. And it was, almost.</p><p>Hokuto wasn’t able to get close to the double security fence they had around the Center and he knew that except for the entrance area around the gate, there were tons of hidden weapons so he wouldn’t even try to sneak up close to it. Not just Fallen, but also normal Chasers would immediately set off an alarm if getting too close to it. The security fences were also more than dangerous. While the first one was more of a warning and had a voltage that could kill humans, but could also badly hurt Fallen, the second one could be deadly even to them.</p><p>Around the area where the last ruins were giving him shelter he stopped and moved away from the gate. 50 meters to the left, the second building to the back, on the roof. As they had discussed it he found Shime and Noel on the rooftop. Noel was concentrated on his binoculars to see what was going on at the main gate area while Shime had made sure that no one was sneaking up on them, so he awaited Hokuto at the stairs already.</p><p>“Everything alright here?” Hokuto asked as he joined them behind a wall and sat down.</p><p>“Here yes, but the others have some trouble. Fortunately they have drawn the Main Center's attention though,” Shime replied.</p><p>“What kind of trouble?”</p><p>“Nika and Kentaro are stranded in front of the East Center. There is no contact from Chaka, so most likely Taiko, who is the Elite-Vestige in that Center, has already thought about the possibility of a traitor and keeps them all under custody while not letting Nika and Kentaro start a pointless fight. Mitsu’s team might also be in trouble, because Miyata got contacted by Matsuku, but in between the connection died. Only at the North Center they seem to have succeeded in opening the gates for them so that they can fight inside.”</p><p>“At least we know a bit about what is going on. Any news from Taiga’s group?”</p><p>Shime shook his head and Noel looked up at them and also said that they hadn’t showed up anywhere around the Center yet.</p><p>“They were told to wait a bit so that the Main Center thinks they are safe, so I think we need to be patient for a bit longer,” Noel said before he concentrated back on the gates.</p><p>“Will you be alright?” Shime asked after a moment of silence, but Hokuto didn’t quite understand what he meant and gave him a questioning look. “There is so much going on, you know. You had to leave your own Center members with two Elite-Vestige, not able to head back to them in case something happens, Juri and Kochi are in danger and Taiga is, well, not in the best condition either.”</p><p>Hokuto had formed a short grimace on Taiga’s name as he knew of course that Taiga and Taisuke on the same team could mean trouble, even with Myuto. He didn’t even get the chance to talk to him yet, nor did he know what exactly had been going on in Taisuke’s hideout while he was gone, but he also knew that it wasn’t the time for his personal problems.</p><p>“We have to concentrate on Juri and Kochi, as soon as we find them, I can think about all the other chaos.”</p><p>***</p><p>Two Fallen with strong special abilities and yet they couldn’t beat Yabana, the Elite Vestige in their way. Genta and Shizu had opened the security fence and gates before any other Center could warn them about the Fallen and luckily Senga and Yokoo had been on time to make it inside. Now Genta wasn’t able to help them anymore though as he and Shizu had to take care of two other Vestige and a dozen of Chasers who thought of them as traitors. It was impossible to make them understand that they were doing this to help, but at least it took the focus away from the Fallen.</p><p>Senga and Yokoo both needed to get close to use their special abilities, but the boy in front of them had immediately lifted his hand to stop them and without knowing what was going on, they both hissed and fell to their knees, covering their ears. The horrible high pitched sound in their ears stopped after several seconds, but it was enough for the boy to run away from them. Luckily he wouldn’t easily make it to the gates and somehow they were sure that he wasn’t actually running because he was afraid of losing, he liked games. </p><p>“Stupid child,” Senga hissed as he got up, but needed a moment to find his balance. The same as with Hagi’s ability their balance got affected, but it was the direct pain the high pitched noise caused that was the worst part.</p><p>“If I didn’t know that he was dangerous, I would totally give him an older brother like scolding for all this shit,” Yokoo complained and he was right, because the age of the Elite-Vestige was indeed questionable. Yabana had a shirt with pink stars on it and a way too flashy white leather jacket with tons of silver metal studs on it. The white strand of hair that was hanging almost over his eyes with his too long hair didn't make it easy to see him as a strong opponent, but he indeed was and they had to make sure to not underestimate him.</p><p>***</p><p>The Main Center had again fallen silent after a while, so had their team as they restlessly waited for any movement. The others wouldn’t meet up with them as they were the distraction to get them in, so all they could do was wait for something to happen.</p><p>There was so much to worry about that Hokuto hated the silence, hated to wait. But the sound of sirens made him finally snap out of his dark thoughts and they all looked up to the Main Center where the Fallen sirens had been activated and red lights were flickering on the roof of the gigantic front building of the Center. The three main buildings were not just protected by a double security fence, but also by a huge metal building, which was more of a castle wall than anything else.</p><p>“Can you see them?” Shime asked, but Noel’s silence showed that he still didn’t see them.</p><p>“They won’t just run to the front gate, will they?” Shime asked a bit worried. When the next thing they heard were explosions from around the open area of the Security fence, their question got answered. They had set off the mines in front of the main gate and a huge dust cloud covered the area for several minutes.</p><p>“There they are,” Noel said and pointed towards the gate area. “What a dramatic entrance.”</p><p>“Let me see,” Hokuto demanded and Noel handed him the binoculars. What he saw though made him take a way too tight hold on the fragile tool in his hands. Myuto wasn’t anywhere to be seen, which meant he was back up. A good plan, that was for sure, but while the rest of their plan was also well thought through it just made a lot of rage boil inside of Hokuto, no matter if played or not.</p><p>Taisuke had showed up out of the dust cloud and had thrown Taiga right in front of the gates. The boy behaved as if he was badly wounded or more...they had actually hurt Taiga to make it seem more realistic. A fact that had Hokuto even angrier. Sure Taiga would heal fast enough to fight if he got attacked, but luring them out by pretending that Taisuke had taken a Chaser hostage could also backfire.</p><p>“Those Elite-Vestige won’t fall for this,” Hokuto said. “One Chaser is not enough to make them open the gates.”</p><p>“Then they just have to stop pretending at some point and come up with something else, but we have to move now,” Shime reminded them and they got ready to leave. No matter if they came out or not, their weapons were all on them and every soldier and Vestige left in the Center would have their eyes on them now. Unfortunately Hokuto had to take his eyes off them for now and hope that things wouldn’t get even more out of hand. </p><p>***</p><p>It was difficult for Aran to stay concentrated with all the information he got from Miyata. Things didn’t become too difficult yet, but also hadn’t worked out as smooth as they had hoped. Not to forget that the lab kept showing alarms for the door of the special observation room as Katsuki didn’t stop trying to destroy it with his telekinesis. Reo and now Hagi as well were guarding the room just in case, but that left Konpi with the Chasers and that was also something Aran wasn’t too happy about. Sure they had chained him down in the training room, telling everyone to keep their distance, but they still didn’t know how many secrets the boys actually had.</p><p>Trying to focus, Aran took a deep breath and went through more of the Main Center data he was accessing without them realizing yet. Kochi had luckily told him some secrets about the connection between the Centers, otherwise he wouldn’t even be able to access any files with their antenna being down.</p><p>He was on it for several hours already needing to take logout breaks to not raise any alarm in the Main Center. Until now he hadn’t found anything too suspicious, but he had finally found some folders, which were heavily password guarded and after nerve wrecking thirty minutes he finally had the first one open. He had hoped for Elite-Vestige data, which could help them in their fight, but what he got instead had his eyes widened.</p><p>“No way…” Aran let out in disbelief as he went through the files. There was just too much that shocked him about the information he was seeing, but then he went to the next file, a familiar name popping up and with an empty stare he fell back in his chair.</p><p>“How could you…” Aran whispered, but was interrupted by another alarm of the special observation room. A look on the monitor showed that the door was already bending, a bad sign indeed. But would he have enough time to find helpful information? Was there even any helpful information? Maybe sitting around here wasn’t the best option for him after all.</p><p>After almost an hour of desperate searching, Aran was sure that he wouldn’t find anything helpful, at least not for now. What he had found though were names and places and a plan he couldn’t believe was existing. Now the question was what to do with that information? His anger had reached its peak and with a determined look he got up, realizing that it was indeed not the time to sit around.</p><p>***</p><p>“I really hope you know what you are doing,” Hokuto asked skeptically as Noel used some remote he hadn’t seen until now and after a few minutes he told them to follow him through the open space behind the Center.</p><p>“I could explain to you what I am doing, but to make it understandable, the mines are deactivated, the cameras and sensors frozen on a non-movement screen and we can make it to the fence without anyone seeing us.”</p><p>“Sounds too easy,” Hokuto said, but he needed to trust him, otherwise they wouldn’t make it in at all.</p><p>“It will only work on a small radius and for a really brief time so we have to hurry.”</p><p>As they made it to the high electricity fence, Noel brought out another tool and Hokuto cursed when Noel just clipped it to the fence without any hesitation. “Dude, warn me before you try to kill yourself.”</p><p>Shime patted him on the shoulder with an understanding look. “Trust me we all needed some time to get used to it, but he really knows what he is doing.”</p><p>“I indeed do, so climb or we won’t make it,” Noel said as he disconnected the tool and jumped on the fence, making Hokuto look in disbelief. “Just stay in a 2 meter radius to the sides or you will get grilled.”</p><p>When they made it on top of the second fence, Hokuto could spot some warning lights turning green with a special kind of siren noise, which also had Shime look up. “Someone went out to them.”</p><p>Now the question was who? But there were three buildings behind the gate, with no chance of spotting whoever had decided to actually step out to Taiga and Taisuke. It had also taken them a lot of time to make it this far, so who knew what Taisuke had done in the meanwhile to actually make them finally show themselves.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he will be fine, you have to believe in his strength,” Shime reminded the other one.</p><p>“It’s not his ability to fight I worry about,” Hokuto replied honestly before he concentrated back on their part of the plan. “So what’s your tool to get inside?”</p><p>Of course Noel gave the other one a lopsided smile on the question and got something else out of his tool bag, but this time Hokuto raised an eyebrow. “Wait, isn’t that just a lock-picking set?”</p><p>“Sometimes the most basic tools are the best,” Noel said with a wink before he pointed to a corridor. “But the doors are all inside their corridors so I need you to take care of the guards first.”</p><p>“Oh finally something you can’t take care off?” Shime teased, but headed towards the corridor with Hokuto. The corridors had an extra gate so the guards hadn’t been able to see them making it over the fence, but that was only thanks to Noel’s remote. Now they had to make sure to get them knocked out before they could set off any alarm and they also knew that with someone now out at the gate they had to hurry before the fight could escalate. They were here to get people out and not more stuck.</p><p>***</p><p>“I have enough of this,” Kentaro said after walking up and down in front of the security fence for hours.</p><p>“Just go closer if you are bored, they will open fire and then you can play around a bit, but that’s all you will get,” Nika said while he hadn’t even moved from his spot at all, his eyes fixed on the Center in case someone tried to get away unnoticed.</p><p>“They know the fence will stop us, so they won’t even bother with opening fire,” Kentaro said while he kicked the sand, but then he stopped and looked up. “Except…”</p><p>“I don’t like that look. Let me remind you that each and every time you did something after showing that look, you got hurt or someone else got hurt,” Nika reminded his little brother.</p><p>“And yet you never refused to help me with my stupid ideas,” Kentaro reminded him with a knowing smile.</p><p>Nika rolled his eyes on hearing that, but he was unfortunately right. “Then what do I have to do now so that you can go through with whatever weird idea has come to your mind?”</p><p>“Throw me!”</p><p>“Excuse me, what?”</p><p>“It’s easy. You can use your shockwave to give me the height to make it over the fence. I will use my shockwave at the same time so that the impact in between will give me the extra height. I should have thought about this sooner,” Kentaro said and waved at his brother. “Let’s go, I want to kick ass.”</p><p>“Wait, you do realize that we just talked about their weapons, right? And you also thought about the fact that they still have a huge metal gate in front of their Center and you will be trapped between the fence and the gate without any way out.”</p><p>Kentaro stopped for a moment and it seemed like he was rethinking his idea, but then he shrugged his shoulders and started walking. “Let me think about that when I am over the fence.”</p><p>With a sigh Nika followed him as he already knew that he wouldn’t be able to change his mind. “How the hell did you even survive until now?”</p><p>“By having people watching my back, the same as now,” Kentaro said with a bright smile over his shoulder this time and Nika couldn’t even be angry at him anymore.</p><p>“They really don’t even waste the energy on firing at us,” Kentaro said, almost pouting as the Center didn’t even react to them walking up to the fence.</p><p>“Then let’s hope they are distracted enough for you to come up with a good plan after this,” Nika said while Kentaro finally seemed to think about what to do after his idea, but what he hadn’t seen coming was Nika grabbing him by the back of his shirt and throwing him up.</p><p>“Wait, I didn’t say I’m-”</p><p>Before Kentaro could complain that he wasn’t ready, Nika had used his shockwave, forcing Kentaro to turn in the air to use his own against it if he didn’t want to actually get hurt instead of getting over the fence. He almost touched the fence on the highest part, but still landed gracefully on the other side, but he immediately turned to his brother with an outstretched arm. “I take everything back. You don’t have my back. What the hell?”</p><p>“You should better worry about your own back,” Nika teased as he slowly retreated from the fence while Kentaro heard the sound of the weapons getting redirected at him.</p><p>“Great,” Kentaro growled and got ready to dash to the walls so that the weapons couldn’t aim for him, but then he heard the siren of the main gate opening and now even Nika was a bit confused, but he was still outside the fence, which wouldn’t open and alone he wouldn’t make it over.</p><p>The boy who stepped out of the gate was dressed in white, with only his boots being black. His haircut could almost be called boring and so was his look. As if someone had forced him to come here in the first place he walked up to Kentaro with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“I was nice and didn’t attack, yet you had to get on my nerves. What an idiot would jump over the fence in the first place?”</p><p>“Oh, my apologies, did I wake up our Elite Teenager from his beauty nap? You might want to go back in and fix your hair, it seems like you didn’t curl your oh so fabulous violet strand in the back, little prince.”</p><p>On Kentaro’s mocking, Taiko walked up to him and while Kentaro was on high alert he didn’t attack yet, especially because Taiko had both hands in his pockets until he stopped right in front of Kentaro. When he pulled one hand out and held it over Kentaro’s head, the Fallen raised an eyebrow. “Who do you call little, tiny Fallen?”</p><p>This time Kentaro lunged out for the other one, while Nika had actually chuckled from the distance, but he could get his scolding later. Taiko didn’t go on distance though and grabbed Kentaro’s arm. “Together you would have stood a chance, but alone you are no match for me.”</p><p>The warning made Nika tense, Kentaro on the other hand was still annoyed enough to take his chances. He had a close combat special ability he could use on the boy so he tried to grab him with his free hand, yet he didn’t make it in time.</p><p>Different from Nika’s or Myuto’s pain infliction, it only took a split second. It went so fast, so silent that Kentaro didn’t even scream out. Taiko released him, which showed that he could most likely only use his special ability for a split second, but that was enough to cause a lot of damage.</p><p>Kentaro had jolted, but then he had stopped moving and Nika was on high alert, but he didn’t dare to get closer and he couldn’t do anything from outside the fence anyway. When Kentaro fell to his knees with a painful cough and held his chest, Nika made a step to the front, unable to understand the boy’s special ability. Even with Kentaro’s ability it would take a longer time to cause that much damage, yet Kentaro felt like he had barely survived a heart attack.</p><p>“Electricity?” Kentaro let out, gritting his teeth as he got back up on shaking legs.</p><p>“Indeed,” Taiko said and lifted his hand. “An electric shock which can stop your heart. Not many survive the second shock.”</p><p>That warning had Kentaro jump back when Taiko approached him once more, but his own movements hurt his body a lot.</p><p>“You can also jump into the fence if you want, that might be less painful,” Taiko teased.  </p><p>“You can crawl back into your Center, because trust me I will pay you back for that pain,” Kentaro hissed, but then they heard the sound of the Center gate closing and when Taiko turned to the gate with a confused look, Kentaro started laughing. “Oh you are so damn screwed now.”</p><p>“I don’t need Vestige or Chasers as back up,” Taiko said, but Kentaro smirked at him.</p><p>“Not if you are up against only me, but as you said, against both of us you might be in trouble.”</p><p>“But you idiot jumped in here on your own, so no matter if the gate is open or closed, the fence-”</p><p>Exactly that fence also started the warning sirens and a green light lit up when the gate of the fence opened.</p><p>“Yes, what was that about the fence?” Kentaro mocked while Nika walked up to the fence, but still had his eyes on the weapons. It could be a trick, yet they also hoped that it meant Chaka had somehow kept his cover until now and made the others believe in him.</p><p>“You know I don’t really like it when people hurt my little brother,” Nika threatened as he stopped behind Taiko who was now forced to look forth and back between the two Fallen.</p><p>“This is going to be an amazing payback fight,” Kentaro chirped before he dashed to the front at the same time Nika moved as well.</p>

  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>Taisuke hadn’t even bothered with shouting anything as he was sure that the Main Center wouldn’t easily react to him, so he had to try and find out if they really let Taiga die or not. After all Juri had come up with the lie that he had lost Taiga in the middle of the battle against Taisuke’s Fallen troop so it made sense that they had him hostage and the Main Center still thought that Taiga was a normal Chaser.</p><p>The instinct helped Taiga a lot to fake the attacks Taisuke used on him, but he also had to take in some real attacks or it wouldn’t actually look like Taisuke was aiming to kill him.</p><p>Taisuke started running out of ideas after he was sure that Taiga wouldn’t heal fast enough if he kept going, but he was already standing on his rib cage, his bones ready to break.</p><p>With a flick of his tongue Taisuke pulled Taiga up by the hair and got ready to drag him back with him. It would make sense to not let a hostage behind or kill him, if he thought he could still be of use later. Yet Taiga grabbed the other one’s wrist and Taisuke forced his instinct down so that Taiga could communicate with him inside his mind.</p><p>It took a lot of effort to not widen his eyes, yet Taisuke succeeded in staying calm, but the tight grip he gave Taiga on the wrist in return, showed the younger one that he wasn’t agreeing to his idea, yet it was their best shot, if Taiga survived his own idea that was, because his instinct wouldn’t protect him from what was coming.</p><p>Instead of retreating, Taisuke pulled Taiga closer towards the fence before he forced Taiga to stand in front of him. With a tight grip he took him by the neck, Taiga struggling for air while Taisuke looked over the two fences at the security cameras with a lopsided sneer.</p><p>“If you don’t want him back alive, then you can at least take care of his corpse.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes grew wide in his fake play as Taisuke used a shockwave to push him right into the high electricity fence. Taiga’s body jolted on the shock and then he fell to the ground, motionless.</p><p>Taisuke formed a satisfied expression before he turned and walked away without wasting his time on Taiga. Yet he wanted to check if he was still alive or not, because that electricity was able to kill even a Fallen if they touched it for too long and now Taiga was on his own and even wounded. If they found him unconscious and realized that he was a Fallen now, then he was in even bigger danger than Juri and Kochi.</p><p>Yet all Taisuke could do for now was trying to activate his instinct and feel the other one’s presence, as he was sure he wouldn’t be able to do so if the other one was dead. Yet something felt different from usual and in his confusion Taisuke almost stopped, but then forced himself to keep going, because what had just happened in his mind wasn’t a bad sign, at least not for him. Now he was at least sure that Taiga was still alive, if he had died he wouldn’t have forgiven himself and he would have needed to face Hokuto’s rage as well.</p><p>***</p><p>The plan had been to ask and then go, but on his way to speak with Hagi and Reo, there had been some trouble. Big trouble. The moment Aran made it down the corridor, a huge impact had thrown the door of the special observation room across the corridor and Katsuki immediately jumped at Reo who was closer to him after Hagi had avoided getting hit by the door.</p><p>Aran immediately turned to dash to the training room and they had to make sure that Katsuki wouldn’t reach Konpi, yet the Elite-Vestige had obviously already decided to do exactly that as he used his telekinesis to throw Reo right into Hagi before he dashed after Aran.</p><p>“What is going on?” Shintaro was heard as he and Jesse had been alarmed by the noise.</p><p>“Get Konpi into the lab and lock it, NOW,” Aran yelled and decided to turn back around as Katsuki would reach him anyway.</p><p>Jesse immediately ran back to the training room to do as he was told, while Shintaro stepped next to Aran and lifted the bow he had brought, waiting for Katsuki to get into sight. He released the first arrow when the boy came around the corner and yet Aran dashed to the front before it had even reached him. Katsuki waved his hand so that the arrow was thrown back, but Aran dodged it and now Katsuki couldn’t use his ability right away, so Aran was able to get close. Unfortunately Katsuki seemed to have noticed what he was up to and didn’t let him get too close and the shockwave, which they could use from afar was strong enough to throw Aran back, Shintaro catching him before he hit the ground.</p><p>With a hiss Katsuki fell on one knee the next second when Hagi had caught up to him. Reo following as well. “Get back and take care of Konpi,” Hagi yelled and the boys retreated.</p><p>When they made it to the lab, Jesse and a handful of Chasers waited for them already. “Aran, you should go back in as well. It’s risky to have Konpi inside the lab, but definitely even worse to have him out here with Katsuki,” Jesse said. Aran though needed to be somewhere else, but he had no time to explain.</p><p>“I found something that could help us find Juri,” Aran said to make the explanation short.</p><p>“What? But isn’t he in the Main Center with Kochi?” Shintaro asked, but Aran’s pointed look told him that there was no time for questions. “Fine, but whatever it is, you are not going alone.”</p><p>“Shintaro-”</p><p>“I didn’t say you have to stay, I just said I will go with you,” Shintaro said and gave Jesse a knowing look.</p><p>“Don’t worry we will give our best to keep the lab locked and get Katsuki back under control,” Jesse promised.</p><p>“Sorry to put so much pressure on you, but I fear that if we don’t hurry they will relocate and then I don’t know how to find them anymore,” Aran explained.</p><p>“No worries, you can explain everything later, let’s go for now,” Shintaro said.</p><p>***</p><p>Hokuto had been at the Main Center a lot of times already, but never without supervision and a lot of times for the trouble his Fallen self had caused so he didn’t like being back at all.</p><p>Luckily Shime and Noel knew their way around way better and after Hokuto had mind read some people they had knocked out on the way they at least got the information that there was a security room from which they should be able to find out where Juri and Kochi were if they were both really still here, because if Reia had told the truth then something else was going on as well.</p><p>“There is trouble,” Noel shouted and knocked on the security door and a guard came into sight a few seconds later. No Vestige, just a soldier, yet he was of course heavily armed so they still had to watch out. Noel explained some ridiculous scenario that had never happened, but it actually made the guard look alarmed and he looked back at the other person in the room and Noel gave them the signal that there were three people in the room.</p><p>Before the guard could actually alarm other soldiers or Vestige in the Center, Hokuto dashed to the front and jumped on the soldier, mind controlling him to keep him down while Shime had jumped directly into the room together with Noel to knock out the other two.</p><p>“The fact that no one has discovered us yet worries me,” Shime let out as they dragged all the soldiers back into the room while Noel already went through all the security cameras records.</p><p>“It seems too easy, yet I also think they are pretty worried about what is going on at the front gate,” Hokuto added, while he was of course also worried and that was when he realized that now they could actually have a look and he searched for a security camera at the front gate and when he found it he recognized a familiar face.</p><p>“They send out Reia all by himself?” Hokuto realized, but that wasn’t his main worry after he had realized that there was no fight. Myuto and Taisuke were nowhere to be seen and Taiga was lying on the ground next to the fence, motionless.</p><p>“Seems like they had to be pretty ruthless to actually get a reaction out of them in the first place,” Shime said.</p><p>“Ruthless is the only thing Taisuke can be,” Hokuto replied, but immediately gave Shime an apologizing look. It was still difficult for him to see Taisuke the same way as Myuto’s group.</p><p>“Found him,” Noel interrupted them and they concentrated back on their own task, because now that Reia was busy, it was their best shot to actually get Kochi out. “Section A1. But I don’t get it, why are they keeping him all alone in an interrogation room? He seems completely fine.”</p><p>“Isn’t this a bit too easy as well? I somehow feel like either all of this is a distraction or there is really something we don’t know about at all,” Shime said as he found the monitor Noel was looking at. A room the same as their special observation room, Kochi sitting at a desk with his arms crossed to his chest. No one was with him and it didn’t seem like they had tortured him or anything. So why had they brought him here in the first place?</p><p>“Let’s get ready for an ambush or other problems on the way, but let’s not waste time,” Hokuto ordered and they started moving.</p><p>***</p><p>The few minutes Taiga got to actually recover from the impact on the fence went by way too fast and he had almost lost consciousness in between, but then he could hear the sirens of the main gate and then of the fence. But there was only one person, yet Taiga knew already that it was a Vestige, because he couldn’t feel his presence, only hear his steps.</p><p>He used the moment in which the other one stood silently in front of him to actually make more use of his presence finding now that he was closer to the Main Center and the first person he found was Kochi, so at least they hadn’t come for nothing. The instinct helped him to get a bigger radius to use, but while he also found Noel already close to Kochi’s location, he was confused to feel two faint presences away from the Main Center. They shouldn’t even be close to this area, yet they were moving to another location, what were they up to?  </p><p>Taiga tensed when someone crouched down right next to him and as much as he wanted to trust his instinct and just pretend that he was too hurt to even move, it was exactly that instinct which told him to move and look up before the other one was able to reach out for him.</p><p>“Oh, what a surprise and here I thought I came out to pick up a corpse.”</p><p>Was it the lack of reaction on his face? The empty eyes? Of course the memories were Taiga’s and not his own, yet it felt so wrong to not see the boy react to Taiga’s presence.</p><p>“Reia…”</p><p>“Oh? You know who I am? An even bigger surprise,” the boy said, but this time he didn’t make any attempt to get closer. He got up and scanned the area, but with the dust clearing after the explosions, Myuto and Taisuke wouldn’t be able to easily sneak up on him.</p><p>“So you don’t know me?” Taiga asked as he tried to sit up, but his body was still shaking and he also had to pretend to be more wounded than he actually was or his cover would be immediately blown.</p><p>“Kyomoto Taiga, a Chaser at the West Center, half a year training and only one year Chaser experience. The ace Chaser of your Center. Yet my data showed you with black hair, I wonder since when the Centers allow you to change your hair colors?” Reia said, leaving him speechless, but what else had he expected? If Reia still remembered him then he would have come to the West Center before. Which meant that whatever was new about the serum of the Elite-Vestige transition caused the same kind of memory loss some of the Fallen had gone through, but for now it could also be to their advantage. The hair color change on the other hand was something they hadn’t been able to do anything about in their hurry so he tried to just drop the topic, hoping Reia wouldn’t get too suspicious.</p><p>“Did you hear back from Juri and Hokuto?” Taiga asked instead, trying to fake as much as he could about the current situation. “Are they okay?”</p><p>“Right, you got captured by Taisuke,” Reia said, as if it was just a normal fact and nothing special for a Chaser to actually make it back alive.</p><p>“I can give you information about their hideout,” Taiga said as he finally tried to get up and he was healed enough to actually succeed, but he still pretended to not be able to get up just yet. “I don’t have the exact location, but maybe I can help out a bit more if Hokuto gets into my head? Maybe there are a few memories I cannot access myself,” Taiga tried to make Reia focus back on the Main Center to maybe get him access to it.</p><p>“Right, what a coincidence that Hokuto is also at the Main Center right now, isn’t it?”</p><p>Taiga’s expression froze on the spot when Reia gave him a pointed look. “That’s great. But why is he here? Is he hurt? Or is it his Fallen self? Is Juri here too?”</p><p>Taiga had barely made the turn to not react too confused, because usually it wouldn’t even be such a big deal if they were here.</p><p>“Actually, yes, Juri was here earlier too, but guess what, he is not here anymore.”</p><p>Now Reia was playing with him and it was difficult to say how much Reia had already realized. The fact that he realized that Hokuto and the others had made it into the Center showed that something wasn’t going the right way. Why had he bothered coming out and why was he talking with him while the others were on the best way to free Kochi and why wasn’t Juri in the Main Center anymore?”</p><p>“Then Juri is back at the West Center? Maybe I can return with Hokuto later? After a few check ups, because I doubt I can get up easily yet,” Taiga lied once more, but this time Reia formed a smile and moved closer to Taiga once more.</p><p>“You know, I would have believed you a lot of your lies, but guess what,” Reia said as he leant down to Taiga with a lopsided smile as he whispered next to his ear. “A human would have died on the spot after landing in the fence as I made sure to turn up the voltage as high as the second fence.”</p><p>The movement was as fast as his own, just through the instinct Taiga was able to jump back in time before Reia could reach out for him and something told him that Reia had a special ability connected to a touch on the face, similar to himself, so he needed to stay on distance, because even his instinct gave him warning signals about that ability.</p><p>“Not even a Vestige, interesting,” Reia said as if he had known everything right from the start and most likely he had or at least he had good guesses. “Then what is the story? Did Taisuke turn you into a Fallen?”</p><p>So he indeed didn’t know everything yet. They had their assumptions about Kochi and the West Center, yet the details still remained a secret.</p><p>“I can explain it all, but not if I have to fear getting attacked or imprisoned by you Elite-Vestige. The West Center doesn’t want to cause uproar, but you need to let us explain.”</p><p>“Still trying to fight with logic? Now I wonder what exactly you are? That is no Fallen behavior, yet you are obviously no Vestige, it was definitely a good idea to distract the others with Kochi.”</p><p>“What?” Taiga asked, his eyes growing wide. Now everything slowly made sense, but he couldn’t let the others know. Yet something told him that Aran had maybe caught up already, which meant he had to let Myuto know somehow and also Hokuto.</p><p>“Kochi might be the mastermind behind a lot of things going on at the West Center, but the Vestige are the ones we can control so starting our investigation with Juri and Hokuto is the easier plan, yet you are definitely our most interesting discovery for now. Not to forget that Hokuto is difficult to control without the microchip.”</p><p>Taiga immediately left all his caution behind and let his instinct take enough control to use his telepathy. He needed to let Hokuto know that they had to get out before they could get trapped and then he had to let Myuto know about Aran.</p><p>The mess in his own mind made a headache take over when he used his telepathy and something he had slightly felt a few moments before after hitting the fence was causing uproar inside his own ability. Instead of his direct link it felt like his mind was pulling him towards two directions and he gasped on the realization of what had happened.</p><p>While he was feeling shocked about what he had just discovered he also felt excited, but he knew that for Taiga this was something that shouldn’t have happened. It made everything even worse for the boy and that was the least his Fallen self wanted, yet for himself it was a new established connection he felt more than excited about and he could feel that it had actually come from the other one out of worry when he had come up with his improvised fence move.</p><p>The uproar in his mind almost distracted him from his fight, but his instinct was active so he was able to dodge Reia’s shockwave, yet he looked a bit confused as the shockwave had come from the distance. “Interesting. You Elite-Vestige are indeed a new level of annoying.”</p><p>“Now you talk like a Fallen,” Reia said with a bit more excitement this time. “Then show me if you also fight like one.”</p><p>Of course he would, no matter if it was Reia or not. He wasn’t going to kill him, but he needed to keep him busy while sending out his warnings.</p><p>***</p><p>Matsuku had tried to kick Rinne off him when the boy threatened to actually stab him in the chest after Mitsu and the others hadn’t stayed down and kept attacking the Chasers.</p><p>“Leave him alone. We are part of the Centers too, you are a traitor for what you are doing,” Umi shouted and for the first time he actually got the attention of the other Chasers through his yelling.</p><p>Moro and Yuma were busy with two Vestige who had joined the Chasers fight, but now they had also tensed and it was clear that no matter what Rinne had told them, they couldn’t see their own Vestige and Chaser as traitors. There was still a chance to turn the fight around, but Mitsu couldn’t say or do much as they wouldn’t just believe a Fallen.</p><p>“We did not betray you,” Matsuku said now as well. “If you think that trying to make peace with our enemy is betrayal then yes we did something you Elite-Vestige can’t handle.”</p><p>“Make peace with whom? The Fallen? Don’t make me laugh,” Rinne replied. “Aren’t they right here? Didn’t you listen to him? They don’t care about your life.”</p><p>That was it, their chance!</p><p>“Moro, Yuma!” Mitsu yelled over to them and both immediately understood. The Vestige and Chasers had listened to their conversation and hadn’t attacked and now the Fallen lowered their guard and stepped back, a move that left all the South Center members in huge confusion.</p><p>“What are you idiots doing? Attack!” Rinne shouted at them and kicked Matsuku to try to get him to shut up.</p><p>“We won’t attack if you stay out of it. The only one we are after is him,” Mitsu explained and pointed at Rinne.   </p><p>“Well what a shame that I am in charge of this Center so you will have to go through all of them to get to me,” Rinne mocked them and let off Matsuku and faced Mitsu instead.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Mitsu asked and dared to make a step to the front and to Rinne’s obvious shock the Chasers in front of him stepped out of the way.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing? Everyone who does not listen to my command will be treated as traitors,” Rinne shouted at them, but the next moment the Chasers next to Umi actually cut the boy’s hands free and Rinne realized that his plan hadn’t worked out.</p><p>“Fine, then retreat if you want, but I warn you, get into my way and I will treat you as the same enemy they are,” Rinne warned them and faced Mitsu with a murderous glare.</p><p>The Vestige in front of Moro and Yuma also finally stepped back, making it possible for the other two to join Mitsu while Umi hurried to get to Matsuku. They all still seemed tense and would definitely rejoin the fight if they saw the need for it. But they were obviously fed up with Rinne’s arrogance and wanted to decide from the sideline who to trust.</p><p>Mitsu lifted his hand to stop Rinne’s movement, but then the boy was gone. Without a warning he had disappeared and all three of them were left dumbfounded until Umi was heard gasping.</p><p>The Elite Vestige had appeared right behind him while he had tried to free Matsuku from the chains.</p><p>“UMI,” Matsuku shouted and ripped his hands free from the loose chains, but when he tried to attack Rinne, the boy disappeared again, leaving Umi falling right into his arms after Rinne had stabbed him in the back with a knife from Umi’s belt.</p><p>“Told you that I will treat traitors the same as them,” Rinne laughed before he faced Mitsu. “Good luck trying to use any ability on me. I doubt you will be fast enough to catch me.”</p><p>“Teleportation?” Moro whispered, but Yuma shook his head.</p><p>“Most likely just a pretty fast movement, but it looks like teleportation. Now we just have to find out if there is a limit or weakness to it.”</p><p>“What a shame that there isn’t,” Rinne laughed as he disappeared once more and Mitsu knew that now they had to fight for their own lives as he didn’t seem to need much recharge time.</p><p>***</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” Senga yelled after Yabana had stopped him from attacking with another acoustic wave, but this time Yokoo had been fast enough to avoid it. Yet Yabana had just decided to jump off the roof instead.</p><p>“Let’s just make sure he doesn’t get away,” Yokoo said and helped Senga up. “As long as he only keeps playing around like this we won’t get into trouble.</p><p>“And here all I want is my fist on that brat’s face,” Senga complained before he also dashed to the side of the roof and jumped, knowing that they had to make sure that the boy wasn’t opening the fence to actually run away.</p><p>Yokoo decided to take the stairs in case Yabana tried to make Senga chase him back up to the roof once more. On his way some Chasers got in his way and even though he felt a bit sorry he knocked a few out and blinded two.</p><p>The next Chaser who came into his sight was not a threat, but he was obviously on the run and he almost crushed into Yokoo who stopped him on the shoulders. “Having trouble?”</p><p>“I wonder if it isn’t the better choice to fight Yabana,” Shizu said. “I can at least hurt him, I don’t want to hurt Chasers I’ve worked with until now, but they won’t listen.”</p><p>“Just keep running, Yabana does the same at the moment,” Yokoo said and patted the boy’s shoulder before he went down the other side of the corridor.</p><p>“Wait, so you won’t help me?” Shizu asked, but then he heard the shouting of his fellow Chasers.</p><p>“Good luck,” Yokoo said and raised his arm, before he vanished into the next corridor.</p>
