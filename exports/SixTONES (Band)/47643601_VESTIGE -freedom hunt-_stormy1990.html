      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The West Center had taken a huge risk by trying to find a way to get the Fallen on their side instead of hunting them down the way the Government ordered them to. Through which they eventually ended up in their biggest battle on two fronts. While the battle against the strongest Fallen group they had met so far seemed to be finally over, the Main Center had now laid eyes on them for keeping secrets from them.<br/>While Taisuke and the Fallen following him were now no danger to them anymore and Hokuto hoped that this chapter was finally over, it was a different story for Taiga as he still shared the instinct with Taisuke. An ongoing dangerous connection, which would force him to an emotional limit as his personal wishes didn’t match what the instinct wanted him to focus on.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Here we finally go wit the 3rd part of this series! One more to go after this!<br/>New characters and new chaos is on the way.</p><p>Hope you will enjoy reading^^/<br/>(as always be prepared for grammar/spelling mistakes and plot holes)</p></blockquote>

</p><p>The chaos was at its peak that was for sure. It had been a secret to all other Centers that the West Center was trying to rescue the Fallen and use their self-made Reserve serum to give them their access to emotions back, which finally ended the civil war between Vestige and Fallen. Yet it was questionable if the Government would accept it the same way as the West Center members did? Before they could even decide if and how to tell the Main Center about their discovery, things had gotten out of control after they had finally succeeded in bringing Taisuke’s group on their side.</p><p>A group of Elite-Vestige from the Main Center had suddenly taken control of the remaining Centers, making it impossible for the Fallen to return to the West Center. Shime’s group of non-center bound Vestige and Chasers made it out to the remaining Centers to gather information while Hokuto went to the West Center to see how the situation was. Yet it was a risky plan, also involving Reo, a Fallen that could easily be taken by the Elite-Vestige.</p><p>Yet hidden in the mountains there was still a way bigger fight going on. Taiga’s Fallen self was struggling with his instinct and while he tried his best to stay in control it wasn’t making the situation easier that Taisuke who shared that instinct was now on their side. Myuto tried to not be too protective, yet he also knew that Hokuto only chose to go to the Center, because he trusted Myuto with taking care of Taiga, yet he had already broken that promise without being aware of it.</p><p>There were secrets on all sides, a lot of questions that needed to be answered and with the appearance of someone Taiga and Myuto had thought all these years of as dead, things had gotten even more complicated. Now they had to find out why the leader of the Elite-Vestige was the orphan boy they had protected for years, Reia!</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 28 - February</strong>
</p><p>“So you cannot open it, is that what you want to say?” Konpi asked and raised an eyebrow after Hokuto had been trying to open the lab for quite some time now, but luck was on his side that he indeed had no clue how Kochi’s auto-lock worked.</p><p>“I fear if you want it to open, then you have to bring Kochi back. By the way, would you finally enlighten me about what is going on? As I told you everything was like always when we left, so what happened?”</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said coldly, before he waved at him to follow him down the corridor. “The lab can wait for later. They will bring Kochi back after the Main Center had a talk with him.”</p><p>“Who do you even mean with they? Who are you guys?” Hokuto finally lost his calm a bit and stopped, crossing his arms to his chest.</p><p>“We introduced ourselves earlier, remember?” Konpi replied in his annoying teasing manner.</p><p>“Then who are those others?” Hokuto asked as he turned to Konpi and the boy flicked his tongue, which annoyed Hokuto even more as he wasn’t in the mood to argue with two stupid teenagers.</p><p>“The Main Center put us in charge, so the Main Center is also under our order at the moment. You can’t tell us that you haven’t heard of us Elite-Vestige yet?” Katsuki replied instead and Hokuto had of course heard of them, but that didn’t make the situation any easier. A special generation of Vestige with extremely strong abilities and characteristics close to the Fallen and now their snappy attitude also made sense.</p><p>“And that means you have to listen to what we are saying and for now we want to talk to your little Fallen friend,” Konpi added with a lopsided smile.</p><p>“Fine, then go on,” Hokuto said and shrugged his shoulders. They had made sure to come up with a detailed fake story so that all of them had the same information from the moment Juri and Hokuto ‘fake’ departed from the Center. So no matter if they talked to Reo or Jesse and Shintaro, they should be fine, as long as none of them had mind reading abilities.</p><p>When they kept walking down the corridor, Hokuto dared to look up at one of the security cameras as he walked behind the others. He needed to know if he was right, but he didn’t know how to ask for a sign, yet he didn’t need to anymore as the camera moved just a tiny little bit to the left and that was all Hokuto had needed. Aran was in the lab! He was in full control of the Center’s security system and that made things a bit easier for Hokuto. Yet they had to find out if the Elite-Vestige had any special abilities and if it was a smart move to actually try to fight against them or if it was better to just wait. But somehow Hokuto was concerned about the situation at the Main Center so he needed to contact Shime and Noel as fast as he could.</p><p>***</p><p>“What the hell was that sudden rain,” Hagi complained as he made it down the ladder to the main floor of the hideout. His clothes were drained completely and he immediately threw his jacket and shirt into one of the corners, not wanting to take even more water into the hideout.</p><p>“Just wait until tomorrow, who knows if the weather will give us a heat stroke next or a blizzard,” Taiga complained as he took his long blonde strands into a ponytail to get the water out a bit.</p><p>Even before the war the weather had started to change and humanity had failed in keeping climate change under control. There was nothing like a four season weather anymore and it was never clear what kind of weather would follow next. Even the oceans were sometimes boiling up, then freezing cold. But if they wanted to get it under control they had to first end the war, not that they felt like it actually had an end.</p><p>“Damn, what I would give for a hot shower now,” Hagi complained, but Taisuke’s hideout didn’t have that kind of luxury. “I will grab some spare clothes. Yokoo told me where they keep them. Wait here so that we don’t flood the whole place.”</p><p>Taiga nodded gratefully as he remained in the entrance area. It had gotten colder with the heavy rain and even though Fallen and Vestige weren’t that affected by it, the time they had needed to make it back to the hideout from their patrol had made Taiga start shivering nevertheless. He put his hands up to his arms to rub a bit of warmth into them, but once more the water from his hair got in his way and he turned back to the entrance to get more water out of his hair so that it wouldn’t run down his face.</p><p>When something was thrown over his head he wanted to scold Hagi for throwing the dry clothes at him as they would just get wet like that, but when he turned around, a hand landed on the fabric and rubbed it over the boy’s hair. “Even Fallen can catch a cold and you are on the best way to it.”</p><p>It hadn’t been clothes, but a towel and it hadn’t been Hagi, but Taisuke. While everything told Taiga to step back, to take the other one’s hand away and use the towel by himself, he just couldn’t do it as his look went up to the older one’s face.</p><p>How could he look so calm? So gentle? They had tried to kill each other just days ago, their instincts battling each other too desperately to live alongside each other. Yet the instinct was making their lives even more complicated now or at least for Taiga, because Taisuke seemed to totally enjoy taking care of the other one. Not that it would stay that harmless and Taiga knew that of course, yet again he just didn’t move away.</p><p>“Hagi said he will bring spare clothes,” Taiga let out, not even knowing why his voice sounded so shy.</p><p>“Great, then you can get out of these,” Taisuke said and reached out for the other one’s jacket, pulling it down his shoulders and when Taisuke stepped a bit too close, Taiga finally made a step back and got out of the jacket by himself. Taisuke of course realized the change, but he couldn’t do more than show him an apologizing reaction. It was obvious how much he tried to not let things escalate again like the other night, but who were they kidding? It was impossible.</p><p>“Here, take the towel. You should definitely get out of that shirt,” Taisuke said and held the towel towards him. Taiga didn’t take it right away and finally got rid of his shirt for now. As he reached out to grab the towel, his hand landed half on Taisuke’s and once more he felt how he behaved so damn stupid. Instead of taking the towel, he grabbed the other one’s hand and Taisuke dared to step closer again and lifted the towel up to the boy’s hair once more with a soft touch.</p><p>The sound of a door opening right behind Taisuke made Taiga almost jump to the back and Taisuke turned towards the person stepping out.</p><p>“Oh, finally awake? How are you feeling?” Taisuke somehow was able to bring out.</p><p>Juri’s look turned from slightly disorientated to fully confused in seconds. He had no idea where he was or how the battle had ended, but the picture in front of him seemed even more confusing to him. Slowly Taisuke took down the towel he somehow still held awkwardly in the air, while Taiga crossed his arms to his exposed upper body with a weird hawk.</p><p>“Hey Taiga, I could only- oh, Juri! And- ehm what is going on here?” Hagi asked, obviously as confused as Juri, but also a bit scolding as he of course had been told to have an eye on Taiga, yet it seemed like Taisuke always showed up when they weren’t around for a second.</p><p>“Guys, give me a break,” Juri complained, rubbing his temples, obviously still in pain, which was understandable after all the impacts he had taken in. “I will go back to my room until you solve whatever this is and then can someone please explain to me what happened? And I mean the important stuff, thanks.”</p><p>With a hand movement at Taiga and Taisuke when talking about ‘this’, Juri went back straight to his room and closed the door as if nothing had happened. Meanwhile Hagi finally walked up to Taiga and pressed some clothes against his chest. He had changed already and gave Taisuke a look over his shoulder now.</p><p>“Right, I will tell the others that Juri woke up,” Taisuke said and when he entered the lab a heavy silence lay between Hagi and Taiga.</p><p>“Do I need to worry?” Hagi asked, but instead of feeling guilty, there was anger rising inside Taiga. He grabbed the shirt with an annoyed click of his tongue, leaving Hagi even more speechless.</p><p>“No you don’t and Myuto also doesn’t have to,” Taiga replied, which meant as much as no need to even tell Myuto. “I will talk to Juri.”</p><p>Without giving Hagi the chance to reply, Taiga headed towards the boy’s room, but he also felt sorry, because his own anger wasn’t Hagi’s fault. It was all because of the instinct. Now that it didn’t have to fight anymore, it just put up a wall to protect his and Taisuke’s emotions and it was as difficult to control as the urge to rip the other one apart.</p><p>***</p><p>“Why do you waste your time? If you want to know anything, look at that oh so awesome Vestige behind you. His mind reading ability will definitely tell you everything you need to know.”</p><p>Reo’s snappy attitude had even Hokuto taken aback as he behaved even more fiercely than he had back when he was indeed still their enemy. But it was obvious that even for Reo it was easier to play it this way than in his usual fun way.</p><p>“Did you use your mind reading on him already?” Katsuki asked and Hokuto nodded. He still leaned back at the metal door of their special observation room, for the first time really used on a Fallen, not that Reo would try to break out of it. Which would also not be that simple, because even with the lab shut down, the special observation room had a special security system as a backup which could be used right from the outside of the room. But that didn’t mean that Aran couldn’t take control of the room if he wanted to.</p><p>Hokuto had already told them the fake story about how they had captured him with his mind control and that he needed to be chained down, because of his illusion ability. Now exactly that had happened and Reo played with the chains, which were connected to two metal hooks in the ground, while Katsuki was standing in front of his chair and Konpi was sitting on one of the tables with an annoyed expression.</p><p>“We found out where their hideout is located, but when Juri went over to check on it, they had already abandoned it.”</p><p>“That reminds me, where is your transmitter?” Katsuki asked, but then Reo let out an annoyed sound and threw his head to the back.</p><p>“You know I feel like you interrogate him more than me. Would you mind and get lost if you want to waste his time instead?”</p><p>This time Konpi got up from the table and Hokuto bit the inside of his cheek when the boy lifted his leg and gave Reo a harsh kick to the stomach and left his leg up on the other one’s upper body as he leant down to him. Reo gave him a death glare and yanked on the chains, but picking a fight was no option for him.</p><p>“But like this it’s more fun,” Konpi said and pulled something out of his pocket and while Reo had no clue what it was, Hokuto’s eyes grew wide as he stepped away from the door.</p><p>“Why do you have that?” Hokuto asked, his voice not as steady as he wanted it to be.</p><p>“We have access to almost everything as Elite-Vestige and as we knew that you are in this Center we made sure to bring it,” Konpi said as he used unnecessary force to push himself away from Reo resulting with another angry glare from the Fallen.</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter, right?” Konpi asked, as he waved the remote control in front of Hokuto’s face. “We heard a lot of stories about you. But as calm as you are I am sure we are not talking to your Fallen self, right?”</p><p>Of course the Main Center had been still kept in the dark about Hokuto’s and Taiga’s transitions as well as all the other Fallen related news, yet this was the worst they could have brought with them. Because what if the remote suddenly worked? Now he was a Vestige, it was going to work, right? They would find out!</p><p>Hokuto’s panic got the best of him and he remained completely silent, which made Katsuki walk up to him with a skeptical look.</p><p>“We heard that in fights your Fallen self would take over, but you captured Reo without it?”</p><p>That question made Reo laugh so that they turned back to him, giving Hokuto a moment to get himself back together.</p><p>“You forget that Hokuto’s Fallen self can use his abilities as well. He is an asshole I can tell you that, but helping you guys out just to mock us, is something he also loves doing. He feels superior.”</p><p>“I would say he is, because now you are here and he is still with Hokuto,” Konpi mocked the other one.</p><p>“Is he?” Katsuki asked as he turned back to Hokuto, but this time the other one had gotten his act up again.</p><p>“I wish I could tell you that I was able to get rid of him, but unfortunately the Main Center didn’t come up with something until now and Kochi didn’t either, so I fear you have to live with the chance that he will show up if you go on my nerves too much.”</p><p>Konpi laughed on that, already looking forward to actually facing the Fallen self not knowing that for that he would need to meet Taiga now. “What a shame, then this thing is just a useless toy this time.”</p><p>Even though Konpi had said so, his finger went right to one of the buttons on it and Hokuto froze, ready to experience severe pain, yet nothing happened…</p><p>“Boring,” Konpi said as he put the remote back into his pocket.</p><p>“Do Elite-Vestige not have a microchip or why do you think it’s ok to just ‘try out’ if mine works?” Hokuto asked, trying to calm down his racing heartbeat.</p><p>“No need for you to know,” Katsuki said as he gave Reo another look. “For now I think we won’t get anything out of him, so let’s discuss how we proceed from here. We need to report to the Main Center.”</p><p>Hokuto was grateful for the break he would get, but he also wanted to know why the remote wasn’t working, not that it was his priority to find out. For now they had to make a plan, which was difficult with them not being able to talk to each other. But maybe Aran could somehow help them to get Katsuki and Konpi out of the way long enough to come up with something. But for now Hokuto needed to know more about them and their special abilities before he could make any kind of plan.</p><p>***</p><p>"Okay, then I guess I should wait just a bit longer until I head back too," Juri concluded after getting a brief explanation from Taiga and of course the boy had left out all the stuff about Taisuke. Now they were in the lab with Myuto, Kentaro, Senga and Yokoo. But of course Juri could feel Myuto's eyes on Taiga.</p><p>"Yes, I think we should wait until we get a reply from Hokuto. As long as we don't know what is going on at the West Center I don't think you should head there too."</p><p>Myuto was right, but Juri was also feeling restless. He had gotten all the fake stories from the others, but for now he wanted to rest some more.</p><p>"Give me until the morning and I'll help you with your patrols, okay?" Juri said and of course everyone agreed and Juri excused himself for now.</p><p>"Guess we should also get ready. The others should be back soon," Kentaro said and it was obvious that all he wanted to do was to actually get out and find his brother. It was getting complicated to have Kentaro on a team without him, not that anyone could blame him.</p><p>"Taiga and I will go," Myuto announced on which Kentaro pouted, but when Hagi told him that they would go for the next one, Taiga knew that this was no random patrol and he sighed but headed to the door.</p><p>They walked in silence for quite a while until they had left the hideout behind them and at a rocky open surface Taiga finally stopped.</p><p>"Hagi told you, didn't he?"</p><p>Of course he had, Myuto was their leader and they were all worried for Taiga.</p><p>"I just want to remind you of our promise to Hokuto. You know that at some point you'll have to let Taiga take over again and he'll definitely ask me to dig out those memories," Myuto explained, but it was obvious that he also didn't want to do so, yet he wouldn't refuse if Taiga asked him. He had taken the dangerous step of letting his Fallen self take over for so long. He deserved to know what had happened, yet it was clear that the aftermath of knowing was going to be heavy.</p><p>"At least they won't be his memories."</p><p>The Fallen self had whispered the words ahead into the forest, but of course Myuto had heard him and when he let out a long breath he could see the breath forming a cloud in the air. It had gotten extremely cold, snow definitely about to fall.</p><p>"Look, I know that for Taiga's sake I have to try hard as well to not give him even worse memories and trust me when I tell you I'm trying."</p><p>Of course he had already failed once, but while it still remained a secret, Myuto obviously had caught up to the fact that something had happened. Yet Myuto didn't seem angry. His look was calm, but the worry for Taiga was obvious.</p><p>"I guess we all have to thank you for what you've done in the end, no matter if you or the instinct decide to do some harmful things in between."</p><p>The snort Taiga let out on hearing that made Myuto crack a smile this time. But he meant what he had said. The Fallen self could have betrayed them at all times, but for Taiga's sake he hadn’t done so.</p><p>"You had offered me a place back then," Taiga said as he looked up into the sky. "At that time I really wanted that place. I wanted my own life and I would have sacrificed Hokuto to get it."</p><p>"But not Taiga," Myuto concluded as he walked away from the other one with his hands in his pockets.</p><p>"Now I'm offered another place,” Taiga said his look a bit absentminded. "But exactly because of this connection I understand now what I would take away from Taiga to get my own happiness."</p><p>It was weird to hear him talk like this, because even though he had gone through a lot of changes through the instinct and two serums, in the end even the Reverse serum wouldn’t turn him as he was only a mindset and his body belonged to Taiga. That was luckily also why he had been able to put up an act with Taisuke before as the original Fallen serum didn’t really had any effect on him as he had always been a full Fallen and only the blood connection had powered up his instinct and had made staying in control a challenge.</p><p>"Then show me how determined you are," Myuto said as he had walked in front of Taiga at some distance and turned towards him with a challenging smile. "Show me what that instinct is capable of."</p><p>The invitation for a fight came as a surprise to Taiga and for a moment he looked startled until he also formed a brief smile and started moving his arms and neck with an exciting expression. "All injuries go on you. I won't hold back."</p><p>"I didn't ask you to," Myuto replied with another teasing smile before they both dashed to the front.</p><p>Being trapped all together in the hideout had caused them all a lot of growing tension so this fight was something they definitely needed. It was also a chance for Taiga to give his instinct a moment of release and try and keep his walls up as best as he could afterwards.</p>
