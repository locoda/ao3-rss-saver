<p>"Please, I can hardly walk," Taiga complains as they walk through the corridor, which has a faint scent of cedar. He lets out a sigh, rubbing his stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi chuckles softly. "You did seem pretty enthusiastic about that last course but forgot about the soup and dessert still coming," he teases.</p><p> </p><p>"I couldn't help it," Taiga groans. "Everything was so good. I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach."</p><p> </p><p>"You say that every time," Kochi says, nudging him lightly. "You'd think you'd learn by now."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, yeah, lecture me later. Right now, I just want to collapse."</p><p> </p><p>They reach their room and slide the door open to reveal the futons that the attentive ryokan staff has laid out. The room is simple yet elegant, with shoji screens and a low wooden table, now cleared of the tea set they had enjoyed earlier. Only one paper lantern lamp is switched on in the corner of the room, and it creates a warm atmosphere in the room that almost invites one into the dream world.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wastes no time but collapses onto one of the futons with a dramatic groan. "I'm so full, I might not be able to move for a week," he exaggerates. He stretches his limbs out like a starfish, his fingers and toes stretching toward the edges of the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi shakes his head, amused, as he kneels down beside the futon. "We could still go to the onsen to bathe," he says. "It might help us digest."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga opens one eye to look at him. "You really think soaking in hot water is going to make me less full?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well, it's worth a try," Kochi says, his fingers fidgeting with the edge of the futon. "And it's supposed to be relaxing."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga keeps stretching out on the futon, letting out a satisfied sigh. The softness of the bedding beneath him and the gentle glow of the paper lantern lamp create such a cozy atmosphere. Kochi, still kneeling beside him, watches with a soft smile.</p><p> </p><p>"You know, I wasn't expecting such a nice evening," Taiga says, his voice warm and appreciative. "This place surely is something special."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's smile grows, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "I'm glad you think so. I was hoping you'd enjoy it."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I'm not the only one enjoying it. You seem pretty comfortable yourself. Tell me, is it this awesome place or just the good company?"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's cheeks flush slightly.</p><p> </p><p>"I'd say it's a bit of both," he says. "You're quite good at making a relaxing evening even better."</p><p> </p><p>"Is that so? And here I was thinking that you'd enjoy this place with basically anyone."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi chuckles softly, leaning in closer. "Maybe I would. But for real. I actually enjoy spending time with you. It's nice to see you relaxed and happy."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart skips a beat at the sincerity in Kochi's voice. He moves so that he's now lying on his stomach, resting his chin against his hand. He stretches out his left hand, resting it casually on Kochi's arm. "Well, I'm glad to hear that. Because I've really enjoyed today, too. You've gone out of your way to make everything perfect."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi looks down at the hand resting on his arm, then back up at Taiga with a soft gaze. "I'm happy to hear that. Sometimes, it's the little things that can make us really happy. Like sharing this moment with you."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's fingers lightly tap against Kochi's arm, and he leans in slightly.</p><p> </p><p>"Speaking of little things," Taiga starts, "I have to admit, I've also been looking forward to spending time like this with you. It's nice to just… be."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's own hand comes to rest lightly over Taiga's and traces the gentle curve of Taiga's fingers. But then his easygoing smile suddenly dims, replaced by a more contemplative expression. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga notices the shift in Kochi's demeanor immediately, and he tilts his head slightly. "What's on your mind?" he asks.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi hesitates, his fingers absently continue tracing patterns on the edge of Taiga's hand. The touch is light but deliberate, and Taiga can feel the delicate brush of Kochi's fingertips sending weird shivers through him. </p><p> </p><p>"I was just-" Kochi begins, then falters.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's expression softens, and he shifts slightly. "It's okay. You can tell me."</p><p> </p><p>"I was just wondering what if—" Kochi starts again, but his voice trails off again. He raises his hand, bringing it to Taiga's cheek and letting his fingers lightly brush against it.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's gaze flickers down, and he bites his lower lip thoughtfully. His gaze is locked onto Taiga's lips. Then he gathers the courage and lets out what he's been about to say. </p><p> </p><p>"What if I told you that I've been thinking about kissing you all evening?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes widen slightly, but his expression softens quickly.</p><p> </p><p>"And what if I told you that I've been hoping you would?"</p><p> </p><p>"Then it looks like we're on the same page."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips curl into a warm smile. "I'd say so."</p><p> </p><p>Then Taiga sits up and grabs Kochi's shoulders before leaning in. Their lips meet in a gentle kiss. </p><p> </p><p>They keep moving their lips against each other, both of them losing themselves in the moment, the world outside their little room fading away. When they finally pull apart, both are breathing a little harder, their faces still staying inches apart.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow," Taiga whispers, his voice slightly shaky. "That was truly an... unexpected turn of tonight's events."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi hums softly, his breath warm against Taiga's mouth. "Yeah. I'm sorry."</p><p> </p><p>"No, don't say sorry. It felt right. And nice."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi smiles, the corners of his eyes crinkling in an adorable way. "I guess the onsen can wait after all," he murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga laughs softly, his hands slipping from Kochi's shoulders along his arms to his hands, fingers intertwining with him. He pulls Kochi beside him on the futon. </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I think we have more important things to do right now."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's hand trembles slightly as they both lie down on the futon, side by side, facing each other. He can feel the heat radiating from Kochi's body.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga leans in, capturing Kochi's lips again in a tender kiss. Their movements are slow and exploratory. There's a sense of familiarity in their touches but also a thrilling newness. They have kissed a few times before, when all of them were present, drunk, and thrilled about their concerts, but this is all different. Everything about this is not just random drunk kissing in a concert afterglow. No, everything about this is so real it almost hurts to think how real it is.  </p><p> </p><p>Kochi's hand slides up to Taiga's cheek, his thumb gently brushing against his skin. Taiga shivers at the touch, his body responding instinctively.</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga," Kochi murmurs against his mouth. "I've wanted this for so long."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart skips a beat. "Me too," he admits, his voice just as soft. "I just didn't know how to say it."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi leans in again, his lips capturing Taiga's in another kiss, this one more urgent, more desperate. Taiga responds with equal enthusiasm, his hands tangling in Kochi's hair. The kiss deepens, their tongues exploring, tasting each other.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's hand moves from Taiga's cheek to his shoulder, then slowly down his arm, stimulating a shiver from Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga pulls back slightly, his eyes searching Kochi's as he fiddles with the knot of his yukata. </p><p> </p><p>"Is this okay?" he asks, his voice husky.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. It's more than okay."</p><p> </p><p>"I've never done this before," Taiga admits. "With a guy, I mean."</p><p> </p><p>"Me neither," Kochi replies. "But we can figure it out together."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nods, feeling a rush of affection filling him after hearing such words. This is why he likes Kochi so much. </p><p> </p><p>They start to undress each other. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's fingers fumble slightly when opening the knot of Kochi's obi, but Kochi remains patient and doesn't urge him to hurry. As he slides the yukata fabric off, Taiga's breath catches at the sight of Kochi's bare skin, illuminated softly by the lantern's glow. Only then Kochi's hands come to Taiga's yukata, opening the knot and eventually slipping the fabric away in the same way as Taiga just did to him. Neither of them has been wearing underwear.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's hands find their way to Taiga's body, exploring the planes of his chest and the dip of his waist. Each touch sends a slight shiver through Taiga, and he responds in kind, his hands roaming over Kochi's skin, committing every inch to memory.</p><p> </p><p>"Tell me if you want us to stop," Taiga murmurs, his lips brushing against Kochi's ear. He kisses his earlobe.</p><p> </p><p>"I will," Kochi promises, his voice a breathless whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Their mouths meet again in a deep and hungry kiss, with the urgency clearly growing between them. Taiga's hand slides down Kochi's body, fingers tracing the contours of his chest and stomach. When his hand finally wraps around Kochi's length, Kochi gasps, his hips bucking slightly in response. Taiga takes his time, his movements slow and deliberate, wanting to savor every reaction he elicits from Kochi.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's hand follows suit, wrapping around Taiga's arousal. They move in sync, their breaths mingling in the small space between them, eyes locked on each other. </p><p> </p><p>"Taiga," Kochi whispers, his voice coming out with a slight gasp. "I <em>want</em> you."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moans at that, the words and how they are said make him so aroused he's sure he's going to explode at any moment. "Are you sure?" he asks, his fingers moving rhythmically along Kochi's length.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi nods, and his eyes glean with need. "Yes. Please."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nods. It feels wrong to get his hands off Kochi, but he needs to stand up and go to the bathroom to get a lube and a condom from his toilet bag.</p><p> </p><p>Once he's back, he motions Kochi to lie down on his back and comes to sit on the futon next to him. Taiga kisses him. Then Taiga pours some lube into his hand, warming it between his palms before rubbing them against his fingers. He reaches down to prepare Kochi.</p><p> </p><p>He starts by circling Kochi's entrance with a slick finger, watching Kochi's face for any signs of discomfort. When Kochi only moans softly and pushes back against the touch, Taiga gently slips a finger inside, feeling the tight heat envelop him.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's breathing quickens, his body adjusting to the intrusion. Taiga takes his time, carefully working his finger in and out, stretching Kochi slowly. He adds a second finger, then a third, scissoring them gently.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's moans grow louder, his hips moving in time with Taiga's fingers. "Taiga, please," he pants, his hands clutching at the futon beneath them.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can't hold back any longer. He withdraws his fingers and snatches the condom package. He opens it and rolls the condom on his hard cock. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga comes to lie on top of Kochi, positioning his cock at the entrance. He looks down at Kochi, their eyes meeting in a moment. Taiga can see trust. </p><p> </p><p>"If it gets uncomfortable, tell me," Taiga says softly.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi nods, his hands gripping Taiga's shoulders for support. "I will. Just... go slow."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga presses forward, the head of his length breaching Kochi's entrance. </p><p> </p><p>The sensation is overwhelming, the tight heat unlike anything he's ever felt. He moves slowly, inch by inch, giving Kochi time to adjust. Kochi's breath hitches, but he doesn't ask Taiga to stop or slow down.</p><p> </p><p>Once he's fully inside Kochi, Taiga pauses, allowing them both to catch their breath. The sensation of being so intimately connected with Kochi is almost too much to bear, but it's also perfect in its intensity.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay?" Taiga asks.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi nods, his eyes closed as he focuses on the feeling. "Yeah. Move, Taiga. Please."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga begins to move, slowly at first, drawing almost all the way out before pushing back in. The friction is exquisite, each thrust feeling so good. Kochi's legs wrap around Taiga's waist, pulling him deeper, urging him to go faster.</p><p> </p><p>Their rhythm builds the sounds of their moans and the slap of skin on skin filling the room. Taiga leans down to capture Kochi's lips in a searing kiss, their bodies moving together in unison. The pleasure builds with each thrust, the intensity of the moment driving them both closer to the edge.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's hand moves to stroke himself in time with Taiga's thrusts, his moans growing louder, more desperate. "Taiga, I'm close," he gasps.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's thrusts grow erratic, his climax approaching rapidly. "Me too," he groans, his hips snapping forward with increasing urgency.</p><p> </p><p>With a final, powerful thrust, Taiga feels Kochi's body tense beneath him, a cry of pleasure escaping his lips as he finds his release. The sight and sound of Kochi coming undone pushes Taiga over the edge, and he follows moments later, his body shuddering with the force of his orgasm.</p><p> </p><p>They collapse together on the futon, their bodies spent and slick with sweat. Taiga pulls out gently, rolling beside Kochi, their breaths heavy and uneven.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi turns his head to look at Taiga, a satisfied smile on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"That was... incredible."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles back at that beautiful smile, feeling a warmth spread through him that has nothing to do with the physical exertion. "Yeah, it was."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga has never been a big hugger, but he can't help himself curl up against Kochi, his head resting on his chest. Kochi's arm wraps around him protectively, holding him close. As they lie there and Kochi's fingers trail lazily over Taiga's skin, Taiga feels a sense of belonging that he's never experienced before.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think... this changes anything?" Taiga asks a bit unsurely, his face still buried against Kochi's chest.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi takes Taiga's hand in his, squeezing it gently. "It changes everything, and yet nothing at all," he replies. "We're still us, still the same members who've always been there for each other. But now, we just experienced something new. And that's a good thing."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles. His heart feels relieved and light because Kochi's words are so right, so true.  </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, you're right. It is a good thing."</p><p> </p><p>After a moment, Kochi chuckles softly. "You know," he starts teasingly, "I'm surprised you didn't break out into singing or something. It feels like one of those moments."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga laughs at that, shaking his head at such a random comment. "Oh, don't tempt me. I've got a whole playlist for moments like this."</p><p> </p><p>"Do you? Are there many 'just made love to my member in a ryokan' theme songs?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga pretends to think for a moment, then grins. "Well, not too many songs exactly like that, but I was thinking about our 'Strawberry Breakfast'? That would be pretty suitable for this moment." </p><p> </p><p>"The 'wake up at 7:30' part?"</p><p> </p><p>"More like 'then after a shower, hold you tight' part!" Taiga chuckles and sits up. "I changed my mind, let's go to the onsen after all. We can't miss that!" </p><p> </p><p>They quickly clean up the mess they've made in bed (and on themselves) and put their yukatas back on.</p><p> </p><p>As they prepare to leave, towels in hand and slippers on, Taiga stops them in the entryway.</p><p> </p><p>"You know," he begins, "I bet people would never believe how well we get along."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh? What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"Well," Taiga continues, "we're such an unexpected combo. I mean, who would've thought we would hit it off like this?"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi laughs, giving Taiga a teasing nudge. "What do you mean, unexpected? We're just as good as any other combo. We've got our own rhythm, and it works for us."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles at that. "True."</p><p> </p><p>Without another word, Taiga leans in, his lips meeting Kochi's in a quick kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Kochi's smile broadens. "If the onsen is half as nice as that kiss, we're in for a treat."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga laughs and gives Kochi's hand a tender squeeze before sliding the door open.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, let's go find out."</p>
