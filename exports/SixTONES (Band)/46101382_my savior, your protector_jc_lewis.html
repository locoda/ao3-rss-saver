      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Jesse Lewis returned from his imprisonment abroad with vengeance in mind when his grandfather finally dies and his hold over him ends. He swore to make every last of his enemies suffer for tearing his nuclear family apart and in the process, Jesse sought out Matsumura Hokumi, who had been the perfect choice for an ally. She was powerful, but isolated. Yet a twist in events changed the way their fates intertwined. Two incomplete people found each other and became each others' protector. A love that is a little toxic, a little broken, but perfect for two people who despite their rage at the world, only ever wanted love.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>There was an eerie full moon that night, illuminating the bayside with more gleam than usual. The sea breeze was strong too, carrying gusts of salt-filled wind across the otherwise barren shipyard, safe for the stacks of metal containers. Two men huddled in a small alley formed by these tall metal containers trying to keep their cigarettes lit on a smoke break. They had been sent by their boss to stake out at the location ahead of time. But they knew the location was secure. The big man paid to make sure it was, and since these two knew they decided to slack off.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear?” The skinnier one of the two asked, “The top boss is overseeing this personally tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>The other one let out a puff of smoke before half-heartedly replying, “What’s so special? Why would his lazy ass come? He never comes.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” The other smirks as though about to spill the world’s juiciest gossip, “You haven’t heard.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>There was usually little question when it came to who the most influential families were in Tokyo. Most people assumed it was either the Kyomotos’ old money or the Matsumuras’ shady businesses, but then they would be wrong. Underneath the guise of their daytime business, the Sato Corp was the true rising empire–and everything on the surface was merely the tip of the iceberg. People in the business knew. They would have heard that there was a new man in charge at the Satos’.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a new man at the top. A new face. I forgot his name.” </p><p> </p><p>The other man looked genuinely surprised. In a world where everyone works from bottom up, new faces seizing power was rare. He was a low level employee, so it really didn’t concern him but safe to say he was impressed, “What’s the guy’s deal?” </p><p> </p><p>“Dunno. Dunno where he’s from. Dunno what his background is. Heard he’s young. Blonde…I think he’s white. He took out the youngest Sato son.” </p><p> </p><p>“He killed him?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, he demoted him from chairman to director, idiot.” </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>Before they could continue to shoot shit on the job, a loud honk interrupted them. The two men crushed their cigarettes in a hurry and hustled over to check out the disturbance. </p><p> </p><p>The deal was set to go down at midnight sharp. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis still trusted very few. </p><p> </p><p>When it was time for the trade to happen, he had only a select crew of handpicked people accompany him to the site. He checked his watch and the time was getting close, but Jesse decided to wait it out. He didn’t want to appear overzealous because he knew they wouldn’t take well to a new face, and a young foreigner at that. </p><p> </p><p>When they finally left at precisely quarter till, Jesse stood up, straightened his jacket and the entourage  followed suit, not one word being said. The air was thick, there was a strange tension and every one of his men felt chilled by how cold their new boss was. He never flashed his power, it wasn’t arrogance; it was pure confidence. </p><p> </p><p>They were all used to the ways of the former man in charge who flexed his authority at every opportunity, always making sure he had the biggest cock in the room. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse was quiet. He hardly said anything at all, yet they all knew to obey him. His very presence was authoritative enough, his gaze underneath the dirty blonde locks both willful and determined to conquer by all means necessary. It was laced with a bone-chilling ruthlessness that was hard to forget. </p><p> </p><p>His body language seemed to emit a dangerous aura like it was in everyone’s best interest to stay on his good side. Like he would burn you to pieces otherwise and that Jesse would see to it himself. Not a threat, but a promise. </p><p> </p><p>His right-hand man opened the car door for his boss and Jesse got in. Then the same man closed the door and headed to the second vehicle with the remainder of the people following him.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse briefly closed his eyes expecting their departure, but opened them again when his driver didn’t budge.</p><p> </p><p>“Kageyama, do we have a problem?” Jesse finally uttered, without so much as a glance at the driver.</p><p> </p><p>“S-sir, will it be just you?” Kageyama stuttered.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse briefly felt puzzled by the out-of-character question, but ultimately patiently nodded. His assistant didn’t dare say another word and began driving. From time to time he’d look into the rear mirror to steal glances at his boss, and all he’d see was Jesse resting his head against the seatback, eyes shut. Kageyama learned this was Jesse’s habit before these events, during the short period he served as his executive assistant. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama hoped that this was just another ordinary night for Jesse, to calm his own nerves yet little did he know Jesse has had a relentless pulsing in his right eyelid for hours. Jesse hated that he believed in superstition, given that he was only here because of his unpredictable behavior. </p><p> </p><p>But he had a bad feeling, deep down in his guts. </p><p> </p><p>He was well-aware that he walked into power with a blind confidence, but frankly Jesse didn’t care. He toyed with the gold ring on his index finger and despite his poker face, he tried to calm the weird sinking feeling he felt. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse knew maybe he could have spent the last decade preparing for an elaborate revenge and he could take down the people he despised in the worst misery. But he didn’t. Some nights he’d stay up wondering why he didn’t plan it, but then he would realize that defeated the whole point. Jesse didn’t want to play by rules; afterall  he lived full-heartedly believing death was always looming around the corner. If he didn’t die, he would win. </p><p> </p><p>When he opened his eyes, Jesse caught Kageyama looking at him in the rear mirror, before quickly darting his eyes away. Jesse was alert, but he didn’t think much of it. Before he could say anything, they had arrived at the location. The driver lowered the car window and exchanged a passage code before the security lifted the gate and they drove in. </p><p> </p><p>Not to their surprise, the other party had already been waiting there. As he got out of the car, his own people arrived in a separate van. </p><p> </p><p>“So you’re the new man in charge?” A voice appeared from the other side, his silhouette becoming more clear as he walked out from behind the blinding headlights of their vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>“Kai.” He tried to hide the surprise in his voice. Jesse was taken off guard as it was not who he expected to see, “What do you want?” </p><p> </p><p>“To form an alliance with you, of course.” The tone of the other man was sarcastic, almost mocking Jesse for even asking the question, “Aren’t you here to sell me that last shipment?” That last shipment was precious cargo. And insinuating Jesse would sell it to their competitor finally tipped him off on what was happening. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse tilted his head slightly, and in his peripheral vision he saw all the people behind him were unfamiliar faces. They weren’t his people at all, and it was starting to add up. The corner of his mouth curved upwards. </p><p> </p><p>“Not a good look on you, I have to say.” Jesse smirked, knowing exactly what was happening now. </p><p> </p><p>He’d been made.</p><p> </p><p>It was like Jesse predicted the way things were going to unfold and as though on cue his youngest uncle, his newest enemy, enters and suddenly all weapons are drawn on Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>“You look desperate.” Jesse doesn’t seem fazed at this turn of events. </p><p> </p><p>“And you look like a dead man.” </p><p> </p><p>The youngest Sato son had always had a reputation for being short-tempered, so it made sense why he was the first to be pushed to this point but truth be told Jesse was not expecting a set-up this quickly after he rose to power. </p><p> </p><p>“It looks bad for you.” Sato Kazuma couldn’t resist an evil smile as he held up what was supposed to be evidence that Jesse was crossing the family. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had been a pain in his side since the day he showed up and aggressively ripped the power out of his hands. Sato Kazuma thought it was finally his day to shine when his old man passed. When he was focusing all his energy on taking down his older brother, Jesse Lewis appeared out of nowhere and seized power in the chaos.</p><p> </p><p>The bastard son of his useless older sister. </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, he was eager to make his nephew disappear. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ve always been the dumb one. Living up your name.” Jesse chuckled, seemingly amused by what should have been a perilous situation. He should’ve known his hot-tempered uncle who only knows violence in his pea-sized brain would try to eliminate him by literally killing him. </p><p> </p><p>“You should go back to being a bastard child.” Kazuma snickered. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse admits he slipped up. But he was never one to cry over spilled milk. Rather his mind was on finding the mole in his inner circle that crossed him. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama. Jesse Lewis needed to see to his death. </p><p> </p><p>“Boys. House rules.” Kazuma exclaimed, filled with a passion and excitement as he fixed his cuff sleeve and retired into his car, “Traitors are executed. Take out the trash.”</p><p> </p><p>Kai followed, and the real traitor left with the enemy. God knows what they were up to next. Jesse scoffed at the pair; it truly takes a snake to know a snake. </p><p> </p><p>Dozens of low level henchmen began to swarm Jesse who fended himself with a broken fragment of plywood until that gave out. He then tried to flee by running towards the metal containers. Jesse was thankful that at the least the standard issue weapon was just a knife or a bat, alas he was very outnumbered, so he took a brutal beating before he could clear himself of the people who were after him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse immediately looked for the car he came in, ready to go after the son of bitch who sold him. The salt filled wind blowing against his newly torn open flesh stung, but after circling the pier a few times he finally found the vehicle. Jesse knew luck would be on his side after all because the man he was looking for was still in the car. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse pushed his bloody blonde locks back and approached the driver side of the car. Before Kageyama could react and flee the vehicle, Jesse threw the car door open and dragged the man out by the collar. He tossed him onto the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood before brutally kicking his former employee in the guts numerous times. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama didn’t fight back; deep down his loyalty was still with Jesse. Such was life on the dark side. He had been threatened by Kazuma to sell out his boss, but Jesse wasn’t having any of it. </p><p> </p><p>“I-I can expla..in.” The man on the ground gasped for air, “I can explain.” </p><p> </p><p>“No need.” At first it was half a hunch, but now Jesse was certain. </p><p> </p><p>His former boss pushed the bottom of his shoe against Kageyama’s cheek, literally stepping down on his face until he ran out of energy to fight back. This beating wasn’t for show and it certainly wasn’t simply to teach him a lesson then let him go. Jesse’s eyes grew cold; the anger had entirely subsided and he bent over, studying Kageyama’s now swollen yet terrified face for a split second before he lifted the pant leg of the foot resting on the man’s face. He drew a gun on him point blank and ended his misery. </p><p> </p><p>He tucked away his firearm, his neat dress shirt now stained with patches of crimson and his chiseled face now frayed with bruises. Jesse planned to escape on water, hijacking one of the yachts parked in the shallow parts of the bay. He dashed towards the main road but before he could react, a blinding headlight came towards him, slowing down before it hit him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh precious nephew. You should’ve chosen sides better.” Kazuma sadistically remarked from behind the wheel before he called in a few people to drag Jesse into custody. He should’ve killed Jesse, but he decided to have fun. It was family bonding time. He laughed maniacally.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Jesse came to, he felt like his head would split open and his ears rang endlessly, adding to the headache. He shook his head in an attempt to focus his vision, and when it finally came into focus, he realized he was tied onto a chair in an abandoned factory. His best guess was he was still near the shipyard. When he heard his uncle’s voice, Jesse confirmed that hypothesis as his uncle lacked brain cells for anything spectacular. </p><p> </p><p>“You just couldn’t let me die, huh” Jesse had the first words, despite the pain that throbbed against every inch of his body.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not.” Kazuma slowly walked into the building, like he was some kind of super villain and that was the part that made Jesse want to hurl the most. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret it.” </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> wish </em> you would stop acting so tough! You’re cornered! ” He continued to raise his voice, “Can’t you see you have no way out?!” He was filled to the brim with a manic laugh. Once he was within Jesse’s proximity, he kicked the chair and it toppled over, with Jesse still tied to it. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse hacked up a bloody cough before laughing.</p><p> </p><p>This triggered Kazuma, who behaved like an elementary bully who hadn’t gotten his way. He harshly kicked his nephew, sending him abruptly sliding a few feet away. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse laid on the floor limply, but then he looked up at his captor and revealed a smile, blood between his teeth, “Kill me, will you?” He taunted. </p><p> </p><p>This infuriated him more and took the fun out of the beating, so Kazuma turned and punched the subordinate who had been standing beside him out of frustration that his new toy was misbehaving. </p><p> </p><p>“Kill him. I’m done.” </p><p> </p><p>He left in a hurry after those words, “So boring.” He muttered as he pulled out his phone to dial up the brothel he frequented asking them to send over girls to his place. </p><p> </p><p>Once their boss left, the subordinates got to work. The same pair who had been sent to stake out at the site were left to kill the man who was supposedly the new top boss. Jesse truly was ready to pass out from the damage he sustained, but he still was only pretending to lay limply while the two men came over to fetch him. One untied him and they began to drag him outside, planning to execute him then toss into the Tokyo bay. </p><p> </p><p>But they didn’t unarm him thoroughly after hitting him with a car. Jesse “woke up” and took the two by surprise. He pulled an army swiss knife on them, stabbing one in the eye and while he shrieked, the other tried to run and Jesse planted the knife in his thigh, causing him to topple over clutching his leg. He quickly searched the man for car keys before stumbling outside, everything still spinning from the collision. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse found the car and sped away as soon as he could muster the energy to do so. He simply drove until he found familiar roads and then he pulled over at an inning to clear his head. </p><p> </p><p>He groaned as he pulled his tie off, wincing at the fresh wounds and the blood that had now dried on his face and hands. By now word must have spread and the whole organization must have labeled him as a traitor. Jesse was certain, however, that his pea-brained uncle didn’t have much on him. But Kazuma was like a child, too easy to anger, so Jesse needed somewhere safe to lay low until he could go back to fix the problem. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had allies, but they were also people he needed to protect from Kazuma. He didn’t know why, but deep down there was one place that came to mind and he was drawn there like a magnet. A place he should least trust yet Jesse had been there more times than he cared to admit in the last few weeks.</p><p> </p><p>He knew the way by heart. </p><p> </p><p>He had no time to spare. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After driving through several small roads leading up to the mansion, Jesse parked his car by a roadside ditch and limped his way to the house. The car would be tracked at some point, so he best dump it anyway. Once he got close enough, he stopped to look at the mansion. It was 3am but the lights were still on. Jesse would know, he watched the house one too many nights. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse even knew that the housekeeper slept in a separate house with the rest of the family that took care of the house. He knew there could only be one person who came to the door. </p><p> </p><p>When the security headed towards the south side of the mansion, Jesse climbed the shorter walls on the north end and walked right up the marble doorsteps. He didn’t think this was how they’d meet again, but there was a part of him that wanted to trust so badly. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse firmly knocked a few times, before collapsing onto the steps. Fatigue was beginning to get the best of him, and he only regained consciousness from a haze when he heard the door open after an hour. </p><p> </p><p>In the dead of the night, Matsumura Hokumi stood barefoot in her nightgown, her dark brown curls blowing in the night breeze, and a bloody man collapsed at her doorsteps. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis. </p><p> </p><p>Before he could open his mouth, Hokumi beat him to it, “Please go die on a different set of doorsteps.” Hokumi coldly said, gathering her thin robe closer against her body and tried to close the door, but Jesse shot up and stopped her. </p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you the least bit curious–” </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi hesitated. She didn’t know why. She barely knew this man. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know where else to go.” And for someone who always had his guard up, those were honest words from Jesse. And Hokumi knew. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re a wanted man. I could kill you right now.” Turns out the word had long spread that there was a huge bounty out on Jesse right now. Hokumi may not be the most powerful of the Matsumuras, but she still heard things. </p><p> </p><p>“I would collect a hefty bounty and then I’d get on good terms with your uncle.” She proposed, seeming absolute, that she would do just that despite being a petite woman standing in her nightgown in front of a man who towered over her. Somehow it was absolutely convincing, but Jesse didn’t believe it for a second. </p><p> </p><p>She looked up at him, right in the eyes,  “What makes you think I won’t do just that?”</p><p> </p><p>“You won’t.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you and I aren’t much different.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse could feel her grip on the door loosen and without another word, she turned around and walked away, leaving the door wide open. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi was not one to perform acts of kindness out of the tenderness of her heart, yet something about Jesse haunted her. The way wisps of his presence seemed to weave its way into her guarded heart. She wanted to submit. </p><p><br/>

The cab driver looked at him from the rear mirror and realized his passenger had no luggage, yet clad from head to toe in pitch black–a three-piece suit, tie, dress shoes–which only made his blonde hair stand out. Everything about Jesse struck him as odd, but he didn’t want to mess with the wrong person. He had no way of knowing who Jesse was, but his years of driving told him Jesse was someone dangerous. </p><p> </p><p>With deliberately slowed Japanese, the driver simply asked Jesse where he was headed. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at the man through the mirror and replied fluently, then simply looked out the window for the remainder of the trip. He had very little to reminisce about Tokyo, but this country will always remind him of his late mother.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse thanked the driver when he arrived. After leaving a few notes of ten thousand yen he promptly exited the car. Before the driver could give change, he noticed all the men in black suits stationed at this temple and quickly pulled away. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse straightened his suit and made his way onto the funeral grounds. He looked out of place because of his foreign appearance and while everyone gave side glances, he walked with full authority. He paid no attention to the pouring rain, walking up the stairs that led into the main hall. Rain had soaked his entire person, but Jesse simply pushed his drenched hair back and proceeded directly to the front of the room at the ceremony. The aroma of burning incense filled the room and a row of priests lined the walls chanting a low sutra. It was the funeral for the late CEO and Chairman of the Sato Corporation and anyone who saw Jesse’s expression would say he was meant to be there. He had a firm look, strangely no signs of condolence, like he was simply there to fact check. </p><p> </p><p>The Sato siblings were in front row attendance at their father’s funeral. Kaito, the eldest son, was the first to notice Jesse. But Jesse didn’t look at anyone, walking right up to the large black and white portrait that hung in the center, his hands now in his pocket to display an intentional lack of respect. </p><p> </p><p>Kazuma, the youngest of the Sato siblings, broke the strange silence, “Who are you? Who let you in?” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse paid no attention to him. </p><p> </p><p>Kazuma got agitated by Jesse’s disregard, but this time Kaito steps in, “Excuse me, this is a private ceremony.” </p><p> </p><p>A businessman in his late forties stood up, buttoned his suit jacket as though second nature for a gentleman. He walked up to Jesse and was obviously a whole head shorter than Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse finally looked over and silently studied him, albeit for a few brief moments it made Kaito rather uncomfortable. It was like this man knew him, yet he didn’t know who this man was. His jarring attitude </p><p>and tall stature only made it even more intimidating. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, I have every right to be here.” Jesse finally replied while looking back at the portrait.</p><p> </p><p>“Right, Grandpa?” The man’s tone was mocking, with obvious lack of care for his late grandfather. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re…” Kaito’s eyes widen, immediately piecing things together. </p><p> </p><p>“Surprised?” Jesse snickered, “Uncle Kaito.” He said loud enough for the entire room to hear. </p><p> </p><p>At this point, a woman in her early fifties stood up. The last of the Sato siblings was the eldest daughter, Kazumi. Perhaps it was the way she looked more polished and refined than most women her age, her partially gray hair neatly combed into a low-do, but she approached Jesse’s appearance rather calmly. </p><p> </p><p>“Enough.” Kazumi sternly said, “Are you going to pay your respects to your grandfather?” </p><p> </p><p>She hoped Jesse would not cause a ruckus in the funeral hall. But Jesse didn’t care. He came to make a scene. </p><p> </p><p>“Aunt Kazumi.” Jesse studied her as well, looking her in the eye, “Never thought you’d see me right?” </p><p> </p><p>She said nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s time you all remember what you did.” </p><p> </p><p>Before Jesse could say anything else, this time Kazumi interrupted, “Masaya.” </p><p> </p><p>She called Jesse by his childhood name, and Jesse wasn’t sure if it was a way to pretend to be intimate with him or she simply did not know he was no longer Masaya. </p><p> </p><p>“Your grandfather would be happy to see you.” Kazumi said, but it boiled his blood at how good she was at being fake. </p><p> </p><p>“No.” Jesse shook his head, denying how hard Kazumi tried to make the old man seem like a good person now that he was six feet under, “He’s lucky he’s dead.” </p><p> </p><p>And then in a quieter voice, Jesse spoke directly to his aunt, “I’m free now.” His smile was chilling. </p><p> </p><p>Free from his imprisonment, Jesse looked straight at the people who killed his parents. Even without a single word from him, he told them that he was waging war. </p><p> </p><p>With that, Jesse walked out, before his aunt stopped him. </p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you going to pay your respects?” The entire room was frozen silent, waiting for his response.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think so.” Jesse coldly said without even turning around for one moment. </p><p> </p><p>He arrived at the door, but stopped again. </p><p> </p><p>“And it’s Jesse now.” </p><p> </p><p>Everyone looked at him, puzzled. </p><p> </p><p>“Masaya is dead. I’m Jesse Lewis. Remember that name.” </p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>After leaving the funeral hall, Jesse found a nondescript tinted dark SUV parked outside waiting for him. The car took him to the other side of town, weaving past the city and he tried to clear his mind as the thrill of looking his enemies in the eye wore off. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had been zoning out, standing by in the empty lobby of the mansion alone when a warm voice entered the room.</p><p> </p><p>“My goodness, you are so much taller than I remember, sweetheart.” </p><p> </p><p>A woman slowly arrived at Jesse’s heel, wheeled over by a servant. Her smile was bright and contagious, and she gingerly held Jesse’s hand with her own hands creased with wrinkles. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse smiled back at his grandaunt, his first genuine smile since his return. He knelt down to the woman’s level, his voice naturally growing gentle, “Is this how you remember me?” </p><p> </p><p>Once he lowered himself, she softly patted his head, with a look that seemed to say so much even though no words came out. </p><p> </p><p>“Welcome home.” She finally said after a long pause. Jesse got up and gestured at the servant to dismiss him as Jesse pushed her wheelchair into the dining room. He parked his grandaunt at one end of the table and before he could go anywhere, she insisted he sit beside her. He was happy to accompany her, and she went on about how Jesse used to look just like his mother, but seeing him today he was now a splitting image of his father–the same blonde hair, the same tall nose. </p><p> </p><p>Her voice then softened, when he told him that he had his mother’s gentle eyes. She always told Jesse that his mother didn’t have a single bad bone in her body and Jesse felt his heart ache, knowing he couldn’t remember how warm her touch was.</p><p> </p><p>When Jesse wanted to ask her how she had been, his grandaunt, Youko had gotten down to business. </p><p> </p><p>“You went to see Sousuke’s kids already?” Youko was referring to her niece and nephews. </p><p> </p><p>“I did.” </p><p> </p><p>“They must have been thrilled to see you.” Youko chuckled, the way old people do when told a particularly interesting anecdote. </p><p> </p><p>“They won’t know what hit them.” Jesse reassured Youko he was ready. </p><p> </p><p>“You have my full support.” Her tone was firm and goes on to gesture to her assistant to bring over a briefcase that had everything Jesse needed to settle in: car keys, house keys, legal documents, and the likes. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course, sweetheart.” Youko may have retired years ago, but her influence was still as powerful as ever. </p><p> </p><p>Having long severed ties with her brother, Youko made it a point to skip the funeral. She couldn’t see how a man who drove his own child to death then tormented his grandson was worth her time. She was resentful as well; because she knew exactly how brother’s behavior had been learned from their father. </p><p> </p><p>Youko would always remember the day she gave her own son up for adoption to save him from her father. So she looked at Jesse to fulfill her selfish desire to repent. She knew his mother would’ve wanted her to watch over her only son. </p><p> </p><p>“Kana was the only kind one.” Youko would always say, “But she was also stubborn. So headstrong and so unyielding.” </p><p> </p><p>During Jesse’s time abroad, secret letters from Youko were the only way Jesse maintained connection. It was his lifeline, hearing about the wonderful person his mother was and it fueled his desire to avenge her. Youko knew that perhaps this was a burden Jesse would have to carry, but nonetheless she knew if Jesse was Kana’s son he would be strong just like her. </p><p> </p><p>Youko knew Jesse would come to seek revenge, so one day she simply offered her full support, that she would help him in the shadows. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse agreed. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The funeral lasted all of seven whole days. While all the stakeholders were still in town, Sato Corp held a board meeting. Everyone knew that this was a volatile time, power was up for grabs, and they all wanted a bigger slice of the pie. </p><p> </p><p>This board meeting was scheduled to be a daylong affair. Normally they met at headquarters, but with this session being different, the corporate team found a neutral but secluded location. Everyone was allowed a handful of escorts, and naturally they all hand picked their best and brightest. </p><p> </p><p>At the meeting, Kaito gave opening remarks as the acting chairman and requested the meeting to begin. To his surprise, the head legal counsel maintained that all parties had not been seated yet. Legal had been invited as a neutral party to facilitate the meeting, so no parties could object to this delay.</p><p> </p><p>There was a tension in the room, everyone murmuring amongst themselves, speculating who the mysterious missing parties were. Finally, Kaito got up again and tried to begin the meeting. He was once again blocked by the legal team, who were the executors of the late chairman and CEO’s will. </p><p> </p><p>But this time Kaito didn’t plan to adhere to the objection. </p><p> </p><p>“Respectfully, which parties are we missing?” Kaito asked, careful to be politically correct. His siblings were already in attendance and appeared equally discontent at the delay. </p><p> </p><p>“Just one member.” The counsel replied. </p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we proceed without them?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sir.” He tried to keep his voice down, “Sir, he is your biggest shareholder.” </p><p> </p><p>Before Kaito could take in the full weight of that statement, a man pushed through the heavy dark oak double doors. They recognized him immediately. He was the young blonde haired man from the funeral who said his name was Jesse Lewis. </p><p> </p><p>Surely people expected shifts in the power dynamic, players coming and going, but they hadn’t anticipated the absolute shuffle Jesse had planned. </p><p> </p><p>People did not expect an illegitimate forgotten family member to find a seat at the board meeting. </p><p> </p><p>At first they had no idea who he was, until they remembered that he was Kana’s son. He was the child the old man tucked away abroad and forbade from returning to Japan. Till his death no one knew what his plan with Jesse was. Likewise, no one knew much about Jesse. His motive, his vulnerabilities, nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry I’m late.” Jesse’s entrance drew everyone’s attention. But Jesse wasn’t the least bit sorry; he liked seeing the dumbstruck expression on everyone’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s you again.” Kazuma, his youngest uncle piped up this time, “Stupid bastard brat.” He muttered under his breath, visibly annoyed at Jesse’s presence. </p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, Jesse usurped the seat at the head of the table, “Now shall we begin?” </p><p> </p><p>Still struck by the statement earlier, his uncle took a seat. It was beginning to sink in with the remaining of the shareholders that Jesse Lewis, a nobody before today, had manifested from thin air and became the single most influential power in this colossal empire. Jesse Lewis could rewrite the fate of this family singlehandedly. </p><p> </p><p>It was safe to say everyone was taken off-guard. All the alliances had been formed for naught and Jesse thrived. He most certainly was not modest about the ordeal. They needed to feel every ounce of humiliation he had planned for them.</p><p> </p><p>“So.” Jesse cleared his throat, leaning on the large conference room table, “Which ones of you were involved in…” He flipped through the file that had been set in front of his seat prior to his arrival.</p><p> </p><p>“The Shanghai Deal.” Jesse finished, taking a cursory glance around the room before continuing.</p><p> </p><p>No one responded and Jesse threw the folder at the table, slapping onto the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it was a fucking embarrassment. I expect better.” </p><p> </p><p>One of the stakeholders retorted, “What do you expect we do with the team we sent?” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse looked at him like he had two heads, “They’re your fucking men. Discipline them.” </p><p> </p><p>And it was at this moment the acting chairman of Sato Corp had realized Jesse hijacked his meeting and attempted to resume control. </p><p> </p><p>“Masaya–”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Jesse. I’m not correcting you again.” Jesse’s gaze shot daggers through his uncle, not an ounce of sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesse…” Kaito cowered, before weakly asking, “Can we please stick to the agenda?” </p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in the back, Kazuma rolled his eyes. He never understood how his spineless older brother came into power. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse only looked at Kaito as though he heard a funny joke, “Uncle Kaito, let me make one thing clear.” </p><p> </p><p>This time he spoke to the entire room, “I don’t know nor <em> care </em> how things were before, but this is not a democracy. We don’t vote here.”</p><p> </p><p>His words sounded arrogant, but his tone was harsh as though he meant every last syllable.</p><p> </p><p>“I run this place now. What I say goes.” Jesse’s words were simple, but it had a threatening undertone that was difficult to ignore. Jesse hadn’t intended to sound threatening, but he was not about to tolerate any non-sense. Not when he waited decades for this. </p><p> </p><p>“Any question?” He asked the silent room out of courtesy.</p><p> </p><p>Out of character, Kaito took a last stand, “You can’t do this!” </p><p> </p><p>The statement was comical, and Jesse ridiculed it as such, “You’re right. Let’s vote.”</p><p> </p><p>“All in favor of expelling Sato Kaito as the chairman.” </p><p> </p><p>The room fell into a thick silence, and when voting was finished, the votes were nearly tied until Jesse suddenly voted in favor, toppling the votes to one side. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>“Looks like we have an opening for a new chairman.” Jesse looked over at Kaito, who had just been demoted. His face had gone pale, nearly collapsing into his seat. </p><p> </p><p>Attempting to assume order back into this meeting, this time his Aunt Kazumi stood up. She seemed less antagonistic than Kaito had appeared and Jesse pretended to be fooled by this false kindness. She urged everyone to think for the better of this company they all swore to protect. Jesse clapped, and the room followed. Everyone feared him, both because he held so much power but also because he wasn’t afraid to abuse it. </p><p> </p><p>All except Kazuma who walked out of the meeting, but not without kicking his seat and throwing a fit. He was not one to stand up for his brother, but he knew his lunatic nephew would be looking to stir things up. He knew he was in line to be on the receiving end anyways. There was no need to stick around for the rest of this clown show. Kazuma knew he had to think of a way to rid of Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>By the end of the meeting, Jesse had done nothing but ruffle feathers and shatter any status quo that existed prior to the day. </p><p> </p><p>“That will be all for today.” The facilitator announced, but before anyone could retire from attendance, Jesse interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Actually there’s one more thing.” Jesse stood up.</p><p> </p><p>“Sato Corporation will be renamed Lewis Corporation, effective immediately.” Jesse announced and without another word, he walked out of the room. No escorts, no entourage, and he effectively made every single person in that room look like a fool.</p><p> </p><p>This was the biggest “fuck you” to his dead grandfather, but also his official declaration of war. </p><p> </p><p>In the parking garage, a black sedan pulls up to Jesse. He stops when the window lowers and it was his aunt, Kazumi. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesse, let’s talk.” She simply said. He didn’t know if this was some kind of scare tactic, but for her amicable behavior, Jesse was challenged. He always knew she was the smartest of the trio, but she hadn’t shown a shred of vulnerability in the face of everything he has done so far.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Jesse got into the back seat with his aunt. The driver put the car into park, before promptly leaving the car to give them privacy.</p><p> </p><p>“First of all, I’m sorry you feel how you do. It’s obvious you feel a lot of resentment.” Kazumi was not a vulgar person; on the contrary she always spoke like an adult scolding a child and Jesse wasn’t sure if that was more infuriating. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be sorry. Your sorry is worth about as much as the dirt on the bottom of my shoe.” Jesse knew she hadn’t stopped him to apologize.</p><p> </p><p>She lightly chuckled, “I’ll get to the point.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse listened.</p><p> </p><p>“I know Kaito. Today’s decision will paralyze him, sending him scurrying into the shadows with his tail between his legs.” Kazumi analyzed, but Jesse didn’t get it. Why was she stating the obvious?</p><p> </p><p>“But Kazuma? He's a useless overgrown child, but he’s impulsive, violent, and easy to anger.” </p><p> </p><p>Then she looked over to Jesse, “Right now the thing you ripped from his brother. He’d been oppressed by Kaito his whole life. He <em> will </em>go after your shining new toy.” Kazumi stated with certainty. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s welcome to.” Jesse planned on it.</p><p> </p><p>“Good to know.” </p><p> </p><p>Then it clicked with Jesse, “What about you?” </p><p> </p><p>“What would you like me to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stay out of it.” </p><p> </p><p>Kazumi was sly, subtly taking control of the situation, “And what do I have to benefit?” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse couldn’t afford any sort of unity amongst the siblings, so he offered up the biggest prize to ensure he could savor every one of his prey. </p><p> </p><p>“Now you’re just taking me for an idiot.” Jesse sneered, “If you wanted to be the chairwoman, you should just fucking say so.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse shot a glare in Kazumi’s direction before he got out of the car, having come to a verbal agreement with her. An enemy’s enemy was his friend. He watched as her car slowly drove away and he spat on the ground, as though disgusted by this temporary alliance. </p><p> </p><p>She would get her turn eventually. </p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>Word of Jesse Lewis traveled fast. Rumors of a new power player always alarmed people, and naturally they wanted to feel out any weaknesses they could exploit. Not to mention, the overall sentiment had been unsettling with the civil disruptions in power in a family as large as the Satos. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis had been so brazen to rename the company entirely after himself after all. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse received an invitation to make an appearance as the new face of the Lewis Corp the following week. In the meantime, Jesse had handpicked a team from the recommendations his grand aunt sent over. His assistant, Kageyama’s first task had been to pick out a suit for Jesse’s attendance at the gala. </p><p> </p><p>After his morning shower, the suit had been pressed and laid on his bed. It was a three piece in a silky black luxury vicuna and Jesse was pleased with the choice. With a towel wrapped around his waist, he picked out a cool burgundy dress shirt to go with the suit. Frankly, he’d never been fond of neckties and he didn’t give two fucks about a dress code, so Jesse opted for gold necklaces instead. </p><p> </p><p>He left his house early that morning, having affairs to personally attend to prior to the gala. While everyone assumed his priority was networking, Jesse Lewis only had one particular goal in mind. He had a lady he fancied to impress, so he needed to handpick out a gift and send flowers. After all, he wanted to appear sincere, no matter how adulterated his motives truly were. </p><p> </p><p>As expected, Jesse was the main spectacle at the event. People simply didn’t know what to make of him. To their surprise, he wasn’t the ruthless man rumors made him out to be. Rather, Jesse played nice; after all he had no qualms with these people. They were inconsequential. His attention was focused on sifting the crowd for one person.</p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi. The sole daughter of the powerful Matsumura family. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had read the file on her years ago, when he was studying every power in play in Tokyo. It was absurd then, and it was still absurd now but he could feel a connection to her. And Jesse needed to verify this himself. Until then, he hadn’t been able to forget her. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi could be the perfect ally for him. If he could marry her, she could be that weak link in a powerful family he sought to manipulate. </p><p> </p><p>When he finally made it to the other end of the hall, Jesse found her. Hokumi stood in the back, quiet and unnoticed, with her long brown locks tossed in a loose updo. She donned a minimalistic white one-piece with strappy heels that made her figure appear even more elegant. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse slowly approached her, hoping that she was everything he imagined. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi had picked up a flute of champagne on her way in and hoped to nurse the drink until auctions began. She found herself on the quieter side of the room, patiently waiting until the main event. Hokumi set down her clutch along with her drink on the cocktail table, with no intentions to socialize. After all, she rarely found herself alone at these events. Women in the Matsumura family were only ever paraded around like accessories to the important men they came with. Hokumi was used to it and gave up resisting this twisted definition of being a “proper lady”. She simply planned to go through the motions of the event. </p><p> </p><p>“Matsumura-san?” An unfamiliar voice broke Hokumi out of her zone. She looked towards the voice and it belonged to an equally unfamiliar face. It was surprising because she should know everyone in attendance. It was part of her upbringing. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi studied the man, but her response was silent. He was tall, his dark blonde hair neatly combed back revealing a perfectly structured face, one that she knows she would not forget, even if she’d seen it once. His suit was of the highest class; she had been trained to recognize these kinds of things.</p><p> </p><p>The man smiled, “I take it the earrings were not to your likings?” </p><p> </p><p>His eyes diverted to her ears sporting a different pair of earrings than the diamond ones he had picked out earlier that day as a gift to her. How could Hokumi forget such bold gesture? </p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Lewis.” Hokumi promptly apologized for not recognizing him. Of course it was the infamous Jesse Lewis.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet you.” Jesse was proud at his cheeky line working on her </p><p> </p><p>“Cheers?” He raised his glass and she returned the gesture to be courteous. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>“To what pleasure do I owe your wonderful gift?” Hokumi asked. She had cut straight to the chase, but it wasn’t offensive. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse only half-expected this type of response. But he was prepared nonetheless.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to get on your good side. Your family.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse stressed, “<em> You </em> are a worthy opponent in this business. I would hate to be opposite you.” </p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Hokumi didn’t expect this answer to her question. She had always gotten suitors who would send gifts, then praise her along the lines of her beauty, her grace. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis was the first one to ever see past that. And she knew she would remember that forever. </p><p> </p><p>But she deflected in her response, “I would never. ” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse knew it was professionalism, but before he could respond, she added, “And if you were, you wouldn’t know.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi had one toxic trait. When her walls were torn down, she always needed to do anything to regain control of the situation. And this was her sorry attempt at that. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse gazed into her eyes without another word. She didn’t know what revealed itself in her own eyes, but if this were a competition, she would’ve lost. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi felt exposed, by merely one look Jesse Lewis gave her. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you accompany me to the auction?” Jesse was never one to back down. </p><p> </p><p>“I have to decline.” Her refusal was simple and to the point. She wasted no extra breath to sugarcoat, which Jesse respected, given the way women are treated in her family. She was the unfavored child by far, yet she did not bend to the will of men in her life. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why he felt a shadow of him in her. </p><p> </p><p>After taking another sip of her champagne, Hokumi immediately tries to excuse herself, not because she didn’t want to talk to him, but because she couldn’t reciprocate whatever Jesse was intending. This was just another event she had been forced to show her face at when it wasn’t good enough for her brother. When he insisted on keeping her company, Jesse watched as Hokumi’s demeanor changed from the courteous upper class socialite to one that was much colder. Hokumi left him only yearning for more. </p><p> </p><p>After excusing herself, she had been shown to her seat in the auction hall. Hokumi thought back to earlier that day. She thought about how the diamond earrings that had been delivered to her residence were actually perfectly to her liking, but she had been wary to wear them because they came with nothing but the sender’s name: Jesse Lewis. Then she remembered the bouquet the earrings came with. Amongst the baby breath and lavender were brilliant white daisies, and Hokumi remembered thinking it was unlike any other bouquet she had ever received. She had an urge to ask why. </p><p> </p><p>Why did he send daisies? </p><p> </p><p>As thoughts of Jesse’s mysterious actions haunted Hokumi, the room had begun to slowly fill with people and a pair sat in the seats beside Hokumi. It came to her attention that Jesse had been the star of the night. Everyone simply wanted to see the man who overran the Sato siblings. Hokumi had to admit she was impressed. And inadvertently, she began to eavesdrop, learning more than she bargained for. It wasn’t surprising for her to learn that Jesse took his father’s last name or that Jesse had just returned from abroad, and that it appeared he was on some kind of revenge manifesto. But Hokumi remembered her heart sinking a teeny bit, learning that Jesse was the son of the late Sato Kana, who mysteriously died twenty years ago. They were only children then. Even she remembered the impact of that news. She would always remember the day she lost her mother vividly like yesterday and she knew how hard that must have been for him. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi stopped eavesdropping, but her mind continued to wonder what it was Jesse wanted from her. She admitted, his ridiculous good looks helped. But it was the way he looked at her. He saw her. </p><p> </p><p>She felt a wild attraction, like a moth to a flame. Like his one look pierced through her flesh, her bones, right into her soul. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse proceeded to the other room as the event began. His mind had not left Hokumi. In a crowded room, he immediately found her on the other side of the room. He hadn’t expected her to fall in line perfectly with his plans, but frankly Jesse had expected to make more headway. Her walls were high, and Jesse could only think about what it must be like to be let inside. </p><p> </p><p>He felt an absurd attraction, drawn like magnets. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse couldn’t rest until he could figure out what it was about Hokumi that drew him in. He could remember almost physically feeling her slip from his grasp in the short exchange they had. He felt as though in the final moment she had shown her claws and threatened him to not come closer. And Jesse did exactly that. </p><p> </p><p>Between the time he spent laying down traps to pitch his uncles against each other and ruthlessly coming into more power, Jesse fought an urge to learn more about Hokumi. Jesse found the easiest way to learn more; he found himself stalking her every move. He found himself driving to her house, watching her day and night when he could and truly it was unlike anything he’d felt. </p><p> </p><p>Before meeting Matsumura Hokumi, Jesse truly believed she was someone he’d use and dispose. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse didn’t realize Hokumi would become the reason, the beginning of him spiraling off course.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis stood at her doorsteps, bloody, bruised and with nowhere to go. She tried to shut him down, she tried to tell him what she would do as any logical person would. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi looked up at Jesse, right in the eyes,  “What makes you think I won’t do just that?” </p><p> </p><p>It was a dare, but also she wondered how Jesse had gotten this tight hold on her without her knowing. </p><p> </p><p>“You won’t.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you and I aren’t much different.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse could feel her grip on the door loosen and without another word, she turned around and walked away, leaving the door wide open. Hokumi had every reason to kill Jesse, but the moment she decided to let him in, she already decided she wanted to save him. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi was not one to perform acts of kindness out of the tenderness of her heart, yet something about Jesse haunted her. The way wisps of his presence seemed to weave its way into her guarded heart. </p><p> </p><p>Her footsteps reverberated in the empty halls of the mansion and a second set limped behind her. It was obvious Hokumi was its only resident and it was a reflection of her life. She never had many people by her side: friends, family or otherwise. Jesse studied her body language, the way she clung to herself, not because she was scared of him; it was habitual, like she had always been a deeply insecure person. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse stopped in his tracks as he followed her down the long hallway, breaking the silence between them.</p><p> </p><p>“How can I convince you to trust me?” </p><p> </p><p>For a man who had been so confident they were not much different, Hokumi could only assume that Jesse was asking a different question. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi turned around, Jesse slowly approached her in the long narrow hallway. He was closing the distance and even until the moment he pressed right up against her, Hokumi did not budge an inch. Jesse towered over her, smelling like a faint cologne mixed with blood. He looked down and a lock of golden hair landed between his eyes. Hokumi felt him locked eyes with her, and then his hand gently touched her thigh and slid briefly up her soft nightgown. </p><p> </p><p>“I know you were not kidding.” Jesse pulled a gun from her thigh holster beneath her silk nightgown</p><p> </p><p>“But I prefer you don’t kill me.” His breath was warm on her skin, his eyes both gentle and firm. This Jesse was difficult to resist. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi didn’t want to tell Jesse she had already decided to save him. Instead, she makes him work for it. </p><p> </p><p>“What can you offer me?” Hokumi glances down before looking up at him. This time Jesse takes a step back. </p><p> </p><p>“What is it that you want in life?” Jesse asks a grand question with the most serious tone. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi knew the answer to this question. She wants to be seen, the way Jesse always manages to see her. She wants to feel important. But for now, Hokumi deflects, not ready to open up to the man she let into her house in the middle of the night. </p><p> </p><p>“Peace.” </p><p> </p><p>“Peace?” </p><p> </p><p>“World peace.” Hokumi replied, while continuing into the guest room. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse laughed, knowing that Hokumi was fucking with him. She hadn’t planned to answer his overly philosophical question. It was a long shot anyways. He followed her steps into the guest room and she subtly gestured him over to the bed. </p><p> </p><p>“Answer my question.” Hokumi checked the perimeters and drew the curtains closed.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse couldn’t believe he didn’t have a good answer to her question, except the one that instinctively came to him. </p><p> </p><p>“If you will be on my side.” Instantly he lost the edge in his voice. It was raw and it drew Hokumi in at once. </p><p> </p><p>“Then I vow to protect you with my life.” </p><p> </p><p>“I promise I won’t ever let anyone hurt you.” His voice softens up. </p><p> </p><p>The air froze between the two, and Hokumi had never imagined the impact his promise would have on her. She felt her heart clutch at her soul, even her deepest vulnerabilities felt shielded despite this vow coming from a literal broken man, busted at the seams with blood and bruises. Jesse vowed with so much conviction, and Hokumi knew it could absolutely only come from someone who had risen from the deepest pain. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi didn’t know why his words meant so much to her, moving her to the core despite her knowing that he may never even get to act on it. Maybe she lacked self-awareness, she never knew her innate desire to be protected. She thought she wanted to be his savior. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi discovered a feeling she never knew she had; she wondered if this was how it felt to be treasured. </p><p> </p><p>Seeing Hokumi gone silent, Jesse held out his hand. She sat on the bedside next to Jesse and in the palm of his hand held a large gold ring. She studied it, the intricate art woven, etched into its surface and Jesse put it into her hand. </p><p> </p><p>“This was my coming of age and it’s easily worth my life.” He said, “It’s now in your hands.” </p><p> </p><p>It was an old tradition and it wasn’t uncommon for these organizations to have rigorous deathly coming-of-age for their men, to prove their worth. In Jesse’s case, his trial left him within inches of his life before it ended. This ring showed for it.  </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi toyed with the large ring in her hand and she couldn’t tell him that she had long decided she would join his side even without this collateral. But she pretended to consider before holding out her free hand. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re safe with me.” </p><p> </p><p>The two shook hands on their newly found alliance while sitting on the edge of the bed, side by side as they found themselves. Then Hokumi smiled for the first time since their meeting. Jesse couldn’t believe his eyes; her smile was so beautiful and unforgettable. It was a brief, yet beautiful moment. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi was a woman of action. While drawing the curtains, she noticed suspicious activity that she chalked up as the people who had followed Jesse to her house. She hid away the ring in a safe place and got to work.</p><p> </p><p>“Make yourself at home.” Hokumi muttered while fetching a gun and a magazine from the nightstand. </p><p> </p><p>“I have to take care of some rats.” She said under her breath while loading the gun and then slid it in the holster that Jesse had disarmed earlier. </p><p> </p><p>She had quietly closed the door behind her, leaving him alone in the room while she went to meet those who dared break into her house. Hokumi turned the corner, entering her main living room and she was immediately shot at. Seeing as the man had been in a hurry to get rid of her, she concluded he desperately needed to get to Jesse before the others did. They were all after those three million yens hovering over his head individually. She ducked behind the couch and then intentionally let out a scared scream. When the man heard her, he had taken down his guard and brazenly walked to the other end of the room. He did not realize Hokumi had snuck up behind him and given him two in the stomach, then smothered him with a pillow before giving him one in the head. She frowned as her pillow stuffing flew about. It was ruined but at least she saved her walls from blood splatter. </p><p> </p><p>She left the body on the ground and encountered another one descending her staircase. Hokumi was not above playing the same trick twice as she feigned to be terrified and threw up her hands. Even in the dark of the night, the other hitman could tell she was a beautiful young woman so he didn't shoot. He carefully approached her and once he got close enough, he tried to disarm her, but Hokumi had grabbed a vase from her console table and smashed it over his head. He stumbled backwards and once again, she gave him a few to the body before a headshot to be safe. This time he bled out on her marble floor, but it couldn’t be helped. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t mind getting her hands dirty, but she knew the active bounty on Jesse needed to be taken care of or else Hokumi knew eventually she’d come across an actual professional that she couldn’t so easily kill. In the meantime,  she gave what these low level hitmen deserved for belittling her. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi retired to her room to change into a clean set of clothes and dialed a clean up crew while she was there. Then she decided she would call in the ultimate favor to a long-time acquaintance of hers. She didn’t care how, but she knew he could take care of the situation. Hokumi knew Tanaka Juri felt that he owed her that much anyways. Afterall he always felt responsible for the death of Hokumi’s only friend. </p><p> </p><p>After she took care of business, Hokumi returned to her guest. She didn’t know what she expected he would do in her absence, but it turned out he had truly entrusted his life to her and went on to take a shower. He didn’t have clean clothes to change into so Jesse could only change back into his stained suit. Jesse truly couldn’t muster the energy to get fully dressed so his shirt was only minimally clad to his body as he lay sprawled on the bed, legs hanging over the side and fully exhausted. </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi coughed to announce her presence even though she had knocked prior to entering. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t sleep, you probably have a concussion.” She set down a medical kit onto the night stand.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse let out a low grunt, a gold chain fell onto his bare chest as he sat up, the bruising even more apparent now that the grime had been cleaned off. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, you’re different from the night we met.” Jesse admits that he didn’t predict this twist of events. But he took a gamble on Hokumi. And he hoped he was right. </p><p> </p><p>“Well these are not exactly normal circumstances, are they?” </p><p> </p><p>“That’s fair.” </p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, their eyes meet. For a few seconds, they realize how dangerously close they’ve gotten in the span of the night. Hokumi had killed people for Jesse before calling in a favor to someone who was famous to be a neutral party. Frankly, it was terrifying but neither couldn’t stop now.</p><p> </p><p>Hokumi offers to stitch some of his deeper cuts until he can get medical attention in the morning. Jesse asks off-handedly if she’s any good and Hokumi slides her sweater off one shoulder exposing a long scar that ran across her shoulder blade. She remarks that she had only worked on herself before but it turned out okay without raising so much as an eyebrow. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse doesn’t know why he experienced heart pain. Maybe it was the accumulation of every injury on his body, but he swore felt a dull wincing on his heart. While she looked for the right tool, he caught himself staring at her wondering what her story was. </p><p> </p><p>She tied her hair back with a rubber band she found in the kit and told Jesse she was going to stitch up the gash underneath the large bloodstain on his shirt. Hokumi intended to reach out to undo the few buttons but found herself hesitating. Jesse catches her reluctance to undress him, so he takes his own shirt off. His entire upper body looked like abstract art, splatters of colors everywhere on an otherwise chiseled canvas. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s going to hurt.” She sterilized the area and worked the needle into his flesh. </p><p> </p><p>He clenched the bedsheets at the first jab, but the pain only got numb as she went on. Jesse watched Hokumi work. It was ironic, but Jesse felt comforted for the first time in years. He forgot the last time someone stuck by his side and took care of him. In this moment, there wasn’t anyone more precious to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi stopped working for a split second, but continued. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll never let anything happen to you.” </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi couldn’t comprehend how she had only now fully realized that she yearned for this kind of devotion her entire life.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll protect you.”  </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi was beginning to fall in love. </p><p>

D: answer: I TOLD YOU. she has daddy issues. she wants to be treasured, she wants to be someone's baby girl. but because she had been denied that so long she gaslit herself into thinking she didn't want it.</p><p>oh, and daisies :) in case i dont get to talk about it later, jesse originally sends her daisies because the man doesn't know much about flowers. he asks the shop keeper which flowers last longest without needing a lot of care and personally, i've had daisies last forever in vases so i rolled with it. it was fitting because daisies also symbolize "loyal love" - something that jesse DID NOT know he would eventually give her, but does so because...now if that ain't fate &lt;3</p><p>lastly, a quick character recap because i know i threw a lot of names at y'all:<br/>- sato sousuke is jesse's grandfather. he has four kids: kazumi (eldest daughter), kaito (son), kana (jesse's mother), and kazuma (youngest son)<br/>- sato sousuke also has a sister - sato youko - jesse's grandaunt</p></blockquote>
