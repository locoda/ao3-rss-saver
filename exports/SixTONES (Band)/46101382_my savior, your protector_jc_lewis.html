      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Jesse Lewis returned from his imprisonment abroad with vengeance in mind when his grandfather finally dies and his hold over him ends. He swore to make every last of his enemies suffer for tearing his nuclear family apart and in the process, Jesse sought out Matsumura Hokumi, who had been the perfect choice for an ally. She was powerful, but isolated. Yet a twist in events changed the way their fates intertwined. Two incomplete people found each other and became each others' protector. A love that is a little toxic, a little broken, but perfect for two people who despite their rage at the world, only ever wanted love.</p></blockquote>

    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>There was an eerie full moon that night, illuminating the bayside with more gleam than usual. The sea breeze was strong too, carrying gusts of salt-filled wind across the otherwise barren shipyard, safe for the stacks of metal containers. Two men huddled in a small alley formed by these tall metal containers trying to keep their cigarettes lit on a smoke break. They had been sent by their boss to stake out at the location ahead of time. But they knew the location was secure. The big man paid to make sure it was, and since these two knew they decided to slack off.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you hear?” The skinnier one of the two asked, “The top boss is overseeing this personally tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>The other one let out a puff of smoke before half-heartedly replying, “What’s so special? Why would his lazy ass come? He never comes.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” The other smirks as though about to spill the world’s juiciest gossip, “You haven’t heard.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>There was usually little question when it came to who the most influential families were in Tokyo. Most people assumed it was either the Kyomotos’ old money or the Matsumuras’ shady businesses, but then they would be wrong. Underneath the guise of their daytime business, the Sato Corp was the true rising empire–and everything on the surface was merely the tip of the iceberg. People in the business knew. They would have heard that there was a new man in charge at the Satos’.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a new man at the top. A new face. I forgot his name.” </p><p> </p><p>The other man looked genuinely surprised. In a world where everyone works from bottom up, new faces seizing power was rare. He was a low level employee, so it really didn’t concern him but safe to say he was impressed, “What’s the guy’s deal?” </p><p> </p><p>“Dunno. Dunno where he’s from. Dunno what his background is. Heard he’s young. Blonde…I think he’s white. He took out the youngest Sato son.” </p><p> </p><p>“He killed him?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, he demoted him from chairman to director, idiot.” </p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>Before they could continue to shoot shit on the job, a loud honk interrupted them. The two men crushed their cigarettes in a hurry and hustled over to check out the disturbance. </p><p> </p><p>The deal was set to go down at midnight sharp. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis still trusted very few. </p><p> </p><p>When it was time for the trade to happen, he had only a select crew of handpicked people accompany him to the site. He checked his watch and the time was getting close, but Jesse decided to wait it out. He didn’t want to appear overzealous because he knew they wouldn’t take well to a new face, and a young foreigner at that. </p><p> </p><p>When they finally left at precisely quarter till, Jesse stood up, straightened his jacket and the entourage  followed suit, not one word being said. The air was thick, there was a strange tension and every one of his men felt chilled by how cold their new boss was. He never flashed his power, it wasn’t arrogance; it was pure confidence. </p><p> </p><p>They were all used to the ways of the former man in charge who flexed his authority at every opportunity, always making sure he had the biggest cock in the room. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse was quiet. He hardly said anything at all, yet they all knew to obey him. His very presence was authoritative enough, his gaze underneath the dirty blonde locks both willful and determined to conquer by all means necessary. It was laced with a bone-chilling ruthlessness that was hard to forget. </p><p> </p><p>His body language seemed to emit a dangerous aura like it was in everyone’s best interest to stay on his good side. Like he would burn you to pieces otherwise and that Jesse would see to it himself. Not a threat, but a promise. </p><p> </p><p>His right-hand man opened the car door for his boss and Jesse got in. Then the same man closed the door and headed to the second vehicle with the remainder of the people following him.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse briefly closed his eyes expecting their departure, but opened them again when his driver didn’t budge.</p><p> </p><p>“Kageyama, do we have a problem?” Jesse finally uttered, without so much as a glance at the driver.</p><p> </p><p>“S-sir, will it be just you?” Kageyama stuttered.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse briefly felt puzzled by the out-of-character question, but ultimately patiently nodded. His assistant didn’t dare say another word and began driving. From time to time he’d look into the rear mirror to steal glances at his boss, and all he’d see was Jesse resting his head against the seatback, eyes shut. Kageyama learned this was Jesse’s habit before these events, during the short period he served as his executive assistant. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama hoped that this was just another ordinary night for Jesse, to calm his own nerves yet little did he know Jesse has had a relentless pulsing in his right eyelid for hours. Jesse hated that he believed in superstition, given that he was only here because of his unpredictable behavior. </p><p> </p><p>But he had a bad feeling, deep down in his guts. </p><p> </p><p>He was well-aware that he walked into power with a blind confidence, but frankly Jesse didn’t care. He toyed with the gold ring on his index finger and despite his poker face, he tried to calm the weird sinking feeling he felt. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse knew maybe he could have spent the last decade preparing for an elaborate revenge and he could take down the people he despised in the worst misery. But he didn’t. Some nights he’d stay up wondering why he didn’t plan it, but then he would realize that defeated the whole point. Jesse didn’t want to play by rules; afterall  he lived full-heartedly believing death was always looming around the corner. If he didn’t die, he would win. </p><p> </p><p>When he opened his eyes, Jesse caught Kageyama looking at him in the rear mirror, before quickly darting his eyes away. Jesse was alert, but he didn’t think much of it. Before he could say anything, they had arrived at the location. The driver lowered the car window and exchanged a passage code before the security lifted the gate and they drove in. </p><p> </p><p>Not to their surprise, the other party had already been waiting there. As he got out of the car, his own people arrived in a separate van. </p><p> </p><p>“So you’re the new man in charge?” A voice appeared from the other side, his silhouette becoming more clear as he walked out from behind the blinding headlights of their vehicles. </p><p> </p><p>“Kai.” He tried to hide the surprise in his voice. Jesse was taken off guard as it was not who he expected to see, “What do you want?” </p><p> </p><p>“To form an alliance with you, of course.” The tone of the other man was sarcastic, almost mocking Jesse for even asking the question, “Aren’t you here to sell me that last shipment?” That last shipment was precious cargo. And insinuating Jesse would sell it to their competitor finally tipped him off on what was happening. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse tilted his head slightly, and in his peripheral vision he saw all the people behind him were unfamiliar faces. They weren’t his people at all, and it was starting to add up. The corner of his mouth curved upwards. </p><p> </p><p>“Not a good look on you, I have to say.” Jesse smirked, knowing exactly what was happening now. </p><p> </p><p>He’d been made.</p><p> </p><p>It was like Jesse predicted the way things were going to unfold and as though on cue his youngest uncle, his newest enemy, enters and suddenly all weapons are drawn on Jesse. </p><p> </p><p>“You look desperate.” Jesse doesn’t seem fazed at this turn of events. </p><p> </p><p>“And you look like a dead man.” </p><p> </p><p>The youngest Sato son had always had a reputation for being short-tempered, so it made sense why he was the first to be pushed to this point but truth be told Jesse was not expecting a set-up this quickly after he rose to power. </p><p> </p><p>“It looks bad for you.” Sato Kazuma couldn’t resist an evil smile as he held up what was supposed to be evidence that Jesse was crossing the family. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had been a pain in his side since the day he showed up and aggressively ripped the power out of his hands. Sato Kazuma thought it was finally his day to shine when his old man passed. When he was focusing all his energy on taking down his older brother, Jesse Lewis appeared out of nowhere and seized power in the chaos.</p><p> </p><p>The bastard son of his useless older sister. </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, he was eager to make his nephew disappear. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ve always been the dumb one. Living up your name.” Jesse chuckled, seemingly amused by what should have been a perilous situation. He should’ve known his hot-tempered uncle who only knows violence in his pea-sized brain would try to eliminate him by literally killing him. </p><p> </p><p>“You should go back to being a bastard child.” Kazuma snickered. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse admits he slipped up. But he was never one to cry over spilled milk. Rather his mind was on finding the mole in his inner circle that crossed him. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama. Jesse Lewis needed to see to his death. </p><p> </p><p>“Boys. House rules.” Kazuma exclaimed, filled with a passion and excitement as he fixed his cuff sleeve and retired into his car, “Traitors are executed. Take out the trash.”</p><p> </p><p>Kai followed, and the real traitor left with the enemy. God knows what they were up to next. Jesse scoffed at the pair; it truly takes a snake to know a snake. </p><p> </p><p>Dozens of low level henchmen began to swarm Jesse who fended himself with a broken fragment of plywood until that gave out. He then tried to flee by running towards the metal containers. Jesse was thankful that at the least the standard issue weapon was just a knife or a bat, alas he was very outnumbered, so he took a brutal beating before he could clear himself of the people who were after him. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse immediately looked for the car he came in, ready to go after the son of bitch who sold him. The salt filled wind blowing against his newly torn open flesh stung, but after circling the pier a few times he finally found the vehicle. Jesse knew luck would be on his side after all because the man he was looking for was still in the car. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse pushed his bloody blonde locks back and approached the driver side of the car. Before Kageyama could react and flee the vehicle, Jesse threw the car door open and dragged the man out by the collar. He tossed him onto the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood before brutally kicking his former employee in the guts numerous times. </p><p> </p><p>Kageyama didn’t fight back; deep down his loyalty was still with Jesse. Such was life on the dark side. He had been threatened by Kazuma to sell out his boss, but Jesse wasn’t having any of it. </p><p> </p><p>“I-I can expla..in.” The man on the ground gasped for air, “I can explain.” </p><p> </p><p>“No need.” At first it was half a hunch, but now Jesse was certain. </p><p> </p><p>His former boss pushed the bottom of his shoe against Kageyama’s cheek, literally stepping down on his face until he ran out of energy to fight back. This beating wasn’t for show and it certainly wasn’t simply to teach him a lesson then let him go. Jesse’s eyes grew cold; the anger had entirely subsided and he bent over, studying Kageyama’s now swollen yet terrified face for a split second before he lifted the pant leg of the foot resting on the man’s face. He drew a gun on him point blank and ended his misery. </p><p> </p><p>He tucked away his firearm, his neat dress shirt now stained with patches of crimson and his chiseled face now frayed with bruises. Jesse planned to escape on water, hijacking one of the yachts parked in the shallow parts of the bay. He dashed towards the main road but before he could react, a blinding headlight came towards him, slowing down before it hit him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh precious nephew. You should’ve chosen sides better.” Kazuma sadistically remarked from behind the wheel before he called in a few people to drag Jesse into custody. He should’ve killed Jesse, but he decided to have fun. It was family bonding time. He laughed maniacally.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Jesse came to, he felt like his head would split open and his ears rang endlessly, adding to the headache. He shook his head in an attempt to focus his vision, and when it finally came into focus, he realized he was tied onto a chair in an abandoned factory. His best guess was he was still near the shipyard. When he heard his uncle’s voice, Jesse confirmed that hypothesis as his uncle lacked brain cells for anything spectacular. </p><p> </p><p>“You just couldn’t let me die, huh” Jesse had the first words, despite the pain that throbbed against every inch of his body.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not.” Kazuma slowly walked into the building, like he was some kind of super villain and that was the part that made Jesse want to hurl the most. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret it.” </p><p> </p><p>“I <em> wish </em> you would stop acting so tough! You’re cornered! ” He continued to raise his voice, “Can’t you see you have no way out?!” He was filled to the brim with a manic laugh. Once he was within Jesse’s proximity, he kicked the chair and it toppled over, with Jesse still tied to it. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse hacked up a bloody cough before laughing.</p><p> </p><p>This triggered Kazuma, who behaved like an elementary bully who hadn’t gotten his way. He harshly kicked his nephew, sending him abruptly sliding a few feet away. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse laid on the floor limply, but then he looked up at his captor and revealed a smile, blood between his teeth, “Kill me, will you?” He taunted. </p><p> </p><p>This infuriated him more and took the fun out of the beating, so Kazuma turned and punched the subordinate who had been standing beside him out of frustration that his new toy was misbehaving. </p><p> </p><p>“Kill him. I’m done.” </p><p> </p><p>He left in a hurry after those words, “So boring.” He muttered as he pulled out his phone to dial up the brothel he frequented asking them to send over girls to his place. </p><p> </p><p>Once their boss left, the subordinates got to work. The same pair who had been sent to stake out at the site were left to kill the man who was supposedly the new top boss. Jesse truly was ready to pass out from the damage he sustained, but he still was only pretending to lay limply while the two men came over to fetch him. One untied him and they began to drag him outside, planning to execute him then toss into the Tokyo bay. </p><p> </p><p>But they didn’t unarm him thoroughly after hitting him with a car. Jesse “woke up” and took the two by surprise. He pulled an army swiss knife on them, stabbing one in the eye and while he shrieked, the other tried to run and Jesse planted the knife in his thigh, causing him to topple over clutching his leg. He quickly searched the man for car keys before stumbling outside, everything still spinning from the collision. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse found the car and sped away as soon as he could muster the energy to do so. He simply drove until he found familiar roads and then he pulled over at an inning to clear his head. </p><p> </p><p>He groaned as he pulled his tie off, wincing at the fresh wounds and the blood that had now dried on his face and hands. By now word must have spread and the whole organization must have labeled him as a traitor. Jesse was certain, however, that his pea-brained uncle didn’t have much on him. But Kazuma was like a child, too easy to anger, so Jesse needed somewhere safe to lay low until he could go back to fix the problem. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse had allies, but they were also people he needed to protect from Kazuma. He didn’t know why, but deep down there was one place that came to mind and he was drawn there like a magnet. A place he should least trust yet Jesse had been there more times than he cared to admit in the last few weeks.</p><p> </p><p>He knew the way by heart. </p><p> </p><p>He had no time to spare. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After driving through several small roads leading up to the mansion, Jesse parked his car by a roadside ditch and limped his way to the house. The car would be tracked at some point, so he best dump it anyway. Once he got close enough, he stopped to look at the mansion. It was 3am but the lights were still on. Jesse would know, he watched the house one too many nights. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse even knew that the housekeeper slept in a separate house with the rest of the family that took care of the house. He knew there could only be one person who came to the door. </p><p> </p><p>When the security headed towards the south side of the mansion, Jesse climbed the shorter walls on the north end and walked right up the marble doorsteps. He didn’t think this was how they’d meet again, but there was a part of him that wanted to trust so badly. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse firmly knocked a few times, before collapsing onto the steps. Fatigue was beginning to get the best of him, and he only regained consciousness from a haze when he heard the door open after an hour. </p><p> </p><p>In the dead of the night, Matsumura Hokumi stood barefoot in her nightgown, her dark brown curls blowing in the night breeze, and a bloody man collapsed at her doorsteps. </p><p> </p><p>Jesse Lewis. </p><p> </p><p>Before he could open his mouth, Hokumi beat him to it, “Please go die on a different set of doorsteps.” Hokumi coldly said, gathering her thin robe closer against her body and tried to close the door, but Jesse shot up and stopped her. </p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t you the least bit curious–” </p><p> </p><p>Hokumi hesitated. She didn’t know why. She barely knew this man. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know where else to go.” And for someone who always had his guard up, those were honest words from Jesse. And Hokumi knew. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re a wanted man. I could kill you right now.” Turns out the word had long spread that there was a huge bounty out on Jesse right now. Hokumi may not be the most powerful of the Matsumuras, but she still heard things. </p><p> </p><p>“I would collect a hefty bounty and then I’d get on good terms with your uncle.” She proposed, seeming absolute, that she would do just that despite being a petite woman standing in her nightgown in front of a man who towered over her. Somehow it was absolutely convincing, but Jesse didn’t believe it for a second. </p><p> </p><p>She looked up at him, right in the eyes,  “What makes you think I won’t do just that?”</p><p> </p><p>“You won’t.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you and I aren’t much different.” </p><p> </p><p>Jesse could feel her grip on the door loosen and without another word, she turned around and walked away, leaving the door wide open. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokumi was not one to perform acts of kindness out of the tenderness of her heart, yet something about Jesse haunted her. The way wisps of his presence seemed to weave its way into her guarded heart. She wanted to submit. </p><p><br/>
