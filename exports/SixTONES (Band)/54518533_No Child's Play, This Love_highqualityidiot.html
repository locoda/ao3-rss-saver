<div class="userstuff">
<p>”Now, we’re going to the big supermarket, and there are lots of people, so I need you to hold on to the cart or you’ll get lost.”</p><p>Shintaro crouched down in front of his four-year-old daughter to properly get her attention and quickly stroked her pigtail.</p><p>”Understand, Chiyo?”</p><p>”Un,” the girl nodded. She had a habit of wandering off if she saw something interesting, and it wasn’t once or twice when Shintaro had been searching for her at a beach or park or playground in full panic. He wouldn’t want to repeat that now at their new, nearby supermarket.</p><p>”Alright then, papa will get the cart and then we can go.”</p><p>It went fine for the first fifteen minutes or so. Chiyo walked nicely by the cart while Shintaro picked some bread, vegetables and meat for them. Since the store was new, he didn’t know the location of certain products so they had to walk back and forth a couple times.</p><p>”Chiyo, do you want to sit in the cart? Are you tired?” Shintaro tried even though he could guess the answer already.</p><p>”No!” the girl said right away. ”I want to walk.”</p><p>”Alright then… Let’s go look for coffee.”</p><p>”Papa, can we buy Chiikawa candy?”</p><p>”Let’s see. It’s not weekend…”</p><p>Shintaro finally found the right aisle for coffee and spices and turned the cart between the shelves. There was a nice offer for the coffee he liked to drink, so he happily added two packages in the cart before turning to browse the spice shelf. As he squatted down in front of the shelf, he glanced towards their cart and his stomach dropped when he noticed the cart side was empty.</p><p>”Oh shi-… Chiyo?”</p><p>Shintaro looked back and forth between the current aisle and then hurried to the next one to see if the girl had just fallen behind. She wasn’t there either.</p><p>”Chiyo!”</p><p>The familiar worry twisted his stomach, even though Shintaro’s rational side knew that she was close by somewhere and most likely couldn’t wander out of the store by herself. He asked the nearby older couple if they’d seen a small girl with a yellow jacket, but they hadn’t.</p><p>Shintaro left the cart and hurried back to the main aisle, where he tried to spot a small figure among the other customers and carts. He passed the sweets aisle to check if the girl had wandered there in search for her favorite candy, but only saw older kids there. Shintaro could feel his anxiety level rising by the second, and he was just considering informing the staff about the missing child, when an announcement cut through the regular advertisements and store music:</p><p>
<i>4-year-old Chiyo is waiting for his father by the cashier counters.</i>
</p><p>”Thank God,” Shintaro muttered. ”Cashier, cashier…”</p><p>He spun around, trying to figure out which direction to hurry to.</p><p>”Cashiers are that way, son,” an old lady near him pointed to the aisle on his right.</p><p>”Ah, thank you so much!” Shintaro bowed quickly and sped to the direction the lady had pointed.</p><p>—</p><p>Hokuto had come to the supermarket to look for a quick lunch, but had been distracted by the skincare shelf. He was reading the description for a new foam cleanser when he noticed a small child loitering nearby. She appeared to be alone, and was looking around, looking a bit lost. Hokuto also glanced around him but didn’t see anyone who could be her parent. He hesitated a few seconds, then put the cleanser back on the shelf.</p><p>Hokuto approached the girl with a friendly smile and bent down a bit to speak to her.</p><p>”Hello. Are you alone? Where is your mama?”</p><p>The girl glanced at him cautiously under her bangs. She had big bright eyes and cute pigtails. She pouted a little and shook her head slightly.</p><p>Hokuto wasn't sure what the shake meant so he tried another approach, crouching down properly to be on her eye level.</p><p>”My name is Hokuto. What’s yours?”</p><p>Again he got a long, estimating look as an answer. But then the girl said in the tiniest voice: ”Chiyo.”</p><p>”Chiyo-chan? Nice to meet you.” Hokuto smiled.</p><p>”Would you come with me to look for mama?”</p><p>Chiyo shook her head again. ”Papa.”</p><p>”Ah, you’re looking for papa! Okay. Shall we go together?”</p><p>Hokuto offered his hand for the child, already prepared to be rejected, but to his surprise Chiyo grabbed the hold of his fingers. Her hand was smooth and so small compared to his own, and Hokuto kind of wanted to cry at the sight. Usually he didn’t even care for kids that much. But right then, he was ready to protect this cute girl and make sure that she found her father as soon as possible.</p><p>Hokuto walked with Chiyo to the cashier counters where he found a staff member. He asked for them to make an announcement about the lost child so the father could come and pick her up.</p><p>”Ah, understood,” the staff guy said and then bent down and offered his hand for Chiyo.</p><p>”Would you come with me?”</p><p>To Hokuto’s and the staff member’s surprise, Chiyo shook her head and grabbed the hem of Hokuto’s coat and pressed against his leg shyly.</p><p>”Oh, it’s okay,” Hokuto said quickly, ”I can wait here with her. I’m not in a hurry.”</p><p>”If you’re sure, sir. I’ll go make the announcement. Please wait here for a moment.” Bowing, the staff guy hurried off and Hokuto was left with Chiyo.</p><p>He looked down at her and carefully patted her head. ”It’s okay, papa will come here in a moment.”</p><p>Or so he really hoped.</p><p>But indeed, only a mere minute or so after the announcement, Hokuto saw a young man hastily appearing between the shelves, clearly looking for something or someone. When he spotted them, his face brightened instantly and he strode closer.</p><p>”Chiyo! Where did you go? Papa was worried.”</p><p>Hokuto couldn’t help staring at the guy. He didn’t know what he had expected of this cute girl’s father, but definitely someone older and… less hot. The guy was around his age, with dyed high-lighted hair, a goatee beard and a sporty yet cool outfit.</p><p>The guy knelt down in front of Chiyo and stroked her cheek gently.</p><p>”You shouldn’t wander off, you little rascal.”</p><p>Then the guy looked up at Hokuto, and Hokuto could immediately tell where the girl had gotten her big round eyes from.</p><p>”So sorry for the trouble! She has a habit of getting lost…”</p><p>”Not at all!” Hokuto said immediately. ”I’m happy we found you so quickly. She’s very cute.”</p><p>The guy chuckled and stood up. ”Yeah. A lot of work at times though. Chiyo, say thanks to this nice oniisan.”</p><p>”Thank you, Hokuto-oniisan,” the girl said obediently.</p><p>”No problem,” Hokuto said, bending down to smile at the girl. Chiyo smiled shyly back at him before hiding her face behind his father’s leg. Hokuto and the guy laughed.</p><p>”Already on a first name basis?” The guy sounded a bit surprised and stroked Chiyo’s hair. ”She’s usually very timid around strangers, doesn’t even talk to them, so she seems to like you.”</p><p>”Ah, really? Well, I’m glad if so.”</p><p>”I’m Shintaro, by the way. We live nearby so this is our new closest supermarket.”</p><p>That was definitely nice to know, Hokuto thought when looking at the guy’s radiant smile. He wouldn’t mind running into him (and Chiyo) again.</p><p>”Matsumura Hokuto,” Hokuto said, nodding his head. ”This is my nearest store, too.”</p><p>”Cool, maybe we’ll see each other here again, then,” Shintaro said. Jokingly or not, Hokuto couldn’t tell, but his friendly tone was encouraging.</p><p>”Hopefully we do,” Hokuto said and meant it.</p><p>Next time, Hokuto thought when waving at Shintaro and his cute daughter, he’d ask the guy out for coffee.</p>

<p>Wagging its tail, a small poodle from the neighborhood greeted Hokuto by sniffing his shoes and yelping happily. Hokuto chuckled and let the dog sniff his hand quickly before its owner hurried them on along the walkway. Hokuto continued in the opposite direction, taking a sip of his takeaway coffee.</p><p>Hokuto was walking home from the train station, and for once he wasn’t in any hurry, so he took his time to enjoy the warm, sunny weather. He’d even taken a little detour on purpose. It was April, the cherry blossoms were already gone but nature was getting greener by the day while the <i>just right</i> spring warmth blessed the city.</p><p>The path took a turn towards a small playground, and Hokuto could hear a happy yell of a child there. He walked by a green metal fence, looking amusedly at a worn-out wooden Pikachu sign that warned about running children. The sign looked like it had stood there since Hokuto had been a toddler.</p><p>”Chiyo, careful!”</p><p>The sudden call almost made Hokuto jump; he’d been so concentrated on the sign that he hadn’t noticed the man in the playground at all.</p><p>It was Shintaro, with Chiyo.</p><p>Hokuto instantly stopped on his tracks, feeling an embarrassing jump in his gut when he looked at Shintaro. He’d been hoping he would run into the young father again properly. Since the first sudden encounter at the supermarket, he’d seen Shintaro at the train station and a couple times at the store again, but always briefly and from afar. But now… He tried observing the situation discreetly.</p><p>Shintaro was standing by a bench on the edge of the playground, keeping an eye on Chiyo, who was playing in the sandbox at the moment. Shintaro was casually dressed in joggers and a lime green windbreaker, and was sipping something from a tumbler. The playground was empty otherwise. Checking this, Hokuto’s mind automatically ran through countless different scenarios with him walking in and talking to Shintaro, and also him pretending not to notice and just striding by awkwardly. The latter option was what usually happened with him and his over-thinking, anxious mind.</p><p>Then again, Hokuto’s now relaxed and chipper mind pointed out, what was the worst thing that could happen? He’d get to talk to Shintaro anyway. He really, really wanted to. He breathed out slowly, and took a swig of his coffee for the nerves before starting off again.</p><p>Hokuto slid into the playground area, and approached Shintaro leisurely, allowing the other time to notice him. When Shintaro did, his face lit up cutely, and he gave Hokuto a wide smile.</p><p>“Hi! Long time no see!”</p><p>“Hello! I happened to walk by and noticed you guys here…”</p><p>“Small neighborhood, right?” Shintaro laughed. “Chiyo, look who’s here! Hokuto-oniisan!”</p><p>Chiyo looked their way, and Hokuto waved cheerfully at her, even though he wasn’t even sure she remembered him anymore. Chiyo gave him a haphazard wave and then went back to her sand cakes, making both Hokuto and Shintaro laugh.</p><p>“She loves the playground, would be here all day if allowed,” Shintaro told Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto smiled when looking at Chiyo’s playing. “I bet.”</p><p>“But how are you here on a random Thursday like this? A day off?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Hokuto said. “Took a detour home to enjoy the weather.”</p><p>“A nice coincidence, then,” Shintaro smiled. “I’ve seen you a couple times at the station or the supermarket, but you always look so busy.”</p><p>Hokuto was taken aback by that. “Ah, really? Y-you’ve seen me? As in, noticed me?”</p><p>“Sure! Actually it’s quite easy to spot you since you always look so stylish. You kinda stand out among tired office workers or parents like myself.”</p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know… But thank you,” Hokuto said, feeling his face heating up a bit at the sudden compliment. He knew “stylish” in this case meant his work day look and not his actual style, which was way louder and colorful and weird, but Hokuto appreciated it nonetheless.</p><p>He also couldn’t believe that Shintaro had spotted <i>him</i> around the neighborhood, like Hokuto had done with him. That, too, made his chest flutter embarrassingly… Hokuto sipped his coffee in a slight mental panic. He really should get a grip before falling head over heels for a cute neighborhood dad, who most likely had a beautiful and perfect wife at home.</p><p>Though, now that Hokuto thought about it, he had never seen Shintaro with anyone. It was always just him and Chiyo, just like today. He wondered if it would be nosy and impolite to ask about it.</p><p>Hokuto’s pondering was cut short by Chiyo, who strutted their way.</p><p>”Papa, I’m thirsty!” She announced.</p><p>”Oh? Do you want juice?” Shintaro grabbed his backpack and fished out a small juice carton. He stuck the straw in and handed the carton to Chiyo.</p><p>”Are you hungry? Do you want to go home?”</p><p>The girl promptly shook her head while drinking the juice. Then she turned towards Hokuto, eyeing him curiously. Hokuto smiled at her.</p><p>“Do you remember me, Chiyo-chan?”</p><p>She kept looking at him thoughtfully, so Shintaro helped out: “He was the nice oniisan at the supermarket. You remember?”</p><p>After a short silence, Chiyo nodded slowly and Hokuto happily beamed down at her, then at Shintaro. Then, he felt a small hand grabbing the hold of his fingers. Chiyo pulled on his hand, clearly wanting him to follow her.</p><p>“What is it?” Hokuto asked, again feeling this weird wave of gratitude over the fact that the little girl was so familiar with him.</p><p>“I want to swing,” Chiyo said.</p><p>Hokuto glanced at Shintaro, who just nodded encouragingly at him.</p><p>“Great, you go and play with her so I can chill here for a bit,” he said cheekily, sitting down on the bench and fishing out his phone.</p><p>“Hey!” Hokuto protested, though laughing, while letting Chiyo pull him towards the swings. He looked at Shintaro over his shoulder, at his wide smile and playful wave, and felt a sudden burst of boldness.</p><p>“I want coffee as compensation!” he called out to Shintaro.</p><p>“Deal,” the other said right away. “Whenever you’re free.”</p><p>Hokuto turned back towards Chiyo and bit back a smile, his heart fluttering so much his earlier resolution seemed quite useless already. A small casual crush never hurt anyone, right?</p>

<p>Soon again, Hokuto would be desperately pining after someone he couldn’t have. He knew that was a possibility.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>They had actually added each other on LINE after the playground meeting, so Hokuto was cautiously hopeful that he would get that coffee Shintaro had promised.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hey, and thanks for today! Chiyo was thrilled, idk if she will accept me as her play buddy anymore 😁</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hahaha! She’s so cute ☺️ I don’t mind playing with her again sometime</i>
</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>I’ll keep that in mind!<br/>Also, I’ll get back to you about the coffee?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Alright<br/>looking forward to that ☕️</i>
</p><p> </p><p>After the messages, a day passed, then another.</p><p>Then a week.</p><p>Hokuto opened the chat daily, wondering if he should send something. Countless times he started writing a message only to delete it right away, telling himself that Shintaro was most likely busy and wouldn’t have time to have a useless chat with Hokuto. He had mentioned about the coffee, so he wouldn’t forget about it. Right?</p><p>During the week, Hokuto tried his best to concentrate on working and not worrying about the nonexistent coffee date. He currently had minor roles in two different drama series, so the filming schedule was quite a busy one, taking him around the city from dawn till dusk all week.</p><p>By Saturday, Hokuto was completely exhausted. When his final filming for the week wrapped already around noon, he was dreaming of sleeping for the rest of the day and possibly the whole Sunday, too. But on the train home, he finally got the message he’d been waiting for the whole week.</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hi! What’s up?<br/>Sorry this is so last minute, but would you have time for the coffee tomorrow?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Sure, I’m free all day!<br/>What time?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Is 1pm good? We could meet by the west exit at the station</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Okay! See you 😄</i>
</p><p>Hokuto smiled at his phone when Shintaro sent a cute dog sticker as an answer. He wanted to whoop in victory but resisted in the crowded train.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was way too excited about <i>just grabbing a coffee</i>, he was aware of that. Thus, instead of spending the rest of the day sleeping like he’d first intended, he went through his wardrobe, worrying way too long for what he was going to wear. He knew what he’d want to wear: the one colorful sweater with a damaged look he had found recently at a vintage store. But come Sunday and after long consideration, Hokuto opted for a classic (though boring) style he usually wore for work, too, when he didn't want to stand out too much. Denim, black, white, nothing too loud or eccentric.</p><p>Despite the small outfit crisis, Hokuto was a bit early at the station. While waiting, he wondered about their café options, which weren’t great. There was a small, boring chain café by the opposite exit and another one at a mall nearby, and that was about it. The suburban problems.</p><p>Hokuto was just digging out his phone to check about other options, when a car right in front of the station honked, making him jump a little. Hokuto glanced up just in time to see the window rolling down and Shintaro looking out.</p><p>“Hi!” Shintaro greeted cheerfully.</p><p>“Hi,” Hokuto answered and walked up to the car, a bit dumbfounded. “Eh, you have a car?”</p><p>“Yep,” Shintaro smiled. “I thought I could drive us to this nice café my friend owns. It’s a bit farther so the car is faster than the train. If… that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“Oh. Y-yeah. Sure! That sounds good.”</p><p>Hokuto rounded the car and sat down in the front seat next to Shintaro. He was still quite surprised by the turn of events, but he had to admit this was a lot better than grabbing coffee from the café by the station.</p><p>He watched as Shintaro veered the car out of the station area, and thought to himself that someone driving shouldn’t have been as attractive as it was to him. Shintaro adjusted the radio volume and input the café’s address to the navigator.</p><p>“Sorry that it took some time to arrange this,” he then said. “The past week was pretty crazy, both work and family wise. Had some major deadlines at work and Chiyo had a small flu so she couldn’t be in the daycare...”</p><p>“Oh! Is she better already?”</p><p>“Yeah, luckily. She’s at my parents’ now for the weekend, so it’s rare free time for me.” Shintaro grinned while glancing at Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto hesitated some seconds before asking the question he’d been wondering about the most.</p><p>”So… it’s just you and her? If you don’t mind me asking?”</p><p>“No, not at all,” Shintaro said right away, sounding easy-going. “But yep, just me and her.”</p><p>Hokuto nodded slowly, suddenly unsure how to react or what to say. It was like he’d somewhat expected, but now he wasn’t sure how it made him feel. Dozens of new questions also popped into his mind. Shintaro seemed to interpret his silence correctly as he let out a short laugh.</p><p>“There’s nothing dramatic though. I had this friends-with-benefits thing with a girl back in university. We were careful, but somehow she got pregnant anyway. Well, we discussed it and decided to have the baby, but right before it was born, she felt that she wasn’t ready for it after all and was already thinking of giving the baby up for adoption. I did want it though, I had always wanted kids so I thought why not now. So it’s been just me and Chiyo from the start! Well, my family and especially mum has helped a lot along the way...”</p><p>“Wow…” Hokuto muttered, impressed and amazed. He thought of himself back in university and tried imagining that fellow with a newborn baby. It was impossible. “It must’ve been tough! All alone.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Shintaro shrugged. “It’s still tough, but that’s parenting for you. But it’s all worth it in the end.”</p><p>Shintaro’s smile was soft and Hokuto answered it, nodding silently, though of course he couldn’t even start imagining the hardships or joys of parenting. But he thought of Chiyo in the swings, giggling gleefully at him, and maybe he got it even a little bit.</p><p>“But enough about me! Or us. What about you?” Shintaro then asked. “What do you do? How did you end up in the same sleepy neighborhood?”</p><p>Hokuto chuckled. He wasn’t good at this, talking about himself, but Shintaro had just told about such personal stuff so he supposed he’d have to step up, too. He took a deep breath before answering.</p><p>“Well, I live there since the rent is quite cheap. And I’m an actor. Or that’s what I do most of the time.”</p><p>“What? Really?”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“You mean, you’ve been on TV and stuff?”</p><p>“Well, only in very small roles so far...”</p><p>“But that’s so cool!” Shintaro looked at him with widened eyes and an impressed look on his face. “You gotta tell me the dramas, I’ll check them out!”</p><p>“Alright,” Hokuto promised, smiling to himself. He hadn’t expected such an enthusiastic response, but it seemed that Shintaro liked watching dramas and movies. He proceeded on asking which productions Hokuto had been on and which celebrities he possibly knew (“You’re friends with <i>Kikuchi Fuma</i>? That’s nuts!”) and whether he could tell any backstage gossip.</p><p>Hokuto found it surprisingly easy to talk with Shintaro, with him being so easygoing, frank and sincere. He was genuinely interested in Hokuto’s job, and was impressed with his roles, though Hokuto himself didn’t really find his countless times as an extra or a minor background character that special. But Shintaro’s excited reaction warmed his heart anyway.</p><p>They chatted pleasantly all the way to the café, which turned out to be somewhere on the back alleys of Kichijoji. Shintaro parked the car and they walked the rest of the way to a small, fancy looking place with concrete floor, chipboard counter and walls full of colorful posters and flyers. The guy behind the counter was as colorful as the interior; a blue cap, bright orange T-shirt and neon colored accessories was a combination that amazed even Hokuto. The guy seemed to know Shintaro, as he exclaimed happily the moment they stepped in.</p><p>“Heey! Long time no see! Where have you been?”</p><p>“Oh, you know,” Shintaro sighed and leaned against the counter. “Juggling work and family.”</p><p>“Hmm, I get that. But nice to see you!”</p><p>“Likewise,” Shintaro smiled and then turned to Hokuto, introducing them. “This is Jesse. And this is Matsumura Hokuto. We live close by.”</p><p>Hokuto bowed at Jesse quickly, while Jesse’s eyebrows jumped comically and a wide grin spread on his face.</p><p>“Oh! Are you guys... you know...” He pointed a finger between Shintaro and Hokuto, grinning widely, and suddenly Hokuto felt his face growing hot.</p><p>“What? No, no!” Shintaro denied quickly, letting out a laugh that sounded a bit strained to Hokuto. He noticed Shintaro’s ear turning red. “Like I said, we live in the same area. He’s helped out with Chiyo a couple of times.”</p><p>“Alright, alright, just teasing a bit!” Jesse said, all chipper, and handed Hokuto the menu. “What can I get you?”</p><p>Hokuto scanned the menu card and panicked at the long list of different sorts of coffees and teas. In the end he just went with a basic cappuccino.</p><p>“I’ll get that for you, you can go and take a seat,” Shintaro told him and Hokuto thankfully hurried to a vacant table by the back wall. He sat down, still feeling a bit awkward after Jesse’s sudden suggestion at the counter. And sure, of course Shintaro would deny it, but it still stung somewhat. Hokuto looked at the counter and saw Shintaro chatting cheerfully with Jesse while the barista made their drinks. Hokuto had yet more questions in his mind.</p><p>After a moment, Shintaro walked to the table with their coffees, sitting down opposite Hokuto.</p><p>“Sorry about Jesse,” he apologized immediately in a low voice. “He has a weird sense of humor, and he’s half American, so sometimes there’s no filter whatsoever…”</p><p>Shintaro looked sincerely apologetic, and even a bit uneasy, so Hokuto gave him his best reassuring smile.</p><p>“No worries,” he convinced and took a sip of his coffee. He couldn’t help adding jokingly: “So do you usually bring all your dates to this café?”</p><p>Shintaro laughed heartily at that. “What dates? Haven’t really had any in years. That’s what single parenting does to you.”</p><p>Hokuto hummed at that. Understandable, he supposed. His small joke had managed to lighten the atmosphere again, and they fell easily back to their earlier conversation. All in all, it was a pleasant not-date. The coffee was good, and Hokuto enjoyed himself and Shintaro’s company.</p><p>He wouldn’t lie, he’d have liked it if it <i>had</i> been a date, but he supposed he’d just have to settle for being Shintaro’s friendly neighbor. Or maybe even a friend?</p><p>That would be good too, Hokuto thought when they were driving back from the café. Maybe his crush would fade away in time, like they usually did. He leaned languidly back in the seat, listening to Shintaro’s long story about a time Jesse had watched Chiyo for half a day, barely managing. Hokuto listened to Shintaro’s laughter and kept glancing at his handsome side profile or his hands on the steering wheel. It <i>would</i> fade...</p><p>Before dropping him off, when Shintaro suggested they should do this again some time, Hokuto happily agreed.</p><p>“And if you ever need help with Chiyo, like someone to watch over her, you can call me,” he said. “I think I could manage with her.”</p><p>“You definitely could,” Shintaro agreed. “Much better than Jesse, I’m sure. Thanks!”</p><p>After one last smile and a wave, Shintaro drove off, and Hokuto was left alone with his overthinking mind and pining heart.</p>
