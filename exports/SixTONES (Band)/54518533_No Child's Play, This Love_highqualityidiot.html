<div class="userstuff">
<p>”Now, we’re going to the big supermarket, and there are lots of people, so I need you to hold on to the cart or you’ll get lost.”</p><p>Shintaro crouched down in front of his four-year-old daughter to properly get her attention and quickly stroked her pigtail.</p><p>”Understand, Chiyo?”</p><p>”Un,” the girl nodded. She had a habit of wandering off if she saw something interesting, and it wasn’t once or twice when Shintaro had been searching for her at a beach or park or playground in full panic. He wouldn’t want to repeat that now at their new, nearby supermarket.</p><p>”Alright then, papa will get the cart and then we can go.”</p><p>It went fine for the first fifteen minutes or so. Chiyo walked nicely by the cart while Shintaro picked some bread, vegetables and meat for them. Since the store was new, he didn’t know the location of certain products so they had to walk back and forth a couple times.</p><p>”Chiyo, do you want to sit in the cart? Are you tired?” Shintaro tried even though he could guess the answer already.</p><p>”No!” the girl said right away. ”I want to walk.”</p><p>”Alright then… Let’s go look for coffee.”</p><p>”Papa, can we buy Chiikawa candy?”</p><p>”Let’s see. It’s not weekend…”</p><p>Shintaro finally found the right aisle for coffee and spices and turned the cart between the shelves. There was a nice offer for the coffee he liked to drink, so he happily added two packages in the cart before turning to browse the spice shelf. As he squatted down in front of the shelf, he glanced towards their cart and his stomach dropped when he noticed the cart side was empty.</p><p>”Oh shi-… Chiyo?”</p><p>Shintaro looked back and forth between the current aisle and then hurried to the next one to see if the girl had just fallen behind. She wasn’t there either.</p><p>”Chiyo!”</p><p>The familiar worry twisted his stomach, even though Shintaro’s rational side knew that she was close by somewhere and most likely couldn’t wander out of the store by herself. He asked the nearby older couple if they’d seen a small girl with a yellow jacket, but they hadn’t.</p><p>Shintaro left the cart and hurried back to the main aisle, where he tried to spot a small figure among the other customers and carts. He passed the sweets aisle to check if the girl had wandered there in search for her favorite candy, but only saw older kids there. Shintaro could feel his anxiety level rising by the second, and he was just considering informing the staff about the missing child, when an announcement cut through the regular advertisements and store music:</p><p>
<i>4-year-old Chiyo is waiting for his father by the cashier counters.</i>
</p><p>”Thank God,” Shintaro muttered. ”Cashier, cashier…”</p><p>He spun around, trying to figure out which direction to hurry to.</p><p>”Cashiers are that way, son,” an old lady near him pointed to the aisle on his right.</p><p>”Ah, thank you so much!” Shintaro bowed quickly and sped to the direction the lady had pointed.</p><p>—</p><p>Hokuto had come to the supermarket to look for a quick lunch, but had been distracted by the skincare shelf. He was reading the description for a new foam cleanser when he noticed a small child loitering nearby. She appeared to be alone, and was looking around, looking a bit lost. Hokuto also glanced around him but didn’t see anyone who could be her parent. He hesitated a few seconds, then put the cleanser back on the shelf.</p><p>Hokuto approached the girl with a friendly smile and bent down a bit to speak to her.</p><p>”Hello. Are you alone? Where is your mama?”</p><p>The girl glanced at him cautiously under her bangs. She had big bright eyes and cute pigtails. She pouted a little and shook her head slightly.</p><p>Hokuto wasn't sure what the shake meant so he tried another approach, crouching down properly to be on her eye level.</p><p>”My name is Hokuto. What’s yours?”</p><p>Again he got a long, estimating look as an answer. But then the girl said in the tiniest voice: ”Chiyo.”</p><p>”Chiyo-chan? Nice to meet you.” Hokuto smiled.</p><p>”Would you come with me to look for mama?”</p><p>Chiyo shook her head again. ”Papa.”</p><p>”Ah, you’re looking for papa! Okay. Shall we go together?”</p><p>Hokuto offered his hand for the child, already prepared to be rejected, but to his surprise Chiyo grabbed the hold of his fingers. Her hand was smooth and so small compared to his own, and Hokuto kind of wanted to cry at the sight. Usually he didn’t even care for kids that much. But right then, he was ready to protect this cute girl and make sure that she found her father as soon as possible.</p><p>Hokuto walked with Chiyo to the cashier counters where he found a staff member. He asked for them to make an announcement about the lost child so the father could come and pick her up.</p><p>”Ah, understood,” the staff guy said and then bent down and offered his hand for Chiyo.</p><p>”Would you come with me?”</p><p>To Hokuto’s and the staff member’s surprise, Chiyo shook her head and grabbed the hem of Hokuto’s coat and pressed against his leg shyly.</p><p>”Oh, it’s okay,” Hokuto said quickly, ”I can wait here with her. I’m not in a hurry.”</p><p>”If you’re sure, sir. I’ll go make the announcement. Please wait here for a moment.” Bowing, the staff guy hurried off and Hokuto was left with Chiyo.</p><p>He looked down at her and carefully patted her head. ”It’s okay, papa will come here in a moment.”</p><p>Or so he really hoped.</p><p>But indeed, only a mere minute or so after the announcement, Hokuto saw a young man hastily appearing between the shelves, clearly looking for something or someone. When he spotted them, his face brightened instantly and he strode closer.</p><p>”Chiyo! Where did you go? Papa was worried.”</p><p>Hokuto couldn’t help staring at the guy. He didn’t know what he had expected of this cute girl’s father, but definitely someone older and… less hot. The guy was around his age, with dyed high-lighted hair, a goatee beard and a sporty yet cool outfit.</p><p>The guy knelt down in front of Chiyo and stroked her cheek gently.</p><p>”You shouldn’t wander off, you little rascal.”</p><p>Then the guy looked up at Hokuto, and Hokuto could immediately tell where the girl had gotten her big round eyes from.</p><p>”So sorry for the trouble! She has a habit of getting lost…”</p><p>”Not at all!” Hokuto said immediately. ”I’m happy we found you so quickly. She’s very cute.”</p><p>The guy chuckled and stood up. ”Yeah. A lot of work at times though. Chiyo, say thanks to this nice oniisan.”</p><p>”Thank you, Hokuto-oniisan,” the girl said obediently.</p><p>”No problem,” Hokuto said, bending down to smile at the girl. Chiyo smiled shyly back at him before hiding her face behind his father’s leg. Hokuto and the guy laughed.</p><p>”Already on a first name basis?” The guy sounded a bit surprised and stroked Chiyo’s hair. ”She’s usually very timid around strangers, doesn’t even talk to them, so she seems to like you.”</p><p>”Ah, really? Well, I’m glad if so.”</p><p>”I’m Shintaro, by the way. We live nearby so this is our new closest supermarket.”</p><p>That was definitely nice to know, Hokuto thought when looking at the guy’s radiant smile. He wouldn’t mind running into him (and Chiyo) again.</p><p>”Matsumura Hokuto,” Hokuto said, nodding his head. ”This is my nearest store, too.”</p><p>”Cool, maybe we’ll see each other here again, then,” Shintaro said. Jokingly or not, Hokuto couldn’t tell, but his friendly tone was encouraging.</p><p>”Hopefully we do,” Hokuto said and meant it.</p><p>Next time, Hokuto thought when waving at Shintaro and his cute daughter, he’d ask the guy out for coffee.</p>

<p>Wagging its tail, a small poodle from the neighborhood greeted Hokuto by sniffing his shoes and yelping happily. Hokuto chuckled and let the dog sniff his hand quickly before its owner hurried them on along the walkway. Hokuto continued in the opposite direction, taking a sip of his takeaway coffee.</p><p>Hokuto was walking home from the train station, and for once he wasn’t in any hurry, so he took his time to enjoy the warm, sunny weather. He’d even taken a little detour on purpose. It was April, the cherry blossoms were already gone but nature was getting greener by the day while the <i>just right</i> spring warmth blessed the city.</p><p>The path took a turn towards a small playground, and Hokuto could hear a happy yell of a child there. He walked by a green metal fence, looking amusedly at a worn-out wooden Pikachu sign that warned about running children. The sign looked like it had stood there since Hokuto had been a toddler.</p><p>”Chiyo, careful!”</p><p>The sudden call almost made Hokuto jump; he’d been so concentrated on the sign that he hadn’t noticed the man in the playground at all.</p><p>It was Shintaro, with Chiyo.</p><p>Hokuto instantly stopped on his tracks, feeling an embarrassing jump in his gut when he looked at Shintaro. He’d been hoping he would run into the young father again properly. Since the first sudden encounter at the supermarket, he’d seen Shintaro at the train station and a couple times at the store again, but always briefly and from afar. But now… He tried observing the situation discreetly.</p><p>Shintaro was standing by a bench on the edge of the playground, keeping an eye on Chiyo, who was playing in the sandbox at the moment. Shintaro was casually dressed in joggers and a lime green windbreaker, and was sipping something from a tumbler. The playground was empty otherwise. Checking this, Hokuto’s mind automatically ran through countless different scenarios with him walking in and talking to Shintaro, and also him pretending not to notice and just striding by awkwardly. The latter option was what usually happened with him and his over-thinking, anxious mind.</p><p>Then again, Hokuto’s now relaxed and chipper mind pointed out, what was the worst thing that could happen? He’d get to talk to Shintaro anyway. He really, really wanted to. He breathed out slowly, and took a swig of his coffee for the nerves before starting off again.</p><p>Hokuto slid into the playground area, and approached Shintaro leisurely, allowing the other time to notice him. When Shintaro did, his face lit up cutely, and he gave Hokuto a wide smile.</p><p>“Hi! Long time no see!”</p><p>“Hello! I happened to walk by and noticed you guys here…”</p><p>“Small neighborhood, right?” Shintaro laughed. “Chiyo, look who’s here! Hokuto-oniisan!”</p><p>Chiyo looked their way, and Hokuto waved cheerfully at her, even though he wasn’t even sure she remembered him anymore. Chiyo gave him a haphazard wave and then went back to her sand cakes, making both Hokuto and Shintaro laugh.</p><p>“She loves the playground, would be here all day if allowed,” Shintaro told Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto smiled when looking at Chiyo’s playing. “I bet.”</p><p>“But how are you here on a random Thursday like this? A day off?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Hokuto said. “Took a detour home to enjoy the weather.”</p><p>“A nice coincidence, then,” Shintaro smiled. “I’ve seen you a couple times at the station or the supermarket, but you always look so busy.”</p><p>Hokuto was taken aback by that. “Ah, really? Y-you’ve seen me? As in, noticed me?”</p><p>“Sure! Actually it’s quite easy to spot you since you always look so stylish. You kinda stand out among tired office workers or parents like myself.”</p><p>“Hmm, I don’t know… But thank you,” Hokuto said, feeling his face heating up a bit at the sudden compliment. He knew “stylish” in this case meant his work day look and not his actual style, which was way louder and colorful and weird, but Hokuto appreciated it nonetheless.</p><p>He also couldn’t believe that Shintaro had spotted <i>him</i> around the neighborhood, like Hokuto had done with him. That, too, made his chest flutter embarrassingly… Hokuto sipped his coffee in a slight mental panic. He really should get a grip before falling head over heels for a cute neighborhood dad, who most likely had a beautiful and perfect wife at home.</p><p>Though, now that Hokuto thought about it, he had never seen Shintaro with anyone. It was always just him and Chiyo, just like today. He wondered if it would be nosy and impolite to ask about it.</p><p>Hokuto’s pondering was cut short by Chiyo, who strutted their way.</p><p>”Papa, I’m thirsty!” She announced.</p><p>”Oh? Do you want juice?” Shintaro grabbed his backpack and fished out a small juice carton. He stuck the straw in and handed the carton to Chiyo.</p><p>”Are you hungry? Do you want to go home?”</p><p>The girl promptly shook her head while drinking the juice. Then she turned towards Hokuto, eyeing him curiously. Hokuto smiled at her.</p><p>“Do you remember me, Chiyo-chan?”</p><p>She kept looking at him thoughtfully, so Shintaro helped out: “He was the nice oniisan at the supermarket. You remember?”</p><p>After a short silence, Chiyo nodded slowly and Hokuto happily beamed down at her, then at Shintaro. Then, he felt a small hand grabbing the hold of his fingers. Chiyo pulled on his hand, clearly wanting him to follow her.</p><p>“What is it?” Hokuto asked, again feeling this weird wave of gratitude over the fact that the little girl was so familiar with him.</p><p>“I want to swing,” Chiyo said.</p><p>Hokuto glanced at Shintaro, who just nodded encouragingly at him.</p><p>“Great, you go and play with her so I can chill here for a bit,” he said cheekily, sitting down on the bench and fishing out his phone.</p><p>“Hey!” Hokuto protested, though laughing, while letting Chiyo pull him towards the swings. He looked at Shintaro over his shoulder, at his wide smile and playful wave, and felt a sudden burst of boldness.</p><p>“I want coffee as compensation!” he called out to Shintaro.</p><p>“Deal,” the other said right away. “Whenever you’re free.”</p><p>Hokuto turned back towards Chiyo and bit back a smile, his heart fluttering so much his earlier resolution seemed quite useless already. A small casual crush never hurt anyone, right?</p>

<p>Soon again, Hokuto would be desperately pining after someone he couldn’t have. He knew that was a possibility.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>They had actually added each other on LINE after the playground meeting, so Hokuto was cautiously hopeful that he would get that coffee Shintaro had promised.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hey, and thanks for today! Chiyo was thrilled, idk if she will accept me as her play buddy anymore 😁</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hahaha! She’s so cute ☺️ I don’t mind playing with her again sometime</i>
</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>I’ll keep that in mind!<br/>Also, I’ll get back to you about the coffee?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Alright<br/>looking forward to that ☕️</i>
</p><p> </p><p>After the messages, a day passed, then another.</p><p>Then a week.</p><p>Hokuto opened the chat daily, wondering if he should send something. Countless times he started writing a message only to delete it right away, telling himself that Shintaro was most likely busy and wouldn’t have time to have a useless chat with Hokuto. He had mentioned about the coffee, so he wouldn’t forget about it. Right?</p><p>During the week, Hokuto tried his best to concentrate on working and not worrying about the nonexistent coffee date. He currently had minor roles in two different drama series, so the filming schedule was quite a busy one, taking him around the city from dawn till dusk all week.</p><p>By Saturday, Hokuto was completely exhausted. When his final filming for the week wrapped already around noon, he was dreaming of sleeping for the rest of the day and possibly the whole Sunday, too. But on the train home, he finally got the message he’d been waiting for the whole week.</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Hi! What’s up?<br/>Sorry this is so last minute, but would you have time for the coffee tomorrow?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Sure, I’m free all day!<br/>What time?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b>
<br/>
<i>Is 1pm good? We could meet by the west exit at the station</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b>
<br/>
<i>Okay! See you 😄</i>
</p><p>Hokuto smiled at his phone when Shintaro sent a cute dog sticker as an answer. He wanted to whoop in victory but resisted in the crowded train.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was way too excited about <i>just grabbing a coffee</i>, he was aware of that. Thus, instead of spending the rest of the day sleeping like he’d first intended, he went through his wardrobe, worrying way too long for what he was going to wear. He knew what he’d want to wear: the one colorful sweater with a damaged look he had found recently at a vintage store. But come Sunday and after long consideration, Hokuto opted for a classic (though boring) style he usually wore for work, too, when he didn't want to stand out too much. Denim, black, white, nothing too loud or eccentric.</p><p>Despite the small outfit crisis, Hokuto was a bit early at the station. While waiting, he wondered about their café options, which weren’t great. There was a small, boring chain café by the opposite exit and another one at a mall nearby, and that was about it. The suburban problems.</p><p>Hokuto was just digging out his phone to check about other options, when a car right in front of the station honked, making him jump a little. Hokuto glanced up just in time to see the window rolling down and Shintaro looking out.</p><p>“Hi!” Shintaro greeted cheerfully.</p><p>“Hi,” Hokuto answered and walked up to the car, a bit dumbfounded. “Eh, you have a car?”</p><p>“Yep,” Shintaro smiled. “I thought I could drive us to this nice café my friend owns. It’s a bit farther so the car is faster than the train. If… that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“Oh. Y-yeah. Sure! That sounds good.”</p><p>Hokuto rounded the car and sat down in the front seat next to Shintaro. He was still quite surprised by the turn of events, but he had to admit this was a lot better than grabbing coffee from the café by the station.</p><p>He watched as Shintaro veered the car out of the station area, and thought to himself that someone driving shouldn’t have been as attractive as it was to him. Shintaro adjusted the radio volume and input the café’s address to the navigator.</p><p>“Sorry that it took some time to arrange this,” he then said. “The past week was pretty crazy, both work and family wise. Had some major deadlines at work and Chiyo had a small flu so she couldn’t be in the daycare...”</p><p>“Oh! Is she better already?”</p><p>“Yeah, luckily. She’s at my parents’ now for the weekend, so it’s rare free time for me.” Shintaro grinned while glancing at Hokuto.</p><p>Hokuto hesitated some seconds before asking the question he’d been wondering about the most.</p><p>”So… it’s just you and her? If you don’t mind me asking?”</p><p>“No, not at all,” Shintaro said right away, sounding easy-going. “But yep, just me and her.”</p><p>Hokuto nodded slowly, suddenly unsure how to react or what to say. It was like he’d somewhat expected, but now he wasn’t sure how it made him feel. Dozens of new questions also popped into his mind. Shintaro seemed to interpret his silence correctly as he let out a short laugh.</p><p>“There’s nothing dramatic though. I had this friends-with-benefits thing with a girl back in university. We were careful, but somehow she got pregnant anyway. Well, we discussed it and decided to have the baby, but right before it was born, she felt that she wasn’t ready for it after all and was already thinking of giving the baby up for adoption. I did want it though, I had always wanted kids so I thought why not now. So it’s been just me and Chiyo from the start! Well, my family and especially mum has helped a lot along the way...”</p><p>“Wow…” Hokuto muttered, impressed and amazed. He thought of himself back in university and tried imagining that fellow with a newborn baby. It was impossible. “It must’ve been tough! All alone.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Shintaro shrugged. “It’s still tough, but that’s parenting for you. But it’s all worth it in the end.”</p><p>Shintaro’s smile was soft and Hokuto answered it, nodding silently, though of course he couldn’t even start imagining the hardships or joys of parenting. But he thought of Chiyo in the swings, giggling gleefully at him, and maybe he got it even a little bit.</p><p>“But enough about me! Or us. What about you?” Shintaro then asked. “What do you do? How did you end up in the same sleepy neighborhood?”</p><p>Hokuto chuckled. He wasn’t good at this, talking about himself, but Shintaro had just told about such personal stuff so he supposed he’d have to step up, too. He took a deep breath before answering.</p><p>“Well, I live there since the rent is quite cheap. And I’m an actor. Or that’s what I do most of the time.”</p><p>“What? Really?”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“You mean, you’ve been on TV and stuff?”</p><p>“Well, only in very small roles so far...”</p><p>“But that’s so cool!” Shintaro looked at him with widened eyes and an impressed look on his face. “You gotta tell me the dramas, I’ll check them out!”</p><p>“Alright,” Hokuto promised, smiling to himself. He hadn’t expected such an enthusiastic response, but it seemed that Shintaro liked watching dramas and movies. He proceeded on asking which productions Hokuto had been on and which celebrities he possibly knew (“You’re friends with <i>Kikuchi Fuma</i>? That’s nuts!”) and whether he could tell any backstage gossip.</p><p>Hokuto found it surprisingly easy to talk with Shintaro, with him being so easygoing, frank and sincere. He was genuinely interested in Hokuto’s job, and was impressed with his roles, though Hokuto himself didn’t really find his countless times as an extra or a minor background character that special. But Shintaro’s excited reaction warmed his heart anyway.</p><p>They chatted pleasantly all the way to the café, which turned out to be somewhere on the back alleys of Kichijoji. Shintaro parked the car and they walked the rest of the way to a small, fancy looking place with concrete floor, chipboard counter and walls full of colorful posters and flyers. The guy behind the counter was as colorful as the interior; a blue cap, bright orange T-shirt and neon colored accessories was a combination that amazed even Hokuto. The guy seemed to know Shintaro, as he exclaimed happily the moment they stepped in.</p><p>“Heey! Long time no see! Where have you been?”</p><p>“Oh, you know,” Shintaro sighed and leaned against the counter. “Juggling work and family.”</p><p>“Hmm, I get that. But nice to see you!”</p><p>“Likewise,” Shintaro smiled and then turned to Hokuto, introducing them. “This is Jesse. And this is Matsumura Hokuto. We live close by.”</p><p>Hokuto bowed at Jesse quickly, while Jesse’s eyebrows jumped comically and a wide grin spread on his face.</p><p>“Oh! Are you guys... you know...” He pointed a finger between Shintaro and Hokuto, grinning widely, and suddenly Hokuto felt his face growing hot.</p><p>“What? No, no!” Shintaro denied quickly, letting out a laugh that sounded a bit strained to Hokuto. He noticed Shintaro’s ear turning red. “Like I said, we live in the same area. He’s helped out with Chiyo a couple of times.”</p><p>“Alright, alright, just teasing a bit!” Jesse said, all chipper, and handed Hokuto the menu. “What can I get you?”</p><p>Hokuto scanned the menu card and panicked at the long list of different sorts of coffees and teas. In the end he just went with a basic cappuccino.</p><p>“I’ll get that for you, you can go and take a seat,” Shintaro told him and Hokuto thankfully hurried to a vacant table by the back wall. He sat down, still feeling a bit awkward after Jesse’s sudden suggestion at the counter. And sure, of course Shintaro would deny it, but it still stung somewhat. Hokuto looked at the counter and saw Shintaro chatting cheerfully with Jesse while the barista made their drinks. Hokuto had yet more questions in his mind.</p><p>After a moment, Shintaro walked to the table with their coffees, sitting down opposite Hokuto.</p><p>“Sorry about Jesse,” he apologized immediately in a low voice. “He has a weird sense of humor, and he’s half American, so sometimes there’s no filter whatsoever…”</p><p>Shintaro looked sincerely apologetic, and even a bit uneasy, so Hokuto gave him his best reassuring smile.</p><p>“No worries,” he convinced and took a sip of his coffee. He couldn’t help adding jokingly: “So do you usually bring all your dates to this café?”</p><p>Shintaro laughed heartily at that. “What dates? Haven’t really had any in years. That’s what single parenting does to you.”</p><p>Hokuto hummed at that. Understandable, he supposed. His small joke had managed to lighten the atmosphere again, and they fell easily back to their earlier conversation. All in all, it was a pleasant not-date. The coffee was good, and Hokuto enjoyed himself and Shintaro’s company.</p><p>He wouldn’t lie, he’d have liked it if it <i>had</i> been a date, but he supposed he’d just have to settle for being Shintaro’s friendly neighbor. Or maybe even a friend?</p><p>That would be good too, Hokuto thought when they were driving back from the café. Maybe his crush would fade away in time, like they usually did. He leaned languidly back in the seat, listening to Shintaro’s long story about a time Jesse had watched Chiyo for half a day, barely managing. Hokuto listened to Shintaro’s laughter and kept glancing at his handsome side profile or his hands on the steering wheel. It <i>would</i> fade...</p><p>Before dropping him off, when Shintaro suggested they should do this again some time, Hokuto happily agreed.</p><p>“And if you ever need help with Chiyo, like someone to watch over her, you can call me,” he said. “I think I could manage with her.”</p><p>“You definitely could,” Shintaro agreed. “Much better than Jesse, I’m sure. Thanks!”</p><p>After one last smile and a wave, Shintaro drove off, and Hokuto was left alone with his overthinking mind and pining heart.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Random note but when imagining Shintaro and Chiyo's home, I pictured the Yagami family's flat from Digimon Adventure for some reason. XD <a href="https://reliablejoukido.tumblr.com/post/181203948612/digimon-home-decor-series-the-yagami-residences" rel="nofollow">So something like this</a>, if you want the same mental image as me haha.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On occasion, Hokuto met up with some of his actor colleagues for lunch or dinner when their schedules allowed. It had been a while, but now they’d finally managed to agree on a lunch meeting again. Mone and Fuma were both busier than he was, <i>real actors</i> in Hokuto’s opinion, and it was always nice to share work related thoughts and worries with them. This time they spent the first half of lunch catching up, talking about their latest productions and upcoming projects.</p><p>Fuma and Mone were supposed to appear on a same variety show soon, and as they got engrossed in discussing that, Hokuto quickly checked his phone which had been vibrating on the table a couple of times.</p><p>He found a string of messages from Shintaro. They’d been chatting quite frequently after the coffee outing, which Hokuto was glad about. It was all friendly and casual, like it was supposed to be, but Hokuto still let himself enjoy the delight he felt when reading Shintaro’s messages or seeing the selfies of him and Chiyo he sometimes sent, too. They cheered him up.</p><p>This time was no different. Shintaro had sent a picture of an Elsa doll he’d found in his laptop case. <i>My assistant for today?</i></p><p>Hokuto was just typing out an answer, when Mone’s voice interrupted him.</p><p>“Who are you texting?” she asked, peering at Hokuto curiously.</p><p>“Uhh, just a friend,” Hokuto answered quickly, putting down his phone. He tried to look nonchalant but could feel his cheeks growing hot under Mone’s weirdly knowing look.</p><p>And indeed, also Fuma raised his brows and he and Mone exchanged meaningful glances.</p><p>“Do you smile so lovingly at all your friends' texts?” Fuma wanted to know. Mone nudged him with her elbow.</p><p>Hokuto sighed and felt like shrinking before the two. “It’s Shintaro,” he finally admitted, talking mostly to Mone.</p><p>“Oh! That hot neighbor of yours? You’re texting now?!”</p><p>“Wait, what’s this?” Fuma inquired immediately. Mone summarized the situation to Fuma based on the brief summary Hokuto had given her earlier. When Hokuto now listened to the report himself, it sadly sounded much ado about nothing.</p><p>Fuma and Mone seemed interested, though.</p><p>“You like this guy?” Fuma asked in his straight-forward manner. “You should hook up with him!”</p><p>“Thanks, great advice, Fuma,” Hokuto retorted dryly.</p><p>Fuma spread his hands like it really was great advice in his opinion, while Mone asked gently: “You’d want something more than just a hookup?”</p><p>Hokuto just shrugged, trying to downplay his feelings for the others, as well as himself. “I don’t even know him that well yet. And I don’t know if he’s into guys at all… I mean, he’s dated girls before so it’s not looking great. But I’d want to be his friend nonetheless.”</p><p>“I get that,” Mone said sympathetically, squeezing Hokuto’s arm. “So be his friend, get to know each other more. You never know what’s going to happen!”</p><p>Hokuto smiled at her, grateful for her kind words.</p><p>“Yeah, I hear quite many guys are bi-curious nowadays, so you never know,” Fuma mused meanwhile, sipping his coffee.</p><p>“Anyway, happy pining!”</p><p>–</p><p>On the same evening, while Hokuto was on his way home after grabbing dinner from the nearby convenience store, there was a new message from Shintaro.</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b><br/>
<i>Heyy bit of an emergency here!<br/>
What are you doing tomorrow?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b><br/>
<i>Nothing much. Why?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Shintaro:</b><br/>
<i>Could you watch Chiyo for a couple of hours? 🙏 I have a sudden meeting at the office…</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b><br/>
<i>Of course! When and where?</i>
</p><p> </p><p>The next day around noon, Hokuto rang Shintaro’s door bell, feeling both nervous and excited. He had promised to help with Chiyo if needed and had really meant it, he’d just never thought the opportunity would present itself so quickly. And Hokuto had zero babysitting experience, so he really wished he could somehow just wing it.</p><p>“Hi! Welcome,” Shintaro greeted cheerfully when opening the door and letting Hokuto in.</p><p>He was a bit taken aback by Shintaro’s appearance; so far Hokuto had only seen him in very casual clothing like shorts and jeans, but now he was clearly dressed for work. He wore dark slacks, white dress shirt and a tie and that style, while foreign to Hokuto’s eye, looked as good on him as anything else.</p><p>“Thank you so much for this, really!” Shintaro said when they walked further in. “I’ll be in your debt again. You can think how I can repay this time.”</p><p>“No need for that,” Hokuto chuckled. “I’m happy to help.”</p><p>Shintaro didn’t look convinced. “Well, we can discuss that later. Anyway, welcome to our place!”</p><p>Hokuto looked around. The apartment looked modern yet cozy. The short hallway from the foyer led to a combined kitchen and living room area. Big windows on the back wall showed a spacious balcony. On his right Hokuto saw two doors, one of which was open, revealing part of a room that was clearly Chiyo’s: bright colors and toys scattered around.</p><p>“Make yourself at home,” Shintaro urged. “And try to pass the time while I’m away. You can play with her, or maybe watch a movie, if she wants. She usually sleeps about an hour before dinner. If not, she gets cranky later, so I do recommend the nap. You can read a book to her and she should pass out pretty easily. And there’s food in the fridge, for both of you. You just need to cook the rice. Hmm, what else? You can message me if anything comes up, I’ll try to answer as soon as I can.”</p><p>“Thanks, I think we’ll manage,” Hokuto assured, while trying to make a mental note about everything Shintaro had told him.</p><p>“And just be strict with her if needed,” Shintaro said. “She can be a bit defiant and cranky at times, especially if she’s tired or hungry.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Right then, like summoned, Chiyo peeked out from her room. Hokuto smiled and waved at her while Shintaro walked up to her, crouching next to the door.</p><p>“Chiyo, papa will go to work now. Hokuto will be here with you. Be nice like we agreed, okay?”</p><p>The girl stared at Hokuto and then leaned towards Shintaro, whispering something to him shyly.</p><p>“Yeah, you can watch Frozen, if you want,” Shintaro answered her question out loud, glancing at Hokuto with a grin. “You like that movie, don’t you, Hokuto?”</p><p>“Oh, I love it,” Hokuto said right away, smiling encouragingly at Chiyo.</p><p>“Great. I have to go now. Be a good girl, Chiyo,” Shintaro said, pecking his daughter’s cheek and ruffling her hair before standing up again. He picked up a suit jacket from a kitchen chair, putting it on and grabbing a laptop case from the kitchen counter.</p><p>“Like I said, message if there’s anything at all…”</p><p>“I shall, but no worries,” Hokuto reassured. “Go to your meeting. We’ll manage!”</p><p>Shintaro gave him the warmest smile and a sudden squeeze on the shoulder, making Hokuto’s stomach jump a little.</p><p>“Thanks, really. I’ll see you later.” Shintaro marched to the foyer, putting on his shoes and turning to wave to Chiyo one last time. “Bye bye, Chiyo!”</p><p>“Bye, papa,” Chiyo waved back.</p><p>Shintaro closed the door, and Hokuto let out the breath he had been holding for some reason. He then turned to look at the little girl who stood by the living room. She glanced at Hokuto, still seeming a bit shy.</p><p>Hokuto crouched down to Chiyo’s level like Shintaro had done. “Well, Chiyo-chan, what shall we do? Do you want to watch Frozen?”</p><p>Turned out that she really did. Though she had concentration only for the first 20 minutes or so, before her toys started being more interesting. She brought Hokuto the Anna doll and kept Else herself, watching the Let it go scene intently with it. After that, she started playing something that Hokuto had a hard time following, but he kept Anna close by in case she would be needed.</p><p>Shintaro sent him a couple of texts of things he had forgotten to mention, like where Hokuto could find diapers, how the rice cooker worked, what to do if she refused to eat and so on. Hokuto sent him many random stickers, repeating again how they would be fine.</p><p>While Hokuto was writing, Chiyo walked up to him and nudged his knee. “No phone!” She ordered, making Hokuto smile.</p><p>“Sorry! I was answering to papa. Hey, do you want to take a picture and send it to him?”</p><p>“Yes!” The girl got excited, jumping up and down. Hokuto sat down on the floor beside Chiyo, raising his phone for a selfie. They both smiled and made peace signs for the camera.</p><p>The concept of a selfie was clearly familiar to Chiyo; she knew how to pose, and after Hokuto had taken a few pictures, she immediately leaned closer to see them.</p><p>“Look, they’re very cute!” Hokuto said as he showed her the photos. Chiyo leaned against his shoulder and giggled happily. Hokuto felt his heart melting, the sound was probably the most adorable thing he’d ever heard.</p><p>He was totally captivated by the small girl. And her father. Shintaro answered their selfie with a heart and sent back a photo of himself making a bored face at an office. Hokuto wanted to answer with a heart as well but chose a fighting type sticker instead.</p><p>After the pictures, Chiyo was much more familiar with Hokuto, the earlier shyness all gone. He had mentally braced himself for tantrums or other challenges, remembering what Shintaro had said, but the day was surprisingly smooth sailing altogether. Chiyo played nicely by herself, went to bed when Hokuto suggested a nap and indeed fell asleep quickly while he sat by the bed, reading a Moomin book to her.</p><p>While she slept, Hokuto tidied the toys from the living room and prepared the food. Chiyo woke up by herself before the hour was up and padded quietly to the kitchen while Hokuto was setting up the table.</p><p>”Morning!” he greeted, petting her head gently. ”Are you hungry?”</p><p>The girl nodded and climbed on a chair on her own. She had cute practice chopsticks, but Hokuto had also prepared a spoon and fork for her since he didn’t know which she’d want to use. He also made sure to cut the hamburger steak Shintaro had prepared into small enough pieces. Chiyo ate with a good appetite, even the cucumbers and carrots. She behaved so well it was almost weird, and said a proper and very adorable thank you after the meal.</p><p>When she was done with dinner, Chiyo disappeared to her room and Hokuto quickly finished his food and cleaned up the table. Then, he dropped down on the couch, letting out a small sigh. He wondered if he could quickly check his phone while Chiyo was playing on her own…</p><p>As soon as the thought occurred, the girl trotted back and climbed beside Hokuto on the couch. She was holding a pile of books in her hands, looking expectant.</p><p>“Shall we read something?” Hokuto suggested, and Chiyo nodded promptly. She made herself comfortable beside Hokuto and chose a Peppa Pig book from her pile. Hokuto took it and read the name out loud. He noted that Chiyo’s attention was already keenly on the book in his hands, and suddenly Hokuto felt weird pressure to read the book well enough for her.</p><p>He wasn’t that familiar with Peppa Pig but he tried his best at guessing how each character could sound. He made his voice gruff for the father, higher for the mother and high-pitched and squeaky for the kids. Chiyo seemed to enjoy his arrangement, especially the gruff voiced father pig. She wanted to hear the father pig’s lines at least three times before they could move on.</p><p>Hokuto was so into reading and acting out the characters, laughing with Chiyo, that he didn’t hear the front door at first. Only when Shintaro called “I’m home!”, they noticed his return. Chiyo greeted her father happily, and Shintaro walked straight to the living room, discarding his jacket and case on the way. His tie was gone and he had rolled up his shirt sleeves.</p><p>“Hi! How have you been?” He walked to the couch and sat down by Chiyo, accepting an immediate hug from her. “Have you been nice to Hokuto?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Shintaro grinned at him over Chiyo’s head, raising a brow like asking if that was true.</p><p>“She has,” Hokuto smiled. “We’ve had a nice time, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Chiyo chirped cheerfully. “We watched Frozen and played and Hokuto read me a book.”</p><p>“Yes, I heard that,” Shintaro said, smiling, stroking Chiyo’s hair. “Hokuto reads better than papa, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, he did funny voices,” Chiyo agreed, and Hokuto raised his hands on his cheeks, feeling a bit embarrassed that Shintaro had heard his silly versions of Peppa Pig characters. He kind of wished the couch would just swallow him.</p><p>“As expected of an actor,” Shintaro grinned.</p><p>Done with the greetings, Chiyo quickly jumped down from the couch and hurried back to her room. Hokuto, trying to shake off his embarrassment, shut the book that was still on his lap, putting it aside.</p><p>“So no tantrums or anything at all?” Shintaro confirmed in a low voice, sounding surprised.</p><p>“Nope,” Hokuto said. “I was mentally prepared, but she was so well-behaved the whole day.”</p><p>“Wow. Okay then, would you be ready to give up your job as an actor and be her permanent babysitter instead?” Shintaro then asked. ”You’re clearly a natural with her.” He had turned towards Hokuto, resting his arm on the back of the couch. Now that Chiyo wasn’t between them anymore, he was sitting surprisingly close.</p><p>“Depends how much you’d pay,” Hokuto answered, playing along.</p><p>”Oh, I’d give you a good offer for sure,” Shintaro promised right away, his smile playful and warm and <i>wow</i> it made Hokuto’s stomach do flips again. As did his next words:</p><p>“Anything to keep you.”</p><p>”Then I’ll consider.”</p><p>His heart drumming in his ears, Hokuto turned slightly towards Shintaro, who was still watching him. His gaze was somewhat piercing and unreadable. The mood had suddenly shifted into something heavy and charged, and Hokuto felt his skin tingle. Were they… flirting? Hokuto was definitely toying on the edge, but what about Shintaro? He was very aware of Shintaro’s closeness and his hand on the couch back, close to Hokuto’s neck and face. He wanted to simultaneously lean closer and pull back.</p><p>Hokuto shifted ever so slightly, his eyes dropping to Shintaro’s lips, all other thoughts momentarily fading away. He saw Shintaro’s hand moving, the fingertips brushing against his skin already, when Chiyo ran laughing back to the living room and straight to the couch, startling them both. Shintaro’s hand was gone in a second, as was the moment.</p><p>Hokuto made way for the girl, pulling back a bit while Shintaro let Chiyo climb on his lap. The girl was babbling something about her toys, and Shintaro listened patiently, chuckling a bit. Meanwhile, Hokuto busied himself with collecting the books they’d been reading earlier to a neat pile on the living room table. He felt awkward suddenly, not wanting to look at Shintaro.</p><p>“I–I think I’ll go home now,” Hokuto said once Chiyo had quieted down, and sprang up on his feet.</p><p>“Oh, okay.” There was a hint of surprise in Shintaro’s voice. “You’re welcome to stay still, I was just thinking of making some tea…?”</p><p>“No, I really gotta go. I–I have an early morning tomorrow.”</p><p>Hokuto hurried to grab his bag he’d left by the kitchen counter. He spared a quick glance towards Shintaro, who’d got up as well, holding Chiyo in his arms. They walked to the foyer in Hokuto’s tow, waiting while he put on his shoes.</p><p>“Bye bye, oniisan,” Chiyo wished cutely, pulling at Hokuto’s heartstrings yet again. As did her father with his stupidly handsome face and lovely smile, that now looked a bit subdued and more reserved than before. Hokuto felt bad, he really did, but he needed to retreat for now. His mind was still full of Shintaro’s earlier gaze and closeness and he needed some distance.</p><p>“Bye, Chiyo,” he smiled and ruffled her hair. “I’ll come again.”</p><p>“Thank you for today, really,” Shintaro said. “You saved us.”</p><p>Hokuto waved his thanks away. “It’s nothing. I’m happy to help! Well… See you.”</p><p>Opening the door, he waved at Chiyo and gave Shintaro one quick glance, an awful stiff smile on his face.</p><p>“Yeah, see you. Good night!”</p><p>–</p><p>On top of awful, Hokuto felt kind of hot and bothered the whole way home, so when he reached his flat, he decided to text Mone. He needed to vent to <i>someone</i>, and he hoped she would be more understanding than Fuma.</p><p>Turned out he was wrong. After he’d hastily recounted the situation:</p><p>
<b>Mone:</b><br/>
<i>Wait what?? So did something actually happen between you two?</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b><br/>
<i>No but if Chiyo hadn’t come I would’ve probably kissed him…</i>
</p><p>
<b>Mone:</b><br/>
<i>.....<br/>
What happened to just being friends at first?<br/>
Seems like you took Fuma’s advice instead of mine</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b><br/>
<i>NO 😭😭<br/>
I don’t know what happened…<br/>
What should I do?</i>
</p><p>
<b>Mone:</b><br/>
<i>Well sounds like you should talk with him<br/>
And not run away</i>
</p><p>
<b>You:</b><br/>
<i>☹️<br/>
Thought you’d say that…</i>
</p><p>
<b>Mone:</b><br/>
<i>But think about the bright side: seems like he may be bi-curious after all!</i>
