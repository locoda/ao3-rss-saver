    <div class="userstuff">
      <p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p2" align="justify">
  <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify"><strong><span class="s1">         H</span></strong>okuto let it go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He let Taiga transfer to the Narcotics Department. That was unfair of him to hold onto him, and forcing him to do it his way instead of letting Taiga make his own choices, whether he deemed it as erroneous or not.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga was an adult who could make his own choices.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">So Taiga got quickly transferred as soon as Hokuto signed it off. Taiga became a great help in the department given his past knowledge and most of all, his energy. He was so eager to prove himself and improve the department’s status that he also brought the team together. His quick wit helped him and his colleagues more than once during difficult cases. Taiga was definitely cut for that job, and everyone knew that. Hokuto knew too. So letting him join another department, letting him thrive was the best gift he could give to the one he so dearly loved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Even if he had to let him go.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">In a couple of years, Taiga became the head of the department — mainly because the former chief was retiring and decided to give his position to Taiga that still possessed that energy and youth to handle such a difficult job.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">During those two years, Taiga and Hokuto didn’t talk to each other. Of course, Hokuto had this farewell sex which still haunted him until this day and sometimes craved for more but Taiga’s ambition was the priority and he wouldn’t get in his way any longer ; not when he had wasted half of Taiga’s life out of lust and carelessness. He couldn’t let his selfishness take over, those times were over.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He didn’t expect Taiga to become a monk either, he had guessed he was seeing people but he absolutely didn’t expect Taiga to go back to Fuma again and he had to find out in the worst way possible — That was during a Police Gala that was being held every February around Valentine’s Day. It was a coincidence, but everyone could bring anyone they wanted. Taiga had to bring Fuma at his arm.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">All of their colleagues were surprised, not many of them were out of the closet and it stunned Hokuto how fearless Taiga could be. He was now the Chief Inspector anyway, why would he care about what his underlings had to say? Wasn’t his experience a valuable one for their work as well? Eerily, Taiga made sure that everyone knew, everyone had to accept it for the better and the worse.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">The Force was a strength to the people and not a bully to them.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">At this moment, Hokuto fell even more for Taiga.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Fuma, though, who is a known criminal in the circle was not very liked in a Police Gala. Actually, everyone wondered why Taiga had to bring him out of all men on Earth. He introduced Fuma as a close informant of his. Fuma got exempted of jail time in exchange of good intel. He provided lots of insights about the streets, but Taiga had to protect him from being killed every other day. Fuma didn’t leave Taiga’s side once ever since he ratted out on a lot. Taiga and Fuma had an agreement with Juri: Fuma was ratting out only on the dirty ones who bothered Juri’s managing style. He had to make choices, and instead of killing, he’d rather throw them in jail. Even if it meant that he might have to deal with them later on.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">All that time spent together, Taiga couldn’t help but being drawn by Fuma’s playfulness<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and suddenly they were sleeping again and again and again, reluctance long forgotten. Taiga had to admit it: Fuma could be very good in bed. Ever since he discovered gay sex, Fuma had literally seen a world opening up to him and always found new things to try with Taiga, which delighted him.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga had a lot of work in general, so he liked to be pampered by Fuma who became the one who took care of him, going to the supermarket, cleaning his apartment (where he crashed everyday)… They became an established couple without any warning.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">That warning, Hokuto didn’t get it, especially not when Taiga and Fuma started to dance together in the middle of the ballroom, the crowd had lessened because the night had run its course, raising enough money to fund new equipment that the Government couldn’t provide. Money that meant nothing to Hokuto right now as he watched Taiga and Fuma dance slowly, with a flute of champagne each in their hands. Taiga and Fuma left their jackets somewhere, feeling too constricted and too hot in it. Fuma loosened his tie but Taiga also left it with his jacket, unbuttoning the first buttons of his white shirt. They seemed to be used to each other’s bodies, Fuma closed his eyes while smelling Taiga’s hair. He was the one who bought his shampoo, but Hokuto didn’t know that, he just hated the sight, hated to see Taiga’s hand so low on Fuma’s back, fingers so close to slide under his pants.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga had dyed his hair black ever since he became a Chief Inspector, not because he wanted respect, but because his roots were dying and he was mainly stuck at the office. He wasn’t on the field as much as he wanted to and needed a change from his past. Taiga with black hair looked like another person, he looked less rebellious, much more serious and perhaps, sultrier in Hokuto’s eyes. It contrasted with his diaphanous skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flushed skin that was glistening under the lights of the room, collarbones and chest peeking through his shirt.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As Taiga moved against Fuma on one of those slow paced songs on which you could make babies, Hokuto felt the pit of his stomach burning uncomfortably.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">To be honest, he was fine when he didn’t have to witness it.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">To see them together, dancing so suavely together, fueling on champagne and sweat infuriated him. Hokuto wished his feelings had withered over time. It didn’t. Hokuto didn’t understand why it just didn’t.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Hokuto couldn’t forget. Even when he was with Shintaro, Taiga always remained in a little corner inside his head and heart. He couldn’t suppress it no matter what he did, he couldn’t suppress that feeling that was rushing to his head as he saw Taiga almost shaking in desire in Fuma’s arms in front of everyone. What was he thinking? They were still <em>police officers</em>.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Hokuto didn’t think once when he walked up to them. Taiga’s hooded lids laid on Hokuto’s figure, a small smile on his lips, mocking him and everyone on Earth.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“What do you want?” Taiga immediately asked, knowing that Hokuto came with conflict in his hands.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">His eyebrow raised and just stared at them. He came with no definite plan but to wreck this sight.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You—…” Fuma’s eyes widened at Hokuto’s straightforward words. “You stop that, you’re surrounded by colleagues. That’s inappropriate.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Are you jealous?” Taiga chuckled. “But I’m not yours.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“This isn’t the point.” He has never belonged to anyone, Hokuto thought, not even Fuma who unconsciously backed away, even if Taiga had his hand clasped around his arm to force him to stay and not run away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“It’s not?” Taiga pretended shock and surprise. He was good at sassy comebacks and Hokuto hated him right now. “Are you sure?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Whatever.” Hokuto said as he stepped back. He had to get out of here before they got into another argument. They were already known as the worst rivals of the PD, Hokuto didn’t want to add more fuel to the fire. Albeit, Taiga didn’t need any.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">As Hokuto walked away, Fuma patted Taiga’s head.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You are really a cunning asshole to him.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga turned towards Fuma, chuckling. “Yeah, I just want him to explode. It’s the first move he made in two years, I wanted to know if he was still into me. He seems he never really let it go.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“And now that you know, what will you do?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I guess I’ll end up falling again and giving us another chance.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Fuma nodded, understanding.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><hr/><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga had never been to Hokuto’s place. He wasn’t allowed to take a peak on the other officers’ personal files, but it was Taiga, he always finds what he wants. He might have asked Yugo who, before answering, asked why. Taiga had pouted when Yugo asked, not wanting to tell him but it was unfair to Yugo who was also quite protective of Hokuto.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Why do you want to know?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I realized he didn’t let go.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“He never will. But you did, didn’t you?” Yugo asked.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I am getting confused. I was so sure of my choice but now that I am where I’ve always wanted to be. Maybe it’s time.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“You’re torturing him, Taiga.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Don’t you think he’d be happy if I knock on his door?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“False hope will just kill him a bit more.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“There’s no false hope, here. Just hope.” Taiga assured him.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Yugo deeply sighed over the phone and Taiga could hear Juri’s small voice asking him if everything was okay. He could hear a rustle, perhaps a hand that reached Juri to tell him that everything was okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Kochi, please.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“A’ight. I’m trusting your choices here. I’ll text you his address.” Yugo finally agreeing. “How about Fuma? You brought him to the gala, you’re the talk of the town. The officers are all gossiping on the server.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“He knows what he got into.” Taiga just said before adding: “I’ll restrict the access to that freaking server if you guys keep using it for personal purposes.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Don’t be a party pooper, Taiga. Now that you’re chief, you should cut them some slack. They really appreciate you for setting up that server. There’s better communication between the teams.” Yugo said.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“More to snitch on us to Juri, you mean?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Okay, good night, Taiga.” Yugo immediately cut the conversation short.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><hr/><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga wasn’t someone to overthink his every action and yet when he arrived in front of Hokuto’s building, he considered going back home. It wasn’t a good idea to mess with him again but Hokuto’s reaction at the gala made Taiga hope that they still had a chance.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">One last chance.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He thought as he knocked on Hokuto’s door.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Hokuto didn’t answer.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">If he didn’t, then Taiga would not insist. It was perhaps destiny that didn’t want them to find each other.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He knocked one last time for one last chance, the door still remained shut.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Can’t you just open a door for me?” Taiga whispered.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">It seems that his prayer worked because the door suddenly opened.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Hey.”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“What are you doing here? Did something happen? Is it Yugo?” Taiga shook his head so softly, smiling at Hokuto’s sudden worried expression. “Are you okay?” Hokuto asked again, certain that Taiga’s appearance at his threshold meant that something grave happened.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Nothing happened.” Taiga just so simply said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Are you mad at my behavior at the Gala?” Hokuto then inquired.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Taiga was annoyed. Because he thought that, he, too, would forget all about this past relationship with Hokuto, that they were done and over. But as soon as he saw Hokuto walk towards them, his heart skipped a beat, just like a teenager. He never thought that he would still feel anything towards him. Perhaps it was because he looked stunning in his navy blue suit, perhaps it was that very little hint of jealousy that Hokuto couldn’t hide no matter how much he tried to.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">After so many years, if they both still felt so much, maybe… Taiga could finally let him back in?</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“I just wanted to ask you if you could give me another chance?”</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">Widening his eyes, Hokuto let the most relieved sigh Taiga had ever heard. It sounded like a dream, to Hokuto. He had dreamt of that day every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">He smiled shyly as he took Taiga’s hands in his to make him step inside his home.</p><p class="p2" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify">“Of course…” Hokuto said. “Of course.”</p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p><p class="p1" align="justify"> </p>
