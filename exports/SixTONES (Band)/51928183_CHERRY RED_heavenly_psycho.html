<br/>
</p><p align="justify">He lured him in.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">With his beautiful looks, with his wide shiny pupils that promised love, happiness and innocence... Jesse got utterly deceived. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Eventually, he realized he was falling for the devil, and that the sweet smile was just an enchantment. It took him a while to realize how cunning Kochi Yugo actually was. That man wasn’t an innocent one, he wasn’t even a man, he was not human at all. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was an animal who trapped you, and brainwashed you into thinking that he was weak and helpless before making you feel like he was the only existence that ever mattered.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse believed it so wholly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo was his only one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And he believed him when Yugo <em> said </em> he was his only one. He wanted to believe it. He thought he saw truth and sincerity reflected in the copper glow of his eyes. He saw love in his smile and lust in the way his body arched for him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But then, Yugo took much more than his love, he took his blood, his tears and his soul. Everything he could ever give. Jesse, as the fool as he was, gave it to him. Yugo became the only person he could ever trust in a world where everyone had betrayed him and abandoned him. Of course, he was willing to give everything he had to Yugo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nightly, when they were having sex – they always met at night, when no one was around, when no one could hear or see them and when Yugo was glowing like a sun on a dark night, – Yugo would suck him so deeply and so hard that Jesse couldn’t move anymore for hours. Jesse was a strong man though, he would always get back to his feet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tonight was the worst day ever. Yugo had ridden him like a bull. He was so particularly turned on that Yugo came on his stomach over the slightest dirty word Jesse had muttered. Jesse happily gave him his everything to his every last drop when Yugo was bouncing so filthily on top of him. Every time Yugo felt their climax run through their bodies, he would lean down to lick the pale skin and sink his teeth into the fresh flesh. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse gave himself away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He kept giving until he was feeling death welcome him with open arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was okay to die by his hands, he thought. This was what loyalty was supposed to be. But why was he loyal to him? Because he loved him? But was it enough? To love unconditionally? He loved him back, too. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Right?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey…” Jesse managed to whisper, he was so weak he knew his minutes were counted and that the angels were coming for him. “... Yugo?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo had turned around, his chin dripping with Jesse’s blood and his back dirtied by it too, he was soaking in it and he was still so high and riling on the ecstasy of the sweet love and blood that Jesse gave him that Yugo almost forgot Jesse lying down behind him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jess…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yugo, I still love you.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse was shocked he hadn’t died.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was so close to God, he almost saw the light.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But at the same moment, he felt something sour and bitter being poured into his mouth. His instincts were to drink the drops of the unknown to quench his thirst for a mysterious life. He felt so strange after feeling the liquid warm his throat and his insides. Suddenly, he was taken by a harsh fever, he felt his veins burn and his bones break one by one.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He screamed as the piercing pain was raging inside, outside, everywhere.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The process was so painful that Jesse had preferred he’d died instead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“W–Why did you save me?” Jesse’s voice was barely audible, as he caught a breath, when the pain wasn’t as excruciating as usual. The world was blurry as his eyes were constantly clouded by salty tears.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo never answered, still unable to face him, Jesse was suffering, contorting himself in pain and exhaustion in their bed where they last had made love. For Jesse it was love, for Yugo, probably it was just food.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The only answer Jesse ever had was Yugo’s hunched back, still painted in the cherry red color of his fluid. Even after days and nights of pain, Jesse still loved the sight of it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse started to be able to move once again, it felt weird to walk again. He felt like he had been resurrected. It was the eeriest feeling ever, as if his blood, his bones and his whole body were brand new. His vision had never been clearer either.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yet, Yugo still hadn’t faced him, avoiding his gaze.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Was he ashamed?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He who lured boys to take everything from them ended up saving Jesse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I still love you, you know,” Jesse had told him and Yugo had raised his eyes to meet his for the first time in weeks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know,” Yugo had said as he hid his eyes behind a soft but cold hand before pressing his lips against his. Jesse felt the strong cherry iron smell prickle his nostrils, enhancing his senses to the point he felt something explode inside of him. He didn’t know he could be even more in love as he captured Yugo’s bottom lip between his teeth, biting it by mistake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The taste was extremely strange, it wasn’t sweet, it wasn’t bitter, it… was acidic.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I love you so damn much,” Jesse repeated once again and heard Yugo whimper, holding out a choked sob.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m so <em> so </em> sorry, Jesse.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Were the last words Jesse ever heard from Yugo before he pushed him back into that bed that reminded him of both Heaven and Hell, sheets soaked in their blood, sweat and cum. Jesse could still smell all of it. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Jesse’s back hit the bed, Yugo left the room in a hurry. He was still leaving Jesse with the sight of his bloodied back.</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="justify">Jesse never saw Yugo ever again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse was left all alone with a curse that marked him for eternity.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A mark that would forever be Yugo’s.</p><p>
