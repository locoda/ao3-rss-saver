      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Reverse Trope: Really nice guy who only hits you</p><p>Here's another installment to the series! I hope y'all still enjoy reading these short fics. For this one, there's no romance. It's centered on friendship. I first posted this over at my soc med account <a href="https://x.com/geeellyaace/status/1836720436996137278" rel="nofollow">geeellyaace</a></p></blockquote>

  <span>“Yugo’s probably the nicest guy in class.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“One time, I saw Yugo accompany a freshman to their class since the girl was lost.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Being a member of the student council really suits him. He’s not only nice, his smile is also very refreshing.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <br />

</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga almost cringed in front of the girls as he overheard them talking about Yugo — the nicest guy in their class. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“If only you knew,” Taiga said in a low voice as he continued on his way.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yugo has always kept his image clean. It had been like that ever since their childhood. The Kyomotos and the Kochis have long been friends since Taiga and Yugo’s mothers were roommates in college. It was already a given that the two of them grew up together.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>No one knew Yugo better than Taiga.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr /><p align="justify">
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Aw!!!” Taiga rubbed his arm. “Could you be a little more gentle?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Could you be a little more faster in understanding this formula? We’ve been at it for an hour.” Yugo slammed down the rolled newspaper on the table. “I’ll show you again. You better pay attention.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Man, I wonder how the school would react if they find out the real you is a short tempered boy who hits his long time friend.” Taiga clicked his tongue while shaking his head.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Shut up! I would not resort to this if you weren’t so tough to teach. Besides, it was your idea that we hit each other when one makes a mistake. It’s been like that since we were kids.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Cut me some slack.” Taiga whined. “Let’s take a break.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Yugo hit his left arm with the newspaper. “One more whine and you’re gonna get hit harder.”</span>
