<em>Hanahaki disease is a rare psychosomatic disease characterized by the expectoration of flower petals. This disease is caused and precipitated by unrequited romantic feelings or significant emotional distress such as heartbreak. In this condition, a plant begins to grow inside the patient's lungs, leading to the production and expectoration of flower petals. If left untreated, Hanahaki disease can lead to severe respiratory complications and may ultimately result in the death of the patient</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p>Taiga's eyes scan the page, absorbing every word. He scrolls down.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> <strong>Symptoms:</strong> </em>
</p><ul>
<li><em><strong>Persistent Coughing:</strong> Patients frequently experience bouts of coughing, which usually worsen progressively.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hemoptysis:</strong> The expectoration of blood-tinged saliva is common as the condition advances.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dyspnea:</strong> Patients often report difficulty breathing, particularly as the floral matter accumulates in the respiratory tract.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Thoracic Pain:</strong> Chest pain, resulting from the physical presence of flowers in the respiratory system, is a notable symptom.</em></li>
<li><b><em>Throwing Up Petals: </em></b><em>Initially, patients may vomit small petals, but as the disease progresses, the plant keeps on growing within the lungs, leading to the expulsion of larger petals and entire flowers during coughing.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Psychological Distress:</strong> Patients often experience emotional and psychological burdens.</em></li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Something stings in Taiga's chest as he continues his reading.</p><p> </p><p>
<em><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>The pathogenesis of hanahaki disease involves the somatic expression of unresolved emotional distress. The florid material observed in patients is thought to originate from the body's psychosomatic response, wherein emotional pain is converted into a physical substance, in this case, flowers. This process remains largely theoretical and is a subject of ongoing research.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em><strong>Prognosis:</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>The prognosis for patients with hanahaki disease is generally poor. Without appropriate intervention, 95% of patients are either deceased or have undergone surgical removal of the floral matter within three years of onset. Those who achieve emotional resolution through reciprocated love generally experience full recovery.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em><strong>Treatment:</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>The definitive treatment for hanahaki disease involves addressing the underlying emotional distress. Reciprocated romantic feelings from the object of the patient’s affection can lead to a cure or full remission. However, it is critical for the healing that the patient genuinely believes in the authenticity of this reciprocated love. In cases where emotional resolution is unattainable, surgical intervention to remove the floral matter may be considered. This surgical intervention, while potentially life-saving, carries the significant risk of erasing all memories and feelings, leading to potential massive cognitive and emotional alterations in the patient.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There's a link to a forum. Taiga clicks on it. Scrolling down a little bit, he opens one of the threads and eyes at the messages.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I suffered from hanahaki for years, all because I couldn't believe my husband truly loved me. It wasn't until I opened up and let myself trust that love that the symptoms began to fade. It took time, but once I allowed myself to believe, the flowers stopped coming.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga leans back in his chair. He takes a deep breath.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The air hummed with the chatter of people, the clatter of utensils, and the aroma of the same food the menu had every single day. Taiga stood in line, idly tapping his foot against the tiled floor. He didn't really have any appetite. His mind was preoccupied with the upcoming rehearsal and the lines he still struggled to remember, so he barely noticed when someone sidled beside him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga first took a small tomato plate from the vitrine. Then he stopped, thought for a few more seconds, and reached out to take two more.</p><p> </p><p>"I can tell that you're not a fan of different vegetables?" a voice beside him remarked.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga raised his head. He met a pair of brown eyes looking at him under the black fringe.</p><p> </p><p>"I mean, I don't really see anything else than some tomatoes," the guy said, gesturing with his head to Taiga's tray.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, yeah," Taiga responded awkwardly and looked back at his tray, which was loaded with tomato cups. "I just... really happen to like them. Tomatoes, I mean."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, you must have the healthiest diet of all of us, then," the guy replied.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had to take a better look at the guy. Taiga remembered seeing him several times but couldn't recall the name. Taiga had to admit it immediately: the guy's face was very handsome, framed by a stylishly tousled fringe that added youthful charm to his appearance. There was an adorable mole above his upper lip that also caught Taiga's attention. His smile was a bit shy, but maybe it only reflected Taiga's own awkwardness. The guy was wearing a yellow old-school t-shirt with a funky design and a faded beige cardigan with some holes that looked funnily self-made. His pants were black and a bit worn out, rolled up at the bottom to show his ankles.  </p><p> </p><p>Taiga chuckled nervously. There was something friendly in the other guy's aura. But it had been a while since someone had initiated a conversation with him just like that, so he couldn't help being painfully aware of how awkward he himself was.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess you could say that. Tomatoes are my favorite snack," Taiga managed to mutter.</p><p> </p><p>The guy nodded. "Cool, I can only respect that. From now on, I'll make sure to give you my extra tomatoes because I don't eat them."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, always ready for that. You can count on me."</p><p> </p><p>The guy's smile was widening. "I'm Matsumura Hokuto, by the way. I think we've met before, but catching up with all the names can sometimes take work. Nice to meet you officially!"</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga. It's nice to meet you, too, Matsumura. Or meeting you again?" They bowed at each other.</p><p> </p><p>Later, Taiga was occupied with his phone settings (he should have gotten a new one already a long time ago) as he picked tomatoes into his mouth with chopsticks in his left hand. Perks of being both-handed; eating while doing something else was so much easier. He totally missed anyone standing next to him before there was a sound of a person clearing their throat.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga glanced up, his chopsticks pausing mid-air.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, would you mind if I joined you?" Matsumura Hokuto asked. "It's pretty packed everywhere else, and I don't really know people that well here."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh sure, go ahead."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took his bag from the seat next to him to make some space.</p><p> </p><p>"So, besides tomatoes, you seem to have other passions, too. I mean, are you a fan of Mr. Children, too?" Hokuto asked after sitting down, pointing at Taiga's shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiled. His favorite topic really came up that quickly with a new person.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I'm a huge fan. I've seen them live a couple of times. They're amazing."</p><p> </p><p>"No way! I've been to their concerts too. What's your favorite song by them?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'd probably lean towards <em>Eien</em> or <em>Shirushi</em>," Taiga said after pondering for a moment. It had always been challenging to choose just one favorite among so many excellent options.</p><p> </p><p>"Good choices. But they're such sad songs, so at the same time, I must say that's quite interesting. Care to enlighten me about that selection a bit more?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shrugged. "Well, I don't really gravitate towards music that directly reflects my own life," he said. "It's like how I do my acting. I'm into more universal themes and emotions, rather than specific personal experiences."</p><p> </p><p>They talked about different acting methods throughout lunch. Hokuto mentioned his desire to get maybe movie roles in the future, but it was challenging because his training had been more specialized in stage acting. For Taiga, the whole movie scene also sounded interesting. Yet, it seemed so challenging that he had been unsure about it. Many theater actors had tried and failed miserably in the film industry. Taiga wasn't willing to be one of those people. He didn't see the movie industry as inherently superior, but rather, he felt it required a different skill set that he wasn't sure he possessed. Many many actors definitely didn't have enough skills for that. Although Hokuto smiled at him politely, Taiga realized maybe too late that he was preaching all this aloud and probably sounded like he was criticizing Hokuto's goals.</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, did I sound too blunt?" Taiga stuttered and felt a bit embarrassed. "I didn't mean you wouldn't-"</p><p> </p><p>"No, no, no, that's fine. I get it," Hokuto said, and his smile didn't falter. "You're just being honest, and I appreciate that. It's tough out there, and you make a good point about it being challenging. But that's part of what makes it exciting for me."</p><p> </p><p>When they were done with their lunch and already saying goodbye, Taiga hesitated for a moment before pointing at Hokuto's phone in his hand.</p><p> </p><p>"Can I add you on LINE?" he asked, quickly realizing how forward it sounded. He hurried to correct himself, not wanting to come off as weird. "I mean, it’d probably be convenient to have contact info from someone in the same production. Since we don’t have a group chat with the others or anything."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled and waved his hand dismissively. "Ah, no worries. Of course, it's fine."</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto finally excused himself and walked away, Taiga made his way to the dish return area. With his phone in hand, he opened Hokuto's profile and kept watching the funny profile picture of the beetle. There was something oddly endearing about it, such a mundane, almost childish choice for someone who otherwise seemed so composed and mature. It made Hokuto immediately seem more human, more approachable.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clicked on Hokuto's profile picture, enlarging it to get a closer look at the beetle. A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe he had managed to make a new interesting friend.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>In the waiting room, Taiga's gaze drifts to the other people. He observes a mix of children and adults, some older, some his age. Some are accompanied by their families or loved ones, their hands intertwined in silent support, while others sit alone just as he does. Taiga can only wonder why these people accompanied by their loved ones are even there in the first place. Are they even patients?</p><p> </p><p>When he takes a look through the window, he feels as if he's trapped in a still picture.</p><p> </p><p>It feels so weird to think that people go about their days, life just keeps going on. The sun shines brightly. The proper spring is just around the corner, and the cherry blossom trees are soon in full bloom. While there's another cherry blossom tree growing in his lungs.</p><p> </p><p>When he's called by his name, his steps feel heavy as he enters the room. He sits down silently on the chair pointed at him. The room is sterile and has a distinct scent of disinfectant with white walls and bright fluorescent lights overhead. He doesn't understand why hospitals have to be like that - the surroundings have always made him feel sick even though he sometimes hasn't even been while being there.</p><p> </p><p>The doctor, a middle-aged woman with gentle eyes, studies him for a moment before starting to explain. She says she reviewed Taiga's blood test results and detailed her findings, and it's now sure that Taiga has the hanahaki disease.</p><p> </p><p>The diagnosis merely confirms what he's known all along. His body is betraying him, slowly but surely.</p><p> </p><p>The doctor watches Taiga with a gentle yet serious demeanor.</p><p> </p><p>"And I'm afraid the test results aren't deceiving us," she continues calmly. "The disease type we're dealing with is, unfortunately, malignant."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips twitch with bitter amusement.</p><p> </p><p>"Why am I not surprised," he replies dryly.</p><p> </p><p>The doctor nods in understanding, her gaze filled with compassion. She's probably trained to do it in front of the mirror, just like all the actors do. She's perhaps more interested in getting off work to go home and keeps thinking about what to cook for her children in the evening, but she must go on with the script.</p><p> </p><p>"I know this must be difficult to hear."</p><p> </p><p><em>Well, that doesn't really console me</em>, Taiga thinks to himself but doesn't say it aloud.</p><p> </p><p>"How much do I have time?" he asks bluntly instead. If he's going to die, he at least wants to know how long he can live.</p><p> </p><p>"It's hard to say," the doctor says carefully. "Hanahaki disease progresses differently for each person. But we'll do everything we can to help you."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nods, though it feels as if someone's squeezing his throat tightly. He knows the reality of his situation all too well, the plant being just a sprout now but growing each day.</p><p> </p><p>"What are my options?"</p><p> </p><p>The doctor leans forward, her expression staying sympathetic. "There are a few different treatment options we can explore. We can prescribe medication to help manage your symptoms and ease your discomfort. We can also discuss surgical interventions to remove the growing from your lungs, although that carries its own risks."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stays silent. He knows those risks all too well since he has read enough about the disease. The potential for serious complications, the high possibility of losing all memories. They say it's like wiping away the painful feelings, but no one ever talks enough about the memories holding also dearest memories. All those memories are something that his whole life is based on.</p><p> </p><p>"It's losing memories and feelings, isn't it?"</p><p> </p><p>The doctor nods but looks a bit hesitant. "Yes, that's one of the risks. But, as I said, it's important to remember that each patient is different. Some recover quite nicely after rehabilitation and are able to recall various aspects of their past. Like what used to be their favorite food or what kind of music they used to listen to. Hearing and taste senses can be more responsive to recollection than others."</p><p> </p><p>Once again, it's not really consoling.</p><p> </p><p>"Unless, of course-" the doctor continues but then pauses as she gives Taiga a look from which he can't tell what's about to come. Then he realizes it is too late since the doctor is already approaching the topic he's been trying to avoid.</p><p> </p><p>"-unless there is a way or possibility to discuss with the person who is behind your symptoms. I mean, this disease doesn't come out of nowhere. We can always book a consultant for you if you're interested-"</p><p> </p><p>"No. No, no, no. Not possible." Taiga feels the uncomfortable feeling appearing immediately. They shouldn't go there. He doesn't want to go there. Even in his thoughts, he doesn't want to go there. He's tried his best to forget, so the last thing he should do would be to bring everything back to his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily, the doctor doesn't push it further.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. Of course, we won't force it on anyone unless they want it. We can concentrate on treating the disease and the symptoms themselves."</p><p> </p><p>"Hmph."</p><p> </p><p>Then, the doctor offers Taiga another small smile as she reaches for a stack of brochures on the nearby shelf. She selects a few, and Taiga stares at the papers. Their glossy covers are full of images of smiling people.</p><p> </p><p>"These brochures contain more information about the hanahaki disease and the various treatment options available. Remember, Kyomoto, hanahaki is something you can learn to live with."</p><p> </p><p>The doctor hands Taiga a stack of brochures, and Taiga takes them without a word. His fingers tremble as he flips through them, pretending to read, even though his vision is blurred, and his mind feels blank. It's like he's forgotten how to read even the simplest characters. The bright images and upbeat titles ("<em>Me &amp; Hanahaki? It's Possible!</em>", "<em>Hope and Healing with Hanahaki</em>", "<em>Don't Let Hanahaki Define You</em>") make him feel even sicker, like he's going to throw up at any second.</p><p> </p><p>"We also have several support groups here at the hospital," the doctor continues. "Connecting with others who share your experiences can provide invaluable help during this challenging time."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, but I'm not interested," Taiga shakes his head immediately. He is not interested in other people's sob stories.</p><p> </p><p>"Your decision, of course. I'll give you the card and the information anyway. Just in case you change your mind."</p><p> </p><p>The doctor hands Taiga a card, and he takes it with a numb nod, sliding it into his pocket without looking at it. It's just... too much. The sterile smell, the muted colors of the brochures, the doctor’s kind but distant demeanor. All of that blur together, creating a surreal and almost dreamlike atmosphere. He feels like he’s floating, disconnected from everything around him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>Their sense of humor just clicked. Taiga had never thought anyone would actually find his dry, laconic jokes funny. Most people just didn't get his humor, often mistaking it for rudeness. But with Hokuto, it was different. He effortlessly caught onto Taiga's wit, laughing along with each quip, making Taiga feel understood in a way he hadn't before.</p>

<p>Hokuto showed remarkable thoughtfulness, constantly lifting spirits and offering encouragement to everyone, including Taiga, despite Taiga's singing still needing refinement in many aspects. Hokuto seized every opportunity to spread positivity, whether through grand gestures or small gestures of kindness, and Taiga couldn't help but admire that aspect of his character.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p> </p><p>"Well, some people just have a knack for it," Juri remarked one day in response after Taiga had spent a good moment going on about Hokuto's attentiveness. Taiga didn't usually talk to Juri about his colleagues at work because the cast was changing for each production, and most of the names wouldn't tell Juri anything anyway. But for some reason, he had told everything about Hokuto already.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, but Hokuto takes it to a whole other level. He's always finding ways to lift people's spirits, even when they don't realize they need it. He's so attentive. I think he's become everyone's favorite in the whole theater."</p><p> </p><p>Juri didn't comment on that but only reached out to take a control switch from the coffee table. He looked thoughtful for a moment as if debating whether to say something. Eventually, he couldn't hold it back any longer.</p><p> </p><p>"By the way, sometimes I wonder if you have a little crush on that guy."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's face fell before he could stop it. Unfortunately, Juri was also quick enough to notice that. He clicked his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>"Okayyy there," Juri said. "I was just kidding, but apparently, my words did hit somewhere-"</p><p> </p><p>"They didn't hit anywhere," Taiga muttered. He had never been the type to go so far as to confess to himself that he liked someone, let alone do something about it. So, the whole discussion was pointless.</p><p> </p><p>"So, what's the deal? He likes you too, or what?"</p><p> </p><p>That was a very good question.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga always felt a weird thrill of excitement whenever he saw a message from Hokuto on his phone. However, it was often hard to gauge whether his excitement stemmed from Hokuto's infrequent texting habits - it usually took him a while to even notice the message, let alone respond. Taiga couldn't explain it, but there was always something twisting in his stomach whenever he saw that his message had been read but a reply from Hokuto would come only hours later.</p><p> </p><p>What truly made Hokuto's messages special, though, was their length. Like he had actually used time and energy to write all that. Although they could be a bit rambling and nonsensical at times, they always felt distinctly like him. But if he sent messages like that only to Taiga? Unlikely. If he like-liked Taiga? Even more unlikely.</p><p> </p><p>"Even <em>if</em> liked him," Taiga made sure to put the emphasis on the word, "it wouldn't matter because I'm pretty sure I've understood very clearly all the hidden messages he's been showing."</p><p> </p><p>"Well, <em>if</em> I were you," Juri said. "I'd just ask him. It's not so hard."</p><p> </p><p>"There's no point in asking about anything. The last two times I've attempted to invite him somewhere, he's declined. If he wanted to spend time with me, it'd be his turn."</p><p> </p><p>"Not like you've been counting or anything," Juri commented dryly.</p><p> </p><p>"And what's that supposed to mean?" Taiga asked, feeling his face flush a little bit.</p><p> </p><p>"It means you're obviously more invested than you want to admit," Juri said. "If you're keeping track of who invites who, it's clear you care more than you're letting on."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Okay, maybe I am. But that doesn't change anything. I'm tired of putting in all the effort and getting nothing in return."</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe he's just clueless. Or maybe he's waiting for you to make a move because he's just as unsure as you are."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head. "Or maybe he just doesn't care. Either way, I'm done chasing him like an idiot."</p><p> </p><p>"Alright," Juri shrugged. "Just promise me you'll keep an open mind. Sometimes things aren't as black and white as they seem."</p><p> </p><p>Later that night in his bed, as he mulled over Juri's words, Taiga found himself replaying their interactions with Hokuto in his mind. But try as he might, Taiga couldn't shake the feeling that he was reading too much into things, grasping at straws in a desperate attempt to make sense of his own emotions.</p><p> </p><p>But then, almost like reading his mind, a message from Hokuto popped up on his phone screen, breaking through the haze of his thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> <strong>from Hokuto</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>Hey, Kyomochan!🚁🍍 I know it's last minute, but I managed to get tickets to that concert you mentioned last week🐼🎍 Would you like to go with me?🦡 Should be a blast! Let me know what you think. 😊</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart skipped a beat as he read the message. He typed out his response quickly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> <strong>to Hokuto</strong> </em>
</p><p>
<em>That sounds amazing. I'd love to go with you. Thanks for thinking of me.</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga goes two floors down to the pharmacy section.</p><p> </p><p>"Got a prescription to pick up," he says, pulling out the slip from his pocket and passing it through the window.</p><p> </p><p>When the pharmacist returns with five small bags, Taiga takes them all without a word of thanks. He can't force himself to have the energy to express gratitude, not when he feels so hollow inside. It's so weird to feel so numb at the same time when the pain inside him is throbbing.</p><p> </p><p>He wonders if he'll ever feel truly alive again. If this feeling will just last forever, until he will simply forget everything and be gone.</p><p> </p><p>Once outside, Taiga takes a deep breath, hoping the fresh air will clear his mind. But the oppressive feeling doesn't lift. He stands there for a moment, staring blankly at the world around him. People bustle by, completely unaware of the distress he holds inside.</p><p> </p><p align="center">******</p><p> </p><p>When he arrived at the park, Taiga found a nice spot. He set down a blue plastic rug and sat down on it. His guitar rested against his knees as he stared at the pink blossoms swaying gently in the breeze.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga absolutely loved spring, and interestingly, he had learned to love it more and more as he had got older.</p><p> </p><p>There was something about the fleeting beauty of the cherry blossoms, their delicate petals falling like soft pink snow. It was a bittersweet reminder of how ephemeral life could be and how precious each moment was.</p><p> </p><p>He adjusted his guitar, his fingers lightly strumming the strings. The park was quiet, with only the occasional laughter of children in the distance and the rustling of leaves in the breeze. He closed his eyes, letting the peaceful atmosphere wash over him, trying to find solace in the simplicity of the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga began to play. The way his hands and fingers moved on the guitar was gentle. As if he were pouring his delicate emotions into each chord. He sang softly.</p><p> </p><p>He had written the song a long time ago. Years ago. Now, the lyrics felt a bit distant, but he was still pretty proud of the outcome.</p><p> </p><p>Lost in his music, Taiga didn't pay attention to the people around him until a familiar voice broke through his reverie.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a beautiful song.”</p><p> </p><p>Startled, Taiga looked up to see Hokuto standing a few feet away, a soft smile on his lips. Taiga's heart skipped a beat, though he immediately realized it was a bit silly to react that way.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Taiga asked, trying to keep his voice steady.</p><p> </p><p>"They suggested someone to go and keep you company," Hokuto explained. "It'd be boring for you to spend hours here alone and keep the spot reserved for everyone."</p><p> </p><p>"And you don't find it boring? Aren't you busy with something else?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled amusedly. "My whole life is boring. I take a bath every evening and read, and literally just wait until I get back to work because I have no idea what else to do in my free time. You think such a boring un-busy person would have any right to call all this boring?" He made a gesture with his head, and Taiga must admit that the surroundings were nothing but boring.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga chuckled at that. "Oh wow, okay then. I was just a bit surprised. But welcome then to my boring un-busy company, I guess?"</p><p> </p><p>"Great, we can be un-busy and boring together."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto grinned as he settled down beside Taiga. He gestured with his head and directed his gaze towards Taiga's guitar on his feet.</p><p> </p><p>"So, you play? Guitar, I mean. I had no clue. For how long?"</p><p> </p><p>"Still practicing, to be honest. It's been a while since I started, but it's almost embarrassing to reveal how long ago it was because I probably should be much better."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, don't say it. I can't even hold any instrument properly without looking all clumsy. Can be such a burden if I'm playing the role of a musician."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiled. He knew the feeling, trying to look convincing in whatever role he was playing while trying his best to remember lines and add the right feeling to the scene. Sometimes, they had to play a character who was a whole different from their real-life selves.</p><p> </p><p>"By the way, I brought some beer. Don't worry, it's non-alcohol," Hokuto said, taking two cans out of the plastic bag and throwing the other one to Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh. Thank you," Taiga said. He opened the can and took a sip.</p><p> </p><p>"So, do you write your own songs often?" Hokuto asked, tilting his head as he watched Taiga's fingers glide over the strings. He drank from his own beer.</p><p> </p><p>"Only sometimes. It's more of a hobby than anything serious. I find it therapeutic, though. Helps me process things, you know?"</p><p> </p><p>"I get that. I've tried writing once or twice, but I always end up cringing at my own words. Guess I'm better at interpreting someone else's lines than creating my own."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga chuckled. "Yeah, but you do it so well. I remember the first time we had to do a script reading for that sad scene. You cried there! I was amazed at how you could get so deeply into the character."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto laughed, a bit embarrassed. "I cry too easily. It's almost a running joke now. If there's a sad scene, everyone just waits for me to start tearing up. It’s like a reflex."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, I didn't know it was a thing with you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I guess I get too invested," Hokuto admitted. "It's not always easy to separate myself from the character. But it's also what makes me love acting so much. To feel various emotions so deeply. And then convey those emotions to others."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded in agreement. "That's what makes you a great actor then, Hokuto. Your ability to immerse yourself in the role and bring those genuine emotions to life."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled a bit shyly, looking down at a can in his hand. "Thanks, Kyomo. That means a lot coming from you."</p><p> </p><p>There was a moment of comfortable silence as they both sipped their drinks while Taiga also kept strumming a few random chords.  </p><p> </p><p>"Do you ever think about where you'll be in a few years?" Hokuto asked all of a sudden.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had to take a good pause to consider the question. "Sometimes. I hope to keep doing what I love, you know? Acting, singing on stage. But it's hard to predict the future. What about you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, I'm not used to voicing my dreams," Hokuto said. He shrugged and looked unbothered. "But maybe I've come to realize it’s not about reaching a specific place. Maybe it’s about the journey and the growth that comes with it."</p><p> </p><p>That was very wisely worded.</p><p> </p><p>"That's a good way to look at it," Taiga said thoughtfully.</p><p> </p><p>They continued talking, sharing stories, and laughing at their shared quirks and the oddities of their lives. As the evening wore on, the park grew more bustling, the sky transitioning to deep blue with stars beginning to peek through. Eventually, a few other theater people joined them, bringing more food and drinks. The group settled in, the conversation flowing easily as they kept talking about the production and goals for the future. As always, everyone hoped to see each other again, maybe working on other productions in the future.</p><p> </p><p>When Hokuto started gathering his things, Taiga found himself blurting out, "Hey, I'll walk with you to the station."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked pleasantly surprised. "Sure, I'd like that."</p><p> </p><p>They walked in companionable silence, the cool night air crisp around them. Taiga wanted to prolong their time together. He played with an idea to suggest going to Hokuto's house or finding another way to extend the evening, but he didn't dare.</p><p> </p><p>At the station, they lingered for a moment near the gates.</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks for today," Taiga said, his voice soft.</p><p> </p><p>"Anytime. I'll see you soon, okay?" Hokuto replied.</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto went through the ticket gates, Taiga watched him until he was out of sight. Even after that, he stood there for a while.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga returns home late, he finds Juri already preparing to leave for work. Their paths briefly cross in the narrow hallway.</p><p> </p><p>They decided to move to a shared apartment five years ago, and it's been going very well, although Taiga typically returns from the last show when Juri is about to leave for his work at the bar. Tonight, though, Taiga has taken a little longer to get back, not because of his work but because he spent hours in the park after the hospital visit. He sat on the bench, staring into nothing, his head full of thoughts and, for the first time, not feeling like going home.</p><p> </p><p>"So, what did the doctor say?" Juri asks as he puts his jacket on.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shrugs. He can feel the tension in his shoulders that comes from the question. Of course, Juri wants to know.</p><p> </p><p>"Nothing much," he replies, trying his best to keep his voice neutral. "Just the usual."</p><p> </p><p>Juri arches an eyebrow, his gaze probing Taiga's face. "The usual?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nods. He reaches into his bag and pulls out a small medicine dispenser. He holds it up for Juri to see. "It's just my old asthma acting up because of being so busy and stressed recently. Got all these pills. And I need to put my old inhalator to more use, as well."</p><p> </p><p>Juri's expression softens with understanding and he seems to take in Taiga's explanation. He's already late, so luckily, he wouldn't even have time to stop on that too long.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I see. Well, I'm glad it's nothing serious."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga offers a tight smile in response. He's not good at hiding things, but he doesn't want to worry Juri. Not now.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, me too."</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Their days fell into a rhythm of rehearsals, and the theater became their second home, as it always did with a new production. </p><p> </p><p>Mornings always began with warm-ups, followed by singing sessions before lunch and choreography rehearsals later in the afternoon. Taiga found solace in these routines.  The best thing was that he was able to spend all his work days with Hokuto, that he actually had a friend with whom he could share the whole experience. Their friendship, still a bit distant, was evolving in its own unique way. Hokuto's personality seemed to have layers upon layers, fascinating Taiga in ways he couldn't quite put into words.</p><p> </p><p>During their breaks between rehearsals, Taiga often found himself chatting with only Hokuto. They would engage in different conversations, and Taiga felt a genuine connection between them, a friendship that seemed to defy their clear differences.</p><p> </p><p>Between rehearsal songs, they would glance at each other, sometimes exchanging tiny winks or mouthing the lyrics along with the music director.</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark">
<p>The only thing that sometimes bothered Taiga was that Hokuto did seem to hold some things to himself. He wasn't the type to volunteer information about certain aspects of his life unless Taiga specifically asked about them. This occasional reticence left Taiga feeling like there were parts of Hokuto's world that remained closed off, adding a layer of mystery to him. </p>

<p>One day, after another rigorous day of rehearsals, Taiga found himself staying a bit later in the theater, running through his lines one last time before calling it a night. As he gathered his belongings and prepared to leave, Mr. Yamamoto's voice rang out from across the stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Kyomoto, could I have a word with you?" the director called, beckoning Taiga over with a gesture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga frowned at the unexpected request. He glanced around, noting the curious gazes of his colleagues, before making his way towards Mr. Yamamoto.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sure, what's up?" Taiga asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. Yamamoto motioned for Taiga to follow him to his office. Once there, he beckoned him to take a seat, his expression unreadable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p> </p><p>"Before we all head home, I have something to talk about with you," Mr. Yamamoto began with a serious face. "We've been working with this casting company for a new movie project, and after negotiating this with them, they'd like to offer a significant side character role to one of our current cast." He paused for dramatic effect, then turned his look to Taiga. "Kyomoto, we'd like to offer this role to you. Your performance here has been outstanding, and we believe you'd be perfect for this part. We already suggested you to the casting company, and they showed a green light after seeing you on stage."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga felt a rush of conflicting emotions. He had always dreamed of such an opportunity, yet the timing felt off.</p><p> </p><p>His thoughts went immediately to Hokuto. They had been talking about it together and that such a movie project would be great but also challenging. And they had come to the conclusion that it'd be good to stick together. Taiga realized he had found some kind of support from Hokuto that he didn't know could exist. He could feel that Hokuto was most probably feeling exactly the same.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga forced a smile, bowing politely. "Thank you very much, Mr. Yamamoto. I'm honored by the offer."</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Yamamoto nodded, pleased. "We'll give you some time to think it over, but we hope you'll accept this. It would be a fantastic step in your career."</p><p> </p><p>Once outside the office, Taiga found himself lingering, his mind racing with thoughts of the future. He desperately wanted to seize the opportunity, but a part of him was tethered to the present, to the little moments he shared with Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>The following days went on like he was walking in a fog. During rehearsals, Taiga found it increasingly difficult to concentrate. He stumbled over his lines, missed cues, and his singing lacked its usual fervor. Hokuto noticed and tried to ask about it carefully at some point, but Taiga blamed it on his tiredness. Which wasn't entirely a lie. </p><p> </p><p>On the fourth day after that, Taiga found himself sitting alone in a small café near the theater, staring at his untouched coffee. The words of Mr. Yamamoto echoed in his mind: “<em>It would be a fantastic step in your career</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>But what kind of career did he want? Did he want to pursue something that would take him away from the comfort and support he had found with the current theater group? And not only that, Hokuto’s presence had become an integral part of his life, a source of unexpected strength and comfort he couldn't explain. Both professionally as well as privately. Their friendship, although still delicate and evolving, meant more to Taiga than he could put into words. The thought of leaving that behind filled him with an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Later on that day, Taiga went to Mr. Yamamoto’s office. The director looked up from his desk, a hopeful expression on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Kyomoto, have you made your decision?” Mr. Yamamoto asked.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a deep breath. “Yes, I have. I appreciate the offer more than I can say, but I’ve decided to decline. My place is here, with the theater and the people I care about.”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Yamamoto’s expression shifted from disappointment to understanding. “Alright. I respect your decision. It’s not an easy choice to make, but you have to do what feels right for you.”</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>And as the lights dimmed and the curtain rose on their performance that night, Taiga knew he was exactly where he was meant to be. He had absolutely no regrets.</p>

</div><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sits in the living room, staring blankly at the television screen. He can't focus. He absently fingers the remote control, flipping through the channels without staying for a few seconds on each one, not really watching anything properly.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, coughs wrack his body, and there seems to be no end to his coughing this time; each cough is more forceful than the last. He coughs again and again until he feels a burning feeling deep in his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stands up and stumbles into the bathroom, clutching his chest as the burning feeling intensifies. He manages to lock the door behind him and take a grip on the sink before he coughs again.</p><p> </p><p>With that last wrenching cough, he spits a cluster of petals into the sink. He gasps for more air until his breathing has calmed down a little bit.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stops as he stares at the petals scattered against the white, glassy surface. The petals look so disgusting like that, all drenched and slimy, sticking together in a clump.</p><p> </p><p><em>Why?</em> he thinks. <em>Why does this have to happen?</em></p><p> </p><p>He raises his head, and his reflection in the mirror looks back at him, his face all pale and his eyes red and watering. He opens the faucet and splashes some cold water against his face. Then he rinses his mouth and watches the petals in the water swirl, washing them down the drain.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The silence was only broken by the faint murmur of voices drifting in from the hallway outside. Taiga barely registered them at first. Until the voices became more clear, and although he didn't want to eavesdrop, he couldn't help overhearing a conversation between two of their colleagues.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you hear? Matsumura Hokuto accepted the role. He's going to have a big side role in the new nationwide movie," one of them said.</p><p> </p><p>A sudden leaden weight settled in Taiga's chest in a second. He strained to hear more, his pulse quickening in his ears. He hoped he had heard it all wrong.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I heard! He didn't waste any time accepting it either. I guess they really wanted him for the part," the other person replied. "He's been talking about wanting to leave this theater behind anyway, so it must be a perfect situation for him."</p><p> </p><p>It sounded like Hokuto had already accepted the role, which had originally been planned for Taiga. That already caused an uncomfortable strain in his neck, but the following thought made it even worse as Taiga realized it; Hokuto had accepted the role immediately, while he had been the one hesitating, wishing for and clinging to something stupid that couldn't matter a less to Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit him hard. Taiga had been holding back, hoping that staying together in the theater might bring them even closer, but Hokuto had moved on without hesitation. He hadn't even considered informing Taiga about it, and he obviously hadn't hesitated to say goodbye to their future projects together. </p><p> </p><p>Later, in the dressing room, Taiga sat at his dressing table. He could sense Hokuto in the same room, but he kept his back turned at him, making sure that there would be no eye contact through the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto approached him when everyone else was out. He came to stand next to Taiga and nudged him. Usually, they didn't touch, so that small gesture was surprising.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey, everything okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's jaw clenched as he avoided Hokuto's gaze. "Yeah, everything's just peachy," he muttered, failing completely to hide his annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>"You seem off. Did something happen?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shot him a glare, his patience wearing thin as he looked at Hokuto's face. "What do you care? You've got your own stuff to worry about."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto recoiled slightly at the sharpness of Taiga's words, but he didn't back down. "Well, I care because you're my friend, Kyomochan. And if something's bothering you, I want to help."</p><p> </p><p>"Help? Like you helped by accepting the movie role without even telling me?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's expression shifted from concern to surprise. "What are you talking about?"</p><p> </p><p>"Don't play dumb with me, Hokuto," Taiga snapped. "I heard the others talking. You accepted that role in the new movie."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah, I was about to tell you that in private but I didn't have a chance yet. I only got to know myself earlier today. But isn't it great? First, Mr. Yamamoto called me in, and then-"</p><p> </p><p>"You can stop bragging. I'm not interested in hearing all that."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto quieted down. He furrowed his brow with a confused expression. "What's going on? Are you angry about something?"</p><p> </p><p>"Angry?" Taiga scoffed. He laughed bitterly. "I get to hear about your new role through other people and you didn't tell me you even auditioned. Then you come to me like nothing and start bragging about your great achievements. And then on top of that, you have the guts to ask me if I'm angry about you something? Care to tell me, when were you planning to tell me? When it'd be your last day here? Or even after that, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"I was about to tell you, of course. But I wasn't thinking it was that relevant for you to know immediately at that very second. I mean, it's my job, not yours"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's temper flared even more at Hokuto's apparent ignorance and the choice of his words. "That's not the point, Hokuto! The point is that you always seem to get everything you want without even trying. It's not fair."</p><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end">

<p>Hokuto stared at Taiga. "I've worked hard for this. It's my dream. You, if anyone, should know that very well."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well, congratulations then. Congratulations on finally being able to leave this shitty theater behind." <em>Congratulations on leaving me behind</em>, he added bitterly to himself in his mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I still don't understand why you're so upset. There's more to this, isn't there?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga's gaze dropped to the floor. He couldn't bring himself to admit that maybe his anger stemmed from some sort of jealousy, maybe from fear of losing Hokuto, maybe from feeling overlooked. Maybe those all were the real reasons. But they all sounded childish even to his own ear.</p>

<p>Somewhere deep inside, Taiga knew he should be happy for Hokuto and he was being unfair. He wanted to be happy for him, he really did. But telling himself he should be feeling something didn't make the ache in his chest disappear. The bitterness, the hurt—it all had bubbled up, clouding his judgment. Somehow, being angry felt easier than admitting he was weak and feared feeling lonely again, just like he had been feeling for a long time before meeting Hokuto.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>"Then help me understand, please. We're friends, right? I can't understand you if you're not talking about it to me."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga's shoulders tensed, and he shook his head. "I don't want to talk about it, okay? Not with you, not with anyone. We're not friends. So, could you just drop it?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The room fell into an uncomfortable silence. Hokuto stood there, clearly hurt and unsure how to bridge the gap that had suddenly appeared between them. Taiga still refused to look at him, focusing instead on the things on his dressing table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, Hokuto sighed. "Fine. If you don't want to talk, then I won't force you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He turned to leave, pausing at the door. "I seriously thought you'd be happy for me. But apparently, I was all wrong about you." He sounded disappointed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga's heart ached at Hokuto's words, the sting of them cutting deeper than he cared to admit. But his pride kept him from responding, his jaw clenching as he swallowed back angry words he would have liked to say.</p>

</div><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stares at the script open on the coffee table. The conversation with his doctor replays in his head. It's like a relentless loop that refuses to fade.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>There's a possibility that the surgery could result in memory loss</em>," the doctor had confirmed.</p><p> </p><p>He rises from the couch and wanders aimlessly around the room. What would it mean to lose his memories? To forget the people he loves, the experiences that have shaped him, the very essence of who he is? Taiga's gaze lands on the photo of him and Juri on top of the shelf, and a sharp pain lances through his chest.</p><p> </p><p>He moves to the window, staring out at the city lights twinkling in the distance. His reflection in the glass looks back at him, a ghost of the person he used to be. He can't bear the thought of becoming a stranger to himself, of looking in the mirror and not recognizing the face staring back.</p><p> </p><p>What if he can't sing anymore? Singing has always been his refuge, his way of expressing emotions he can't put into words. It's more than just a talent, it's a part of his soul. The idea of losing that, of opening his mouth and finding nothing there, sounds so scary.</p><p> </p><p>And his family—his parents—what if he forgets them too? The thought of not remembering his mother's laugh, his father's advice, all the little moments that have made up their life together fills him with an aching sadness. Right now, when he closes his eyes, he can picture his parents' faces, and it makes him <em>feel</em> something. But what if one day, those faces mean nothing to him? What if he sees them and feels nothing, no love? He thinks about the future, about the life he might lose. He thinks about the dreams he has yet to achieve and the experiences he has yet to have. The idea of losing all of that, of becoming a stranger to himself, is terrifying. He doesn't want to forget the person he is. Despite how many times he's been thinking that he doesn't like himself, he has realized that being him is the thing that makes his life so precious, so unique from anyone else's. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga sinks to the floor, his back against the wall, and buries his face in his hands. But the tears don't come. His eyes remain dry, and the only thing he feels is a deep, aching emptiness.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The next evening, Taiga arrived at the show feeling a mix of regret and apprehension that had appeared already when he had been on his way back home the previous evening. He had had time to think. In the end, he had spent a restless night thinking about his last exchange with Hokuto, replaying his harsh words over and over. As he walked into the dressing room area, he noticed Hokuto already there, chatting with a few other cast members as they were about to go for the makeup.</p><p> </p><p>The corners of Hokuto's eyes briefly flicked over to Taiga as he noticed him. Yet, he didn't react in any other way. </p><p> </p><p>"Good evening," Taiga said politely as he joined the group, forcing a smile and trying to sound normal.</p><p> </p><p>"Evening," Hokuto replied dryly. He excused himself quickly, muttering something about changing into his stage costume.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, is he alright?" someone asked Taiga, gesturing behind Hokuto. Taiga shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout the night, Taiga felt the weight of Hokuto's absence despite his physical presence. On stage, Hokuto was, of course, professional, delivering his lines and hitting his marks, but there was a noticeable distance between them during breaks behind the stage. Every time Taiga glanced in Hokuto's direction, he found him standing next to someone else, never sparing Taiga more than a quick glance and then turning his head away.</p><p> </p><p>During intermission, Taiga couldn't hold it back any longer and approached Hokuto directly. He simply couldn't focus on his own work when Hokuto was acting like that. He wanted them to make up as soon as possible because it was ridiculous to sulk over such a meaningless thing from the previous day. Hell, Taiga had had worse fights with Juri, so there was no point he'd let such a thing become between him and Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto," Taiga called softly, catching up to him near the dressing rooms.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned, a look of mild annoyance crossing his face as he realized who was calling him. "What is it"</p><p> </p><p>"Can we please talk?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto glanced around, clearly uncomfortable. "Now's not the time. We have a performance to focus on."</p><p> </p><p>"But that's the point," Taiga pressed. "I can't focus on anything when you're acting like this."</p><p> </p><p>"Acting like what?"</p><p> </p><p>"Like this," Taiga gestured between them. "Cold, distant, weird. Can you stop being like that and act normally? I'm sorry for what I said, and I didn't mean it."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed. "Of course, I agree that we should talk this through at some point. But I think I need some time first. Just give me that, okay?"</p><p> </p><p>"Time?" Taiga repeated. "Didn't you already have time yesterday? Look, I already told you I'm sorry. How much more time do you need?"</p><p> </p><p>"I need enough time to think," Hokuto said calmly. "I need that to arrange my thoughts. I can't do that with you constantly in my face about this."</p><p> </p><p>"I’m <em>constantly</em> in your face?" Taiga asked incredulously. "For your information, I don't need any time to think or, as you put it, arrange my thoughts. What is there even to think about?"</p><p> </p><p>Seriously, Taiga couldn't understand at all. What did Hokuto even mean by all that? Why would he need time to think when there were only simple sorry's to say, and that's it? What was he about to think?</p><p> </p><p>"I told you, now isn't the good time. We have a job to do."</p><p> </p><p>"Can't we just talk it through quickly and then let it be?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes flashed in a way they never did.</p><p> </p><p>"You don’t get it, do you? It's not like you can come to me and blow up like that, then say sorry and assume that everything's all good again magically. Like I said, I need some time and space to sort my thoughts out, and I can't do that right now when there are only 15 minutes until the intermission is over. Don't cause a scene now."</p><p> </p><p>"So, you're angry at me?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, I'm not angry at you. I just need some time to think."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stared at him and felt the anger rising. He couldn't understand why Hokuto's calm expression and collected demeanor triggered him. Without doing anything, it felt like Hokuto was pressing some buttons, which made Taiga even more annoyed. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine," Taiga then blurted. "Maybe you should sort it out on your own then completely. I can leave you alone forever if that's what you want me to do."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's expression hardened, and he stepped closer to Taiga. "If you can't respect my need for some space, then maybe you need to figure out what's wrong with you."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga glared at him, and he slipped out something he instantly regretted.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe nothing's wrong with me. I wouldn't <em>cause a scene</em> if you weren't so damn difficult to deal with to begin with."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes narrowed, and a flicker of hurt fell across his face. But Taiga couldn't stop himself from continuing.</p><p> </p><p>"You know what? Maybe this whole thing was a mistake, getting to even know you in the first place. I thought we were friends, but clearly, you're just a childish selfish person who only cares about himself."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's fists clenched at his sides. "Selfish? You think I'm selfish?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes!" Taiga said. "You never let anyone in. You keep everything to yourself and ask for endless time to yourself while not caring at all about what other people might be feeling. And you just expect everyone else to just deal with it. Do you have any idea how exhausting it is to have a person like you in life?"</p><p> </p><p>"Honestly, you think you're any better? You're so wrapped up in your own insecurities and jealousy that you can't see anything beyond your own nose."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga felt a lump rise in his throat, but he pushed on, unable to stop.</p><p> </p><p>"At least I try," he muttered. "I try to understand people and to be there for them. But you're just a closed book, impossible to read, impossible to understand. It's all about you for yourself."</p><p> </p><p>"You have no idea what you're talking about," Hokuto said. "You don't know anything about what I'm thinking, what I'm dealing with."</p><p> </p><p>"And whose fault is that?" Taiga said back. "Maybe that's the problem that no one knows what you're thinking, what you're dealing with. You just assume it's fine for you to pry on other people's lives but not to give anything back."</p><p> </p><p>"I'm done with this conversation," Hokuto said coldly. "If you can't see past your own issues, then maybe we're indeed better off without each other."</p><p> </p><p>Without another word, Hokuto turned and walked away in the opposite direction from where he had been originally going, leaving Taiga standing there. As Taiga watched him go, he realized he might have just made things even worse, but he was too angry to care.</p><p> </p><p>They managed to get through the performance, though Taiga could sense his singing was a bit off-key at times. The show eventually ended with rousing applause, but Taiga's heart wasn't in it. He went through the motions, barely registering the congratulatory pats on the back from his co-stars and the cheers from the audience. His mind was too full of the argument with Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Backstage, Taiga half-expected Hokuto to approach him, but Hokuto kept his distance. Taiga thought it was unfair that Hokuto was acting like that. He had already ruined the entire stage play for them, keeping Taiga from focusing on the performance. And now, he still wasn't ready to reconcile, but he had left Taiga waiting like an idiot, which felt like the worst thing anyone could do to him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had had enough. He gathered his things quickly and headed for the exit. When he passed by Hokuto, who was talking to another cast member, Taiga couldn't hold back. He stopped just long enough to mutter under his breath, "Leave it, whatever. I don't have anything to say to you any longer."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned but Taiga didn't stop to explain. He continued walking, pushing through the backstage door and heading outside.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>In one hand, Taiga holds his phone, its screen illuminated with the number he has painstakingly dialed and redialed a dozen times. In his other hand, he clutches a small card, its corners worn from being fiddled with incessantly.</p><p> </p><p>Taking a deep breath, he finally presses the call button and brings the phone close to his ear. It rings once, twice, and then someone picks up on the other end.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello," Taiga tries his best to sound composed. "Is this a number for a hanahaki peer support group?"</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had made a decision. He had decided that he wouldn't be the one to contact Hokuto first anymore. He had always been the one to reach out, to mend the gaps, to apologize first when there was a reason to do so. It had made him feel pathetic and clingy, constantly chasing after Hokuto's attention. This time, he would stop. He would wait and see if Hokuto would make the effort to reach out to him. He was tired of being the only one who gave anything to their so-called friendship. </p><p> </p><p>He resolved to focus on his own life, to find contentment and fulfillment without constantly seeking Hokuto's validation. He would wait and see when Hokuto would get in contact with him, if at all. It was a way of reclaiming his own sense of dignity. Deep inside, he hoped so badly that Hokuto would realize what they had lost and make the first move. But if not, Taiga would no longer be the one to break the silence, he was too angry and disappointed to do that any longer. He had made enough sacrifices from his side, so now it was Hokuto's turn to show if he cared at all. </p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, things between him and Hokuto at the theater became more bearable, though. They started acting more normally, exchanging polite greetings and occasional small talk. It wasn't the same as before, but it was better than the cold distance that had settled between them. </p><p> </p><p>But despite that, they never apologized to each other properly. Never had a proper discussion, just the two of them. Hokuto never sent Taiga a message. Every day, Taiga would check his phone, a part of him hoping for a text from Hokuto, but it never came. As the days turned into weeks and their performances went on, Taiga began to accept the silence.</p><p> </p><p>One evening, he finally muted their conversation on LINE. It was a symbolic gesture, a way of letting go of the hope that Hokuto would reach out. Taiga couldn't keep waiting forever. Muting the conversation felt like closing a chapter, allowing him to move forward without constantly looking for something that clearly had never been there. It was better like that. If Hokuto wanted to be his friend again, he should know where to find him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****<br/><br/></p><p>The support group meeting is held in a small room hidden in the hospital's labyrinthine halls. When Taiga enters the room, he sees a small group of people and some chairs in a circle. Taiga avoids people's curious looks but sits down in one of the seats. He already regrets that he's even come there. He can't help but feel that he'd rather be anywhere else. </p><p> </p><p>When the session starts, the group leader, a man in his mid-twenties, rises to his feet and greets them warmly.</p><p> </p><p>"Welcome, everyone," he begins, his gaze sweeping over the group. "I'm glad to see each of you here today. This is a safe space, a place where we can come together to share our experiences and support one another. The personal matters shared here, as well as participant names, will stay here, so everything will be confidential. My name is Kochi Yugo, and I'm in charge of leading the conversation in this group."</p><p> </p><p>As Kochi goes on with his introduction, Taiga fidgets in his seat uncomfortably, his gaze wandering around the corners of the room. He's afraid of looking at other people.</p><p> </p><p>"I can tell that we have some new faces here. If you want to, you could do a short introduction of yourself and your background with the disease. Maybe you can start?"</p><p> </p><p>First, a short woman rises to her feet. She looks frail and thin, half of her face covered with a face mask. She clears her throat. "My name is Kanda Emi. And I have hanahaki disease."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga scoffs to himself.</p><p> </p><p>"I've lived with this disease for as long as I can remember," the woman continues. "It started innocently enough, it was just a small crush on a childhood friend that blossomed into something more. But as the years went by, so too did the intensity of my feelings, until the sickness showed up."</p><p> </p><p>The woman delves into the details of her story, but Taiga can't focus on listening to her. He can't help but think how he doesn't understand this. He can't understand why all of them subject themselves to such suffering, allowing their emotions to spiral out of control. It's impossible to understand why they let things get so out of hand.</p><p> </p><p>As the woman has finally finished her story and takes her seat, Kochi thanks her and then turns his attention to Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"You're also new here. Would you like to share anything?" he asks gently.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga feels the weight of everyone's eyes turning to him. He moves a bit on his chair nervously.</p><p> </p><p>"Um, hi. I'm Kyomoto Taiga, and I'm not really sure what's going on with me."</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>He hesitates, feeling a lump forming in his throat. Every second feels like an eternity. The gazes of others seem to bore into him, filled with something he can't quite place. Maybe pity. Taiga despises it. He doesn't need these people's pity, their unwanted attention. He never asked for any of this, and he didn't want to be here in the first place. Pity is the last thing he's looking for. Pity from these pathetic people is certainly the very last thing he's looking for.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p> </p><p>"I think I might have some unresolved feelings for someone I shouldn't. Or well, it's quite clear that I have feelings for them, go figure. Anyway, it's kind of hopeless. It's not even kind of hopeless, it's impossible. I've been just really stupid. I messed up with things and I can only blame myself."</p><p> </p><p>A heavy silence fills the room as Taiga's words hang in the air. He doesn't understand why no one says anything.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Kochi comes to help, although he continues with a question that doesn't make the situation any less difficult.</p><p> </p><p>"And how does all that make you feel, Kyomoto?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can only muster a weak shrug at that. "I don't know," he says, his unsure voice trailing off until it again fades into an awkward silence.</p><p> </p><p>"That's the thing," he finally adds.</p><p> </p><p>A dozen sympathetic expressions are directed his way and that only heightens his discomfort. Each sad look feels like a spotlight shining directly on his insecurities.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. I'm going to stop torturing you for now," Kochi says with a small, understanding smile. "It's okay. It's normal to have difficulties speaking up."</p><p> </p><p><em>Difficulties speaking up</em>. Kochi says it like that would be new for Taiga.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Then came a particular Wednesday evening, and they were doing final greetings among the whole cast. The last performance was over, and it was always emotional. The stage was filled with laughter, tears, and heartfelt words as everyone reflected on the journey they had shared. The audience cheered at them with final applause, and the buzz of excitement was clearly in the air, but for Taiga, all that was bittersweet.</p><p> </p><p>Backstage, Hokuto was surrounded by well-wishers, his face lit with a bright smile. Taiga watched from a distance as everyone wished him good luck for his future endeavors. They hadn't had a chance to talk properly, and honestly, Taiga had almost forgotten what they had been fighting over in the first place. But he knew he couldn't let Hokuto leave without saying something to him.</p><p> </p><p>In the middle of the corridor, Hokuto was already walking away when Taiga managed to call his name behind him. Hokuto turned around. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey, Hokuto," Taiga began awkwardly. </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hesitated. He would have liked to say that he missed their old times together and regretted their stupid fight. He regretted telling Hokuto that he wouldn't be his friend because that wasn't true. He regretted making that stupid resolution to himself that he wouldn't be the one reaching out any longer.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga didn't know how to put it into words. His pride was still somewhere in the back of his head, reminding him that Hokuto, indeed, hadn't been in contact with him and had just continued living his days like nothing. And the fact that Hokuto was leaving was still real.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked at him questioningly, but suddenly, Taiga could only concentrate on looking at his outdoor jacket on and bag thrown over his shoulder. Hokuto was about to leave. He was really leaving. He was leaving in all senses, a person could leave.</p><p> </p><p>The timing wasn't right, Taiga realized. It wasn't the right moment to pour out his heart like an idiot, to confess something that he wasn't even sure of himself what to confess. It was not the right moment when Hokuto was already halfway out the door, halfway out the whole theater, and he had that look on his face that was telling Taiga to be quick whatever he had to say to him.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto stayed motionless for a moment longer as if indeed waiting for more. But Taiga couldn't force himself to speak. He remained silent, shuffling his feet.</p><p> </p><p>A smile appeared on Hokuto's lips. But it wasn't that genuine smile, not the one he had shown at the <em>hanami</em> picnic during the spring or during their first meeting at the canteen. No, it looked as if he had pulled a mask over his face and was now hiding everything behind that professional actor's face, everything deeper and personal that Taiga had thought he had once seen glimpses of.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I think I'll see you around again?" Hokuto finally said, and what Taiga really wanted to say at that was <em>no, please don't leave me, I'm not okay, let's talk, </em>yet he couldn't let such words out.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, see you around," he said instead. "Good luck, Hokuto."</p><p> </p><p>"Good luck to you, too," Hokuto wished with a wave. Then he turned around and started walking away.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was left standing in the corridor. He simply watched Hokuto's back diminish and eventually disappear behind the corner. Taiga couldn't shake the feeling that some things had been left forever unsaid between them. </p><p> </p><p>For the first time, he realized that maybe his heart had broken a little bit. The emptiness he felt wasn't just about their unresolved fight; it was about losing something he hadn't even fully understood he had wanted in a way he could never have.</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>Truthfully, Taiga had never pictured a perfect happily-ever-after for them. He hadn't determined precisely what he wanted, but he had felt there had been something more between them. He had felt it. He had felt that their connection had been extraordinary, so unique it defied description. He had held onto the belief that there would have been more ahead for them. More time to sort everything out.</p>

<p>For the rest of the meeting, Taiga struggles even more to focus on what anyone else is saying. He keeps staring at the floor, feeling a growing sense of shame for his clumsy, inadequate words. As everyone else continues to speak, Taiga can't shake the feeling that they know exactly what to say and how to express themselves. It's as if they're fluent in a language that he just can't grasp. This has always been Taiga's problem, and it's a hard truth, realizing that his inability to communicate is a most probably big part of why he's ended up here.</p>

<p>When Kochi finally wraps up the meeting, he wishes them all well and hopes to see them again next time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga takes his time getting up from his chair while everyone else quietly disappears around him, slipping back into the anonymity of their own lives, as if the meeting never happened and their paths were never meant to intersect.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p> </p><p>Taiga starts gathering his belongings in silence. Kochi keeps following him with his gaze, although he doesn't say anything. Yet, Taiga notices that.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga decides to question something that bothers him.</p><p> </p><p>"Can I ask why did you decide to lead this group?"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi hums as he gathers his folders and puts them into his bag. "Can I ask why you are so interested in that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Can you psychologists ask only questions during their therapy sessions and never offer anything back?"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi smiles at that, his eyes turning into lines, and wrinkles appear around them. "Actually, first of all, I'm not a licensed psychologist. Second, therapy is a whole different thing from the peer support group."</p><p> </p><p>"Right."</p><p> </p><p>"But it's hard, isn't it?" Kochi continues. "It's hard to speak and open up to someone who isn't sharing anything about themselves. It can feel unnatural at first, but I assure you that within time, it becomes easier."</p><p> </p><p>Again, Taiga would like to ask if Kochi is referring to his own experience, but he would most probably not get a proper answer anyway.</p><p> </p><p>But as he walks to the front doors with him, Taiga notices a tall guy near the parking lot. He rises to stand up from the bench, waving in Kochi's direction. At that moment, Taiga realizes why Kochi has stayed silent, not sharing anything. His story has a happy ending. Simply. Maybe he experienced the disease, but it didn't end his life—at least not in the same way it's going to end for Taiga.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Work had become his refuge. The demanding schedule of his musical roles left little room for introspection. Taiga threw himself into each performance with a fervor that bordered on obsessive. Within two years, he hadn't only left the small theater behind but he had also gotten that much fame under his name that he had also got a manager, a sharp-eyed woman named Yuki. She was very efficient and no-nonsense. She kept his calendar packed, ensuring he moved from one audition to another rehearsal with barely a moment to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>To be honest, it was exactly what he needed.</p><p> </p><p>Outside of work, Taiga's life had settled into a monotonous routine. He would return home late, exhausted, and collapse into bed. Mornings were a blur of hurried breakfasts and rushed commutes. The holidays, when he rarely had them, were spent catching up on sleep or doing mundane chores. Grocery shopping, laundry, cleaning the apartment – the ordinary tasks that filled the gaps in his days. If he still had any extra time, he spent it on watching anime.</p><p> </p><p>He tried going out a couple of times, attempting to have at least something that people could call kind of a social life. Some old friends and new colleagues would invite him to dinners or parties, and he would force himself to attend. But the conversations felt superficial, and most of the time, he didn't enjoy that. He would smile and nod, pretending to be interested, but his mind was always elsewhere. More often than not, he would make excuses to leave early, retreating back to the solitude of his apartment.</p><p> </p><p>There were moments, fleeting and rare, when he allowed himself to think about Hokuto. Late at night, when the city was quiet and the only sound was the ticking of the clock on his wall, some memories would creep in. He would lie in bed and let his mind wander back to the days they had spent together in that small theater.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered the way Hokuto would laugh, a sound so genuine it could light up a room. He thought about the long conversations they used to have, where they would talk about everything and nothing. The comfortable silence they could share, just being in each other's presence. Taiga had never felt that comfort with anyone else and he wondered if it would ever be possible again.</p><p> </p><div class="relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn">

<p>One night, as the rain drummed against the windowpane, Taiga found himself sitting on the bed with his guitar. He played some chords randomly. Then, the melody that had been haunting him for days came out of the instrument. Without thinking, he reached for a notebook and pencil, writing down the notes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He continued to scribble furiously, the rain providing a steady rhythm to his creative process. The song began to take shape, each chord and note falling into place. After a while, he paused, looking over what he had written. It felt right. Like the melody had finally found its home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga strummed the chords again, this time playing the song from start to finish. He muttered some random lyrics to it, words that didn't quite fit but gave the melody a voice. He repeated the process a few times, refining the notes and the rhythm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reasoned to himself that the song didn't tell about anyone in particular. It was just a melody, a collection of chords, notes, and random words. Nothing more.</p>

</div><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga unscrews the cap, dropping two pills into his open palm. He tosses them into his mouth and swallows them with a sip of water. It's something he does every day now, he's gotten used to it in the past few weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Most of the days, Taiga manages to control his cough at work. He tries to suppress it, tries to hold back the constant flow of petals, but it only makes it worse when they do come out.</p><p> </p><p>Until the day comes when during a meeting, a sudden fit of coughing overwhelms him. He feels the petals spilling into his hands as he covers his mouth. Luckily, the petals go unnoticed by his colleagues, who laugh off the incident.</p><p> </p><p>"That was intense, Kyomoto! We thought you were about to choke!" someone jokes.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone is so focused on the fuss and laughing that it goes completely unnoticed how Taiga tucks the petals straight into his pocket, pretending he's only looking for a handkerchief.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The musical was sung completely. There was absolutely no talking, but every line, every reaction, was in a singing format. As if that wouldn't have been challenging enough, the play itself wasn't even a Japanese play—it was a foreign movie. It originated in France and was widely known among everyone who loved such artistic films.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wasn't the type to turn down roles, but this one did concern him for various reasons.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know," he said carefully. </p><p> </p><p>Yuki adjusted her glasses. "The thing is... your name has finally started gaining some fame, the audience knows you. But there's a risk now that they've seen that one side of you, that your fame will be put off as quickly as you've gained it. You wouldn't be the first actor to drop into oblivion after enjoying some time in the spotlight. This is why we don't want you to be stuck with only one kind of role, do we, Kyomoto?"</p><p> </p><p>"I guess not," Taiga responded, seriously pondering his manager's words while clicking his mouth. The wisdom in those was hard to deny. If he wanted to make it big one day, he needed to take risks and step out of his comfort zone to secure those future leading roles in theaters like the Imperial Theater in Tokyo. </p><p> </p><p>"So," Taiga inquired, "who were the other actors they were planning to cast, or was it still in the talks?"</p><p> </p><p>"I have it here, I think it's mostly set already," Yuki replied, handing him the list. Taiga went through it absent-mindedly, spotting some familiar names from Takaki Yuya to Kamishiraishi Mone.</p><p> </p><p>Until Taiga noticed one name among all the other names.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Matsumura Hokuto </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga couldn't help but stare at the name on the paper as if the answer he sought would magically appear if he looked at it long enough.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like it had been ages since he had seen that name associated with anything related to him. The name occasionally popped up somewhere, but it was usually in predictable places. The rolling credits of morning dramas as Taiga brushed his teeth, on billboards he passed while sitting in a car through Harajuku, or when his co-stars casually mentioned the name in conversations.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn't have caused him to react like that. Two years had passed already. There was no reason to feel like a cold liquid metal ran through his stomach. It wasn't like he was seeing that name for the first time or that their history was worth mentioning. People came and went in this field, and sometimes the same people worked together again many times while some never did. In that industry, it wasn't uncommon for ex-spouses, ex-lovers, or former close friends to find themselves working together again. Hokuto was no ex-something to Taiga. He wasn't a former lover or a discarded friend. He was just someone with who Taiga lost contact with. That's it. </p><p> </p><p>"Matsumura? You knew him, right?" Yuki asked, seeking confirmation, observing Taiga's fixated gaze. "You two used to work in the same production before if I remember correctly? Were you close?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, not really," Taiga muttered.</p><p> </p><p>"Not really?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head, all the memories flooding back despite his efforts to suppress them.</p><p> </p><p>"We used to go to the same university but never knew each other there. After that we acted together in one theater production, that's all. We didn't really interact much outside of work."</p><p> </p><p>His manager nodded slowly. "Well, it looks like you'll be working together again," she remarked. "It'll be interesting to see how you both have grown since then."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga forced a smile.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, interesting," he repeated.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Once alone in the dressing room, Taiga retrieves the petals from his pocket.</p><p> </p><p>He looks at them, and something in his stomach drops as he sees a dark color staining them. It's his blood.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga feels furious, like something burning inside him. All of a sudden, he wants to hit something, to scream at someone, maybe even himself. He's been trying really hard every day to control his feelings, to stay sane, not to overthink. He's been advised that meditation and mind control are the keywords for him to help forget, and by forgetting, he can help his symptoms. Ease them.</p><p> </p><p>But it seems that no matter how much he's been trying, things just keep getting worse.</p><p> </p><p>His body is failing him. He loathes the weakness of his own mind that only shows the weakness of his flesh. His whole being is just a feeble vessel that betrays him at every turn like that.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't want that. He doesn't want any of that.</p><p> </p><p>He's so tired.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had replayed the scene in his mind too many times. He had been mentally preparing himself for days, going over what he would say, how he would act.</p><p> </p><p>He had pictured their first meeting after years of silence as awkward, full of unresolved tension and discomfort. He imagined they would go out of their way to avoid each other, exchanging maybe forced pleasantries until they'd eventually reach a breaking point, and their pent-up emotions would boil over into a heated argument. He imagined people around them being in shock when they'd just shout at each other.</p><p> </p><p>But when the day came, it was nothing like he had imagined. When he saw Hokuto standing there, casually chatting with some of their co-stars, it wasn't dramatic at all.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga actually had difficulty recognizing Hokuto at first, and he had to double-check that it was really him. The voice was familiar, but many other things were different. The most notable change was Hokuto's hair, now shorter and more basic-styled, and his clothes, which looked very... normal. There were no bizarre color combinations or odd materials in sight. He looked good and adult. Like a real professional actor.</p><p> </p><p>That familiar smile played on Hokuto's lips as he politely listened to their co-star Mone explaining her recent works, but Taiga knew that smile was reserved for such professional situations. Hokuto's genuine smile had been something else.</p><p> </p><p>When the group spotted him, they happily beckoned Taiga to join them. He felt his heart tighten as he walked to them.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto?" Hokuto said, turning his head to look at Taiga and bowing at him. His voice was soft and tentative. No hellos, no it's been a while, no how are yous. Just Kyomoto and a neutral, friendly look on his face. Taiga bowed stiffly back at him, a mix of different emotions swirling in his chest, but he was unable to do anything else.</p><p> </p><p>When the scriptwriter called them to gather around the table for the first script-reading session, Hokuto walked beside Taiga to take a seat beside him.</p><p> </p><p>"It's been a while," he said, his tone carefully neutral when they sat down.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Taiga replied curtly. "It has."</p><p> </p><p>They started the session. </p><p> </p><p>The scriptwriter stood at the front of the room, a stack of scripts in hand. "Thank you all for being here. This play is a beautiful and bittersweet story set in a coastal town in France. It's about love, choices, and the passage of time. Kyomoto, as you know, you'll be playing the role of Guy, a young mechanic who falls deeply in love with a woman named Geneviève. Your character faces many hardships and has to make some difficult decisions as the war comes between them."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded, flipping through the script. The story was about the bittersweet nature of life, and in a funny way, it all felt too familiar.</p><p> </p><p>"And Matsumura," the scriptwriter continued after introducing Mone and Sayuri's characters, "you'll be playing Roland Cassard, the kind and wealthy jeweler who eventually marries Geneviève. It's a side role, but a crucial one. Roland's character is gentle and supportive, offering Geneviève a different kind of love."</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Taiga was unable to help wondering what had made Hokuto accept such a role. He was already well-established in the film industry, known for leading roles in movies, and his rising star status. Accepting a side character role in a musical play in a fairly small theater seemed out of place for him.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout the session, Taiga stole glances at Hokuto when he thought no one was looking. The way Hokuto read the script aloud was all the same as it used to be; he always got into the role, changing his tone according to the feeling of each line, although it wasn't necessary at that point. They were supposed to only go through the story and the lines without even singing them but Hokuto wanted to bring the emotions from the very beginning. </p><p> </p><p>When the reading-session was over, everyone gathered their belongings, some of them chatting friendly with each other and discussing their first impressions of the story.</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga walked next to Hokuto, he could no longer hold his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>"You didn't cry during the reading," he commented, realizing that there was an unintended accusation in his tone. "It was a sad story. I was surprised that you didn't cry at any part because you used to cry so much. But you didn't cry even when the script writer described the ending scene."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shrugged. He looked unbothered. "People change?" he offered nonchalantly.</p><p> </p><p>That sounded so forced.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, I guess they do," Taiga muttered, unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice. He couldn't help but look at Hokuto's clothing, fitted black pants and a grey T-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, it was nice to see you after a while, Kyomoto," Hokuto wished him. "Catch you later?"</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. Bye."</p><p> </p><p>Despite his efforts to maintain a neutral façade, Taiga couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach.</p><p> </p><p>To be honest, Taiga had hoped that being around Hokuto again would bring some kind of clarity. He had been prepared that their meeting after such a long time would have been dramatic. It was weird, but somehow, Taiga would have been able to deal with everything better if it had been something like that.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Hokuto's indifference had felt like a slap in the face. Like he had stopped totally caring, didn't remember, or didn't <em>want</em> to remember Taiga or their past.</p><div class="mt-1 flex gap-3">

</div><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The flowers that come out are whole flowers already. Taiga is afraid of sleeping at night.</p><p> </p><p>He keeps staring at the ceiling, grasping the edge of his blanket between his fingers and letting his thoughts go through everything he managed to achieve in this life.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe he has other things to achieve, in his next life. Whatever that life would be, in this body or somewhere else.</p><p> </p><p>He regrets surprisingly many things. He regrets not calling his parents often enough and not visiting his grandparents as much as he'd like to. He wishes he had spent more time with his family, listening to their stories and learning from their wisdom, but his career has always seemed to get in the way. He regrets refraining from eating dessert before an important show. He's always claimed that eating dessert would make him feel bloated, which would affect his performance. But he loves eating dessert.</p><p> </p><p>He regrets letting his plant collection wither and die due to his neglect.</p><p> </p><p>He regrets not keeping up with his hobbies enough. He abandoned guitar playing a long time ago, something that he once cherished so much. He never found the time to pick up an instrument again. The thought of his guitar tucked away in its case, its strings gathering dust, suddenly makes him long for the music and creativity he used to find in playing.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking back on all those things makes him sad, so he tries to distract his thoughts somewhere else. But then one name beats louder than anything else when he lets his mind slip to that even for a second, and he can't get it out any longer.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hokuto.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The name reverberates through Taiga's heart like a drumbeat, each repetition pounding against his chest with a dull ache. It's a pain that he's familiar with, yet one that doesn't lose its sting.</p><p> </p><p>It hurts. It hurts so much.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>From then on, their encounters at work were brief and casual, marked by polite exchanges. Despite the friendliness that remained in their interactions, Taiga felt weird whenever he was around Hokuto. Their conversations were laced with a formality that hadn't existed before, each word carefully chosen to maintain a safe distance.</p><p> </p><p>During rehearsals, they worked together efficiently, their professionalism unblemished. However, every interaction outside work felt also rehearsed, as if they were playing roles in a play that continued in real life. When Hokuto spoke to him, he always had that guarded look in his eyes. Taiga swore he could sometimes see glimpses of something else in his eyes, something familiar from the past, but it never stayed there. And Taiga didn't even know what that something had ever been.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, Taiga kept harboring a storm. At times, he wanted to scream, to demand answers from Hokuto. Why had he never messaged him after he had left? Why hadn't he even tried to contact him? The hurt that Taiga had felt had been so deep.</p><p> </p><p>He could still remember so clearly the day when he had realized Hokuto's contact had completely disappeared from his LINE contact list when he had changed his phone to a new one. That moment had hit him hard, the contact list missing Hokuto's name being a confirmation that Hokuto had changed his number and had never dared to inform Taiga about it. It had felt like a true betrayal, proving that Hokuto had chosen to sever their connection without a word or he had simply forgotten Taiga completely.</p><p> </p><p>But the show had to go on, and for now, that meant keeping their complicated history buried beneath a veneer of professionalism. They couldn't risk their work for something, some very twisted relationship, that Taiga found too hard to explain even to himself. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sits on the edge of his bed, the crumpled prescription bags hidden under his pillow. He glances at his phone on the nightstand, its screen dark and silent. The urge to reach out to someone keeps nagging him. It's like a whisper in the back of his mind, reminding him of his doctor and Kochi's words that <em>it'd be good if he managed to tell and talk about it with someone</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He picks up his phone and opens his mother's contact, his fingers hovering over the call button. The thought of her voice, always so warm and loving, tugs at his heart.</p><p> </p><p>She would know what to say, how to make him feel less lonely. She always does. But then he imagines her reaction—the worry, the fear, the sadness in her eyes. He can't bear to put her through that.</p><p> </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Taiga locks his phone and sets it down.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>The atmosphere in the <em>izakaya</em> was happy. There was chatter in every corner of their long table as they were celebrating the end of their first successful rehearsal week. Taiga tried his best to concentrate on the discussion around him but after all, he found himself distracted by the presence of certain someone. Hokuto. It was a surprise to even have him there, considering he had declined all previous invitations to socialize after rehearsals. Yet, there he was, sitting among all of them, talking with other people cheerfully and sipping on his small beer.</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>Seeing Hokuto so effortlessly fit in and enjoy himself was a big contrast to the awkward distance between them. Memories of their unresolved tension filled Taiga's mind. All that joy and happy laughter around him only made his loneliness more intense, making him realize how he didn't have anyone in the industry that he could call a real friend.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Taiga felt suffocated.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><p> </p><p>He stood up and slipped out of the table, muttering to others at the table some vague excuse that he needed some air. He left the bar and settled on the staircase corridor, away from the noisy crowd. From there, he could hear distant laughter and chatter from different floors as background noise.</p><p> </p><p>Leaning against the wall, Taiga closed his eyes for a moment. He really couldn't put his finger on how he felt.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to say so many things to Hokuto, yet he couldn't find the words. They were like strangers now, but he quickly realized bitterly who he was trying to lie to. They were strangers, they had always been strangers. It hurt to admit it, but it was true.</p><p> </p><p>He wished they had some sort of closure back then, some clarity to ease the gnawing uncertainty that now plagued him. Because the absence of resolution felt like a gaping wound, festering with regret and what-ifs. Now, it was too late in any case. They had nothing left to talk about anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Then he heard the door opening, the noise from the bar suddenly coming clearer again.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga raised his head. He had recognized the voice immediately, but seeing Hokuto standing by the doorframe still surprised him a little bit. Hokuto closed the door behind him and came to stand next to Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, I thought you left, but apparently not?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shrugged. "Yeah, just needed some fresh air."</p><p> </p><p>"The air isn't very fresh here," Hokuto remarked and offered a short laugh. Taiga didn't join in the laughter. He could only sit there, watching Hokuto and wondering what that was and how he should react to anything he said.</p><p> </p><p>"So, are you okay?" Hokuto asked.</p><p> </p><p>"Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?"</p><p> </p><p>"Pardon me?"</p><p> </p><p>"I've noticed you don't seem to stay too long after the rehearsal or taking part in activities. Only yesterday, you kept talking about not feeling too well."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto scratched his head, looking a bit weird. "Yeah, I'm fine. I wasn't even properly sick. It was just that I had a bad day because of my anemia. And then I've been busy, you know."</p><p> </p><p>Actually, Taiga didn't know. Hokuto being too busy was an entirely new concept. Also, Taiga had never heard about Hokuto's anemia but that still wasn't as weird as Hokuto saying that he had been busy. Hokuto, who had many times claimed that his life was nothing but busy.</p><p> </p><p>"Busy with what? Do you have some other project going on?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hm. Maybe."</p><p> </p><p>This. This exact pattern was something all too familiar. Hokuto had always done this, dropping some hints about his life and then swiftly shutting the door on any further discussion. It was like teasing an itch without ever scratching it. Taiga couldn’t believe that now, it was still the same old dance. While Hokuto had changed so much, the most frustrating things hadn't changed in him at all. </p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto," Hokuto started hesitantly. "I just wanted to say that I'm glad we're working together again. I know things have been, you know, a bit awkward between us, but I hope we can find a way to make it work."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga felt a lump tightening his throat. He couldn't say a word. He could not trust himself to speak without his annoyance boiling over.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a step closer and came to sit down next to him on the stair-step. His eyes didn't even try to find Taiga's but he kept his gaze to his hands.</p><p> </p><p>"I know it's been a while since we were in touch. Anyway, now that we're working on the same project again, I was hoping we could still try to become friends again. Somehow."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know," Taiga answered slowly. "I mean, we were never really friends, to begin with. We were colleagues who got along well, but I don't think we ever truly knew each other."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was clearly about to say something about that, but he closed his mouth just before that. Maybe he allowed himself to see the truth behind Taiga's words.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not even sure if I should apologize," Hokuto finally began, his every word sounding hesitant. "But just in case, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for acting weird and awkward around you. If it's fine with you, we could just start over. You know, getting to know each other from the start? We don't have to be friends if you don't want to but getting along and talking normally would already be really nice."</p><p> </p><p>It became silent. For a moment, they simply sat there, not speaking a word to each other. Taiga bit his lip. In the end, he nodded stiffly.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes?" Hokuto asked hopefully, turning to look at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Sure. We can try," Taiga said.</p><p> </p><p>"That's enough for me if it's enough for you. For now."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hummed in agreement. </p><p> </p><p>"Anyway, I will go back now," Hokuto said. "I'm sorry for intruding on you like this. But I'm glad everything's settled between us now. Maybe you should also come back, at least to say goodbyes to others before going home?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga watched as Hokuto stood up. Was that all? Hokuto didn't want to say anything else, not to bring up old things back in any way, talk them through, nothing?</p><p> </p><p>Without saying anything, Taiga followed him and rose up to his feet slowly. </p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>Hokuto opened the door and held it for Taiga, who took it to let Hokuto pass first. As Hokuto turned his head over his shoulder, Taiga met his eyes on the step below him. For a brief, intense moment, it felt like he could see <em>that</em> something in Hokuto's eyes again. It was a fleeting glimpse, a mere flicker of something elusive from the past. But the moment was over as quickly as it appeared. </p>

<p>When he trailed behind Hokuto back to their table, Taiga berated himself for harboring such bitterness. It was clear that he hadn't moved on from whatever had once happened between them. But he was willing to try, he needed to try. For both of their sakes. </p>

</div><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Taiga picks up his phone again and opens the messaging app, his fingers hesitating over Hokuto's name before selecting it from the list. He starts typing, then stops. What could he say? "<em>Hey, I have this awful disease that might kill me or make me forget everything and everyone"</em>?</p><p> </p><p>That sounds too melodramatic even to Taiga's own ears.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, he types something simpler.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hey, can we talk?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He stares at the unsent message for a moment, imagining Hokuto's reaction. Would he be surprised to see such a message from Taiga? Would he be willing to talk? Would he even answer?</p><p> </p><p>No. He can't do it. It wouldn't make any sense. They are as done as two people could be, and they will never see each other again.</p><p> </p><p>He hastily deletes the message, erasing the words as if they were never there. Then he puts his phone back on the nightstand, and its screen goes dark.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga brings his head to rest against the mattress. The room feels too small as he takes a breath.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Despite their conversation in the corridor on that particular night at the <em>izakaya</em> and despite promising each other they were trying to get along as colleagues, Taiga felt like he was still walking on thin ice when it came to interactions with Hokuto. It was easy to keep the professional atmosphere with him because Hokuto had always been good at small-talk interactions at work, although his real himself wasn't like that at all. But there was still something going on beneath the surface. Taiga couldn't be sure at all if Hokuto felt it too. Every word exchanged between them seemed to be carefully weighed, each gesture meticulously measured to avoid cracking the normalcy they had established.</p><p> </p><p>Their characters didn’t share scenes but sometimes the backstage interactions were rife with awkward moments. One such incident occurred when they both reached for a yellow umbrella prop at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga and Hokuto’s hands brushed against each other, and they both froze. Taiga quickly pulled back, muttering an apology. Hokuto nodded, his expression neutral, but there was a flicker of something in his eyes that Taiga couldn’t quite decipher.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, I’ll get out of your way,” Taiga said, trying to sound normal as he stepped aside.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s fine. I can wait,” Hokuto replied.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Taiga considered addressing the awkwardness around them, maybe making a joke out of it because it was both horrible and funny in all that weird sense. But he could only play with the thought before the stage manager called them for places.</p><p> </p><p>They kept attending a few afterparties with the rest of the crew, and it was always nice. Most of the time, Hokuto joined, and so did Taiga, though neither of them stayed too late. During these gatherings, Taiga learned new things about Hokuto—how his career had been going and the various projects he had been involved in. It felt like he was slowly getting a better grasp of Hokuto's life. Although Hokuto never particularly talked to Taiga and basically all the conversation was done in small groups. </p><p> </p><p>One evening, the topic of their history finally surfaced awkwardly. Taiga was in the middle of a conversation with Furukawa Yuta and Asazuki Kiwa when someone from the crew picked up on Taiga's mention of his and Hokuto's common acquaintance.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait, you two know each other from before?" the crew member blurted out.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga froze, glancing over at Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>"Um, yeah. We've- crossed paths a few times," Taiga replied, trying to play it off casually. </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't know that," the crew member said, clearly surprised. "Small world, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah," Taiga muttered, feeling a flush of embarrassment creep up his neck. He wasn't sure how much he wanted to reveal about their history, especially with Hokuto right there.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto leaned in slightly. "Right, it's one of those weird coincidences," he added, his voice holding a weight of something Taiga couldn't quite place.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation drifted to other topics, but the whole situation left Taiga feeling a bit awkward. He couldn't help but wonder what Hokuto was thinking. How did he remember, how did he think about those moments? Did he regret them, or did he cherish them in some strange way?</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>Going to the hospital is always hard. It hasn't become any easier although it's become the place he visits most often after the theater.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*****</p><p> </p><p>One evening, after a particularly long evening, Yuma once again invited everyone out for drinks. Taiga immediately agreed happily, saying that it sounded fun. However, Hokuto declined the invitation with a polite apology.</p><p> </p><p>"I can't, I'm meeting someone," he explained.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, your friend from Shizuoka?" Taiga asked. He recalled that Hokuto used to have one best friend from his hometown and he basically didn't hang around with anyone else. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto paused, then shook his head. "No, not that friend."</p><p> </p><p>"Who then?"<br/><br/><br/></p><p>"Just someone."</p><p> </p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full">

<p>A wave of conflicting emotions swept through Taiga immediately as he heard Hokuto's elusive answer. It wasn't anger that simmered within him; it was more like frustration and a hint of hurt. Taiga had thought that their recent interactions had brought them closer, maybe towards something that they once used to be, but it looked like Hokuto still loved continuing to keep things to himself. Taiga questioned the purpose of their attempts to connect. If the result was something like this, what was the point of even trying?<br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>"Fine, keep your secret then. I don't understand this point of being so mysterious all the time," Taiga said tightly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What's with you needing to know everything about everyone?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What's with <em>you</em> needing to keep people at arm's length all the time?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few of their colleagues exchanged nervous glances, sensing the growing tension. Yuma stepped closer, looking between them with concern. "Hey, everything okay here?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes, just perfect," Taiga said sarcastically. Unable to contain his irritation, he muttered an excuse and stormed off to the toilet, telling others to go before him. He locked himself in a stall, taking deep breaths to calm down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taiga waited there a long time, all the time until he was sure everyone had left, and the room became silent.</p>

</div><p> </p><p>When Taiga finally came out, he was surprised to see Hokuto still there. He was sitting on the chair with his arms crossed. Taiga couldn't read his face, it was as if Hokuto looked a bit annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>"Didn't you go to meet your friend?" Taiga asked, unable to hide the bitterness in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed. "No, I didn't go to meet my friend," he answered very slowly, imitating Taiga's way of speaking. Taiga frowned at that. </p><p> </p><p>"What is it?" Taiga asked.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>"I believe I should ask you, Kyomoto, what this is. What was that?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had to stop to ask himself the same question. What was that? It would have sounded stupid if he now started his whining that Hokuto never told him anything and didn't make any effort to make their relationship better and that Taiga felt like he was the only one trying there. This time, though, he knew better. That would have ended up with exactly the same fight they had had years ago. The fight they never even managed to properly make up. He should have learned not to let it rattle his emotions like that.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't believe he found himself in this situation once again. He couldn't believe Hokuto could have such an effect on him.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't know," Taiga answered honestly.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>"Me neither."</p><p> </p><p>There was a weariness in Hokuto's voice, a weariness that Taiga hadn't heard before.</p><p> </p><p>"I've been trying, Kyomoto," Hokuto continued. "I've really been trying."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked. He tried to grasp what Hokuto meant by "trying." Was it about their relationship, their communication—or something else entirely? He couldn't understand what Hokuto was alluding to.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't understand," Taiga admitted.</p><p> </p><p>The invisible weight settled between them, and they fell into silence. Taiga wanted to say something more, to break that suffocating silence that was around them, but the words caught in his throat like a stubborn knot.</p><p> </p><p>And then, without warning, Hokuto broke it with a frustrated puff.</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck," he muttered, more like to himself rather than to Taiga, running his hands through his hair. </p><p> </p><p>He stood up and walked towards Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>The air between them felt charged as they now kept standing there, staring at each other. Taiga could feel the intensity of Hokuto's gaze on him. He swallowed hard with a shaky gulp, the sound almost audible in the stillness of the room. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga also felt the heat rise to his cheeks. His skin tingled with anticipation as he could feel the warmth radiating from Hokuto's physical presence. The urge to reach out, to touch Hokuto, was suddenly almost unbearable.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's gaze softened, and for a moment, the hardness in his expression melted away. He reached up, his hand trembling slightly. He cupped Taiga's cheek, only to bring his mouth to Taiga's neck.</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto's lips touched his neck, Taiga's whole body froze with nervousness.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't move, couldn't even hear anything except his own pounding heartbeat as he stood there paralyzed.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's lips moved slowly against Taiga's neck, trailing wet kisses along his skin. It was so electric, making Taiga's breath hitch in his throat. Then the shaking started. He closed his eyes, trying to steady himself, but the intensity of the moment was too much. His hands twitched at his sides as he kept shaking. His fingers curled into fists as he fought the urge to reach out and pull Hokuto closer. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's other hand came up to rest on Taiga's hip as the kisses on his neck grew more insistent, and Taiga felt a rush of heat flooding down between his legs. He tilted his head slightly, giving Hokuto better access, and let out a soft, involuntary moan. The sound seemed to break through the last of his hesitation, and he finally lifted his hands, placing them on Hokuto's hips. Hokuto brought his hands on top of Taiga's, squeezing them and then slowly bringing them to Taiga's belt. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto opened the belt and unzipped his pants. He reached into Taiga's underwear and pulled out his cock.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto," Taiga squeaked, one hand on Hokuto's shoulder and the other now gripping the edge of the table.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you want?" Hokuto demanded. He dragged his thumb from the base of Taiga's cock to its tip.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah," Taiga gasped. He could feel himself growing harder and harder in Hokuto's grasp. "I want this. I want you."</p><p> </p><p>"I want this too," Hokuto murmured. His words were slightly slurred, but he sounded sure and confident. His breath came to tickle Taiga's ear and he licked his earlobe. Taiga shivered.</p><p> </p><p>"Let me-," Taiga whispered, squeaking him a little bit further from Hokuto just to drop to his knees. His face was now hovering over Hokuto's crotch, the heat and want radiating from him.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto-" Taiga murmured as if he was asking for permission. Hokuto nodded and Taiga reached out with a hand and groped around the button of his pants before tugging at his zipper and pulling his own cock out. "Can I?" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto didn't respond verbally anymore. Instead, he gasped loudly and tangled his fingers in Taiga's hair, then carefully urged his head closer to his cock. Taiga obliged, wrapping his mouth around the head.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto emitted a throaty sound, but Taiga kept sucking him slowly and deeply, tracing his tongue over the raised veins of his cock. Hokuto's hand alternated between gentle strokes through Taiga's hair and firmer grips.</p><p> </p><p>"Oops, sorry, my bad," Hokuto whispered as he bucked his hips, but Taiga reassured him with a muffled sound, humming when Hokuto's legs trembled with pleasure. He placed his hand behind Hokuto's left thigh and urged him to move.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto fucked Taiga's mouth, his breathing becoming loud and labored, and Taiga gripped the back of his thigh harder.</p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto," Hokuto gasped, and Taiga's other hand gripped the base of his cock as he sucked Hokuto's head. Hokuto's legs quivered again, and he came into Taiga's mouth like he was never going to stop, hips and breath jerking erratically. Taiga kept his breath steady through his nose, in and out, as he swallowed Hokuto's come slowly. The taste, the heat, it burned his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto gestured for him to stand up, and Taiga wouldn't waste any time as he was already standing in front of Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was so hard that he thought he might explode then and there, he was sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>"I'll do it," Hokuto groaned. He brought his hand between Taiga's legs.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto stroked his balls quickly before curling his hand around Taiga's erection and started jerking him off, quick and furious, hand warm and slick from pre-cum. Taiga wrapped his own hand around him, guiding Hokuto through it until he hit orgasm and spilled into their hands.</p><p> </p><p>In that fleeting moment, as they stood there leaning against each other, Hokuto looked at him. There was something undefinable in Hokuto's expression, maybe something that could be considered vulnerability. Taiga couldn't quite pinpoint what it was, but it stirred, causing his chest to tighten painfully.</p><p> </p><p>The moment passed in the blink of an eye, Hokuto already turning away and escaping to the toilet, leaving Taiga alone with his racing pulse in his throat.</p>
