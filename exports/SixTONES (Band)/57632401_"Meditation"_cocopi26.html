<p>“Good evening, everyone!”</p><p> </p><p>"Good evening~”</p><p> </p><p>"Welcome back to our first yoga class this weekend. To any of you who just joined us for the first time, welcome. I hope you'll have fun with us.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga lets out a long sigh in silence as he presses his lips, making a thin line. This is his first time doing yoga and little did he know about it . He was never interested to try it until Kochi Yugo, his old friend, asked him to attend his class (yes, Kochi is a professional in yoga) a hundred times after knowing how stressful Taiga is with his work.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi told him that yoga could help him to relax. It could help him to get a peaceful mind and reduce his stress. And of course, doing this could make him healthier.</p><p> </p><p>So Taiga comes.</p><p> </p><p>To tell the truth, he just wants to know and he wants to try. Maybe Kochi just wants to help him to reduce his stress. </p><p> </p><p>Or maybe Kochi is just pitying him.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah. Taiga guesses so. Kochi didn’t ask him to attend his class because he knows how stressed his friend is. But because he knows how single Taiga is.</p><p> </p><p>Another long sigh escapes from his lips as he looks around. There are ten… no… twelve?... twenty… oh, that's a lot.</p><p> </p><p>There are twenty couples standing on the mattress over the room, holding hands as if they don't care while a single man, Taiga, wears his usual black t-shirt with pants, stands alone in the corner of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga knows it's not a usual yoga class.</p><p> </p><p>This is for couples. He can be sure that this yoga’s class is for couples.</p><p> </p><p>How dare Kochi ask him to attend a yoga’s class for couples as he knows clearly that Taiga is single!</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clenches his hands as he glares at Kochi as if he can see him. </p><p> </p><p>Running out of the room is already late. It will be more embarrassing if these couples see him leaving. Taiga cares too much about what they will think about him.</p><p> </p><p>Also, he already paid for this. So he has to stay.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't worry, our poses can be done even when you don't have a partner.”</p><p> </p><p>Oh damn you, Kochi.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can only curse him behind his forced smile as he becomes the main attention. And he starts regretting his decision that he took less than five minutes ago.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, shall we start?" </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga watches the others adjust their position, someone knocks the door.</p><p> </p><p>A man with curly hair, wears a black sleeveless t-shirt and light brown pants walks in and bows once as he says, “I'm sorry for being late, sensei." </p><p> </p><p>He has a very deep voice, Taiga thinks.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stands in the corner of the room in the back row, he wouldn't hear the man's voice if the room wasn't this quiet. </p><p> </p><p>And that is such the sexiest voice he ever heard. </p><p> </p><p>He manages to make Taiga stunned by his voice. And his figure… Taiga can't stop admiring how beautiful the man’s figure is. He has a very nice posture; wide shoulders, long legs and beautiful sharp jawline.</p><p> </p><p>“He is really good-looking…” Taiga mumbled to no one but himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Hokuto! I didn't know you registered for this class too.” Kochi says. Taiga doesn't know how Kochi looks confused as well as he keeps his eyes on Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>"Eh?”</p><p> </p><p>"Hm? This is a class for couples. Do you have someone with you?” Kochi asks again.</p><p> </p><p>"EH?!!”</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no!!!! Sensei, I think I made a mistake. I'll leave now.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga keeps his eyes on him as Hokuto walks out. But before Hokuto completely disappears from their sight, Kochi stops him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Hokuto you don't have to go!" </p><p> </p><p>"B-but sensei, I can't —”</p><p> </p><p>"There is someone who needs to be accompanied. He stands in the back row, there. Would you mind?” Kochi says as he pointed at Taiga with his hands.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga holds his breath as Hokuto looks at him. Gosh, he looks very handsome. His bangs that reach his brows only makes him look more attractive.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga doesn't have the guts to look at him as he walks closer towards him, and takes his place next to him without saying anything.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga is supposed to be mad at Kochi for throwing him into a situation when he has to do something with a stranger.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga doesn't say anything.</p><p> </p><p>He is too busy to calm his pounding heart.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clears his throat as he lowers his head, his lips being pressed as he makes a thin line. For a moment, he really thinks he has to say something to this man.</p><p> </p><p>“Ummm…” Both of them said at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga can't help but let out a chuckle. His eyes that still try to peek at Hokuto catches a smile forming on Hokuto’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>A bright smile, so bright that Taiga has to hold his blushes cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, let's start it!"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi, the instructor starts to speak again.</p><p> </p><p>“This is a super fun yoga that you can actually do with anyone. Your friend, your mom, your family, or your partner. Because some poses we will do are basically for everyone. We will do some poses and keep you comfortable.”</p><p> </p><p>Right, okay. Taiga needs to be comfortable. Even though Kochi pisses him a little, but he is still worth trusting.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath and then he watches Kochi call out someone, a man, a tall white man to accompany him.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s start in a comfortable seated position, back to back.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turns his back towards Hokuto. His heart pounding anew as he feels Hokuto’s back against his.</p><p> </p><p>“Calm down Taiga, don't be too obvious…” Taiga whispers to himself.</p><p> </p><p>He hears Kochi tell them to lean their back against the partner's, relaxing their body by palming their knees. But Taiga can't do that. </p><p> </p><p>Realizing how wide Hokuto's back is against him only causes his heart to pound any louder. He can't settle his weight against his back. It is too difficult. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey..." Taiga's body jolts slightly as he feels Hokuto's voice vibrate behind him.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay. It's my first time attending this partner yoga class too, but I've been attending his class a few times. It'll be okay." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga feels like his tensed body got loosened just by hearing Hokuto's voice. He sounds soft, almost whispering but Taiga still can hear it clearly.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't dare to have a look as he hears Hokuto's voice come through his right ear, telling him once more that it will be fine.</p><p> </p><p>"Put your palm facing down against your knees, and close your eyes. Let your body to relax." Kochi's voice echoes around the room. </p><p> </p><p>"It'll be okay." Hokuto says once more, trying to make Taiga comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. Letting his weight settle against Hokuto's wide back. </p><p> </p><p>"This first pose is to let your body relax with your partner by keeping your eyes closed and breathing slowly. It will be better if you can start to connect your breath with your partner. "</p><p> </p><p>To tell the truth Taiga still wants to run. But Hokuto's voice keeps echoing in his head and causing his body to settle.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's back that moves slowly as he inhales manages to soothe Taiga's body. Taiga himself doesn’t even realize that he breathes in the same rhythm as him.</p><p> </p><p>"Inhale...." </p><p> </p><p>"Exhale..." </p><p> </p><p>The dim light and a soothing melody has been echoing over the room. Kochi's voice becomes softer.</p><p> </p><p>But all Taiga could hear is just Hokuto's soft breath against his back.</p><p> </p><p>It is amazing that his body starts to relax.</p><p> </p><p>However, it happens just for a few moments until Kochi starts to speak again.</p><p> </p><p>"Take a deep breath through your nose and raise your arms over your head slowly, and then exhale and let you body to relax over your partner's back." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes slightly widens as he watches Kochi leans his back against his partner's, and Taiga's lips hanging loosely as he watches Kochi's partner move his body forward, letting Kochi to lie down on him. </p><p> </p><p>"You can let them to take your hands and pull your arms gently to make your shoulders even more relax." </p><p> </p><p>What?!</p><p> </p><p>How can Taiga let himself do that?!</p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind if I do first?" </p><p> </p><p>"Eh?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinks rapidly as he moves his body forward—accidentally— as he lets Hokuto settle his back over his. Whether Taiga lets Hokuto do that or his own body move by itself because he is too shock, Taiga can not tell.</p><p> </p><p>"Now your turn." Hokuto speaks half whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moves his body backward, trying to be calm by taking a deep breath and raising his arms overhead. His lips pursed as he lets out a long breath, but his mind still tries to process everything.</p><p> </p><p>He slightly gasps as Hokuto leans forward, as if he asks Taiga to lie down on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga really thinks he is going to relax, but the next step Hokuto does just starts another tension over his body.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart thuds as Hokuto grabs his hands, opens them wide by interlinking their hands, and pulls him gently as if knowing how stiff Taiga's shoulders are.</p><p> </p><p>"Let your body to relax."</p><p> </p><p>It is not easy but he manages it.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga allows himself to lie down against Hokuto's back, listening to their soft breath mingles in the midst of a slow melody.</p><p> </p><p>"Now the second pose. We're gonna do a gentle twist. Bring your right knee and bend it to the back so your inner left foot connects to the right thigh."</p><p> </p><p>Huh? What did he say?</p><p> </p><p>Like... this? </p><p> </p><p>Taiga keeps throwing many questions to himself as he starts to get confused by what Kochi said. </p><p> </p><p>"Here, like this." Hokuto says as if he can read Taiga's mind. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga moves his knee as has been told and lets his inner foot touch Hokuto's thigh —or butt, he doesn't know, he doesn't want to see it.</p><p> </p><p>"Inhale slowly as your arms sweep high, and then exhale and place your palm against your partner's thighs or knees, and then twist your body gently."</p><p> </p><p>"WHAT?! PLACE MY PALM TO WHERE?! HOW CAN I DO THAT?!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga screams but only himself can hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Does Kochi lose his mind?! He clearly knows Taiga can’t do it with this man. Why did he ask them to do that?!</p><p> </p><p>Oh damn Kochi. Taiga really needs to leave now.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm... I-i'm sorry, but..." </p><p> </p><p>"Am I making you uncomfortable?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga turns his head so fast —that he thought his neck would break— and meets Hokuto's eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga doesn't know why Hokuto looks sad. Did Taiga just offend him? </p><p> </p><p>"No!!" </p><p> </p><p>"No, of course not!" Taiga tries to break the ice between them. "I'm sorry, I just too shy to do it with someone I'm not familiar with. I'm sorry."</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga sees how Hokuto looks down and turns away, his heart squeezes a bit. He shouldn't have told him something like that. Hokuto might have misunderstood him. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't mean what Taiga said was wrong, though. Indeed, he is uncomfortable doing that with a stranger. But the main reason is because he can't do it with a man, a very good looking and attractive man with a very deep voice who sits comfortably next to him.</p><p> </p><p>Just by thinking how this man places his hands on his thigh already drives Taiga crazy.</p><p> </p><p>But if he thought about Hokuto, he might have felt uncomfortable as well. They're completely strangers. Taiga can see Hokuto told the truth when he said it wasn't his first time doing yoga but still...</p><p> </p><p>They're both strangers.</p><p> </p><p>They're just strangers that have to be a <em> partner </em> by accident.</p><p> </p><p>It must have been awkward for Hokuto too.</p><p> </p><p>However, Hokuto looks like he has been trying to comfort Taiga more than he is supposed to.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath as he clenches his black t-shirt before he looks up, meeting Hokuto's eyes and says in a gentle voice, "I'm sorry... Let's do it again." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart thuds once more as Hokuto looks at him and smiles gently.</p><p> </p><p>A very gentle smile that can soothe him.</p><p> </p><p>They start over for the second pose by taking a deep breath slowly, arms sweep high as they exhale before Hokuto starts first by landing his palm gently over Taiga's thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart is still beating faster no matter how hard he tries to calm himself by breathing slowly. Especially when he can feel how soft and warm Hokuto's hand is over his thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a peek at Hokuto's hands and learns how long Hokuto's fingers are. Even his hand looks beautiful. Taiga feels like it will fit his hands perfect— what the... shut up. Taiga needs to focus. </p><p> </p><p>"And now inhale slowly.... and then exhale..." Kochi's voice brings Taiga's mind back to its place.</p><p> </p><p>As time passes in the room, Taiga learns how to relax.</p><p> </p><p>The few next poses helped Taiga to relax even more as those were less romantic—if Taiga could say. They are just doing some more enjoyable poses as if they are playing.</p><p> </p><p>And Taiga finds himself starting to enjoy doing it with Hokuto. He feels he is just having fun with him. They do even talk a little, just a light chit chat while chuckling, though. But that thing helps Taiga to sooth his mind and his heart even more.</p><p> </p><p>He can make sure his heart doesn't pound as hard as before.</p><p> </p><p>"Now, as I see it, some of you have started to enjoy it. Let's make it a little bit romantic." Kochi says as he smiles. </p><p> </p><p>"Everyone please stand up."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles softly as Hokuto reaches out his hand and helps him to stand. He keeps his ears on Kochi without noticing Hokuto's hand that is still holding him. They both are too occupied watching how Kochi does the next pose.</p><p> </p><p>"Now face each other, step closer and let your hands hook your partner's waist." </p><p> </p><p>Both Taiga and Hokuto do what Kochi told them to do. They step closer to each other and Hokuto starts to loop his arms around Taiga's waist. Taiga, who is still too occupied by Kochi's words, doesn’t realize how close Hokuto's face is to him.</p><p> </p><p>He just realized it when Hokuto's breath blows softly against his cheek.</p><p> </p><p>And that is the moment when his heart starts beating faster anew.</p><p> </p><p>Just when he turns his face and meets Hokuto's figure standing in front of him with hands loops around his waist.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Taiga is having too much fun with what they have been doing that he didn't realize Hokuto is taller than him.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe just a few inches taller than him.</p><p> </p><p>Ah. Hokuto even has a mole close to his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looks incredibly good, which causes Taiga to start to hold his own breath.</p><p> </p><p>He darts his eyes faster than anything as Hokuto turns his face and meets his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>This isn't the right time to kiss his mole even when Taiga really wants to do it.</p><p> </p><p>He clears his throat and brings back his sanity to listen to Kochi's words.</p><p> </p><p>"Bend your back, and keep your hands around your partner's waist.</p><p> </p><p>"Trust them, let them hold you as you keep bending your back slowly. Don't forget to inhale....."</p><p> </p><p>"And exhale..."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga bends his back as he breathes slowly. He closes his eyes as he tries to calm his heart. </p><p> </p><p>He can't lie when he says his heart is beating harder than before. His body starts to sweat even more as he feels Hokuto's hand move slowly, as if he is adjusting his hands around Taiga's waist to hold him in a better way.</p><p> </p><p>"And now it's the other's turn. Bend your back slowly, trust your partner. Don't forget to inhale.... and exhale...."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi doesn't lie when he asks them to be a little bit romantic.</p><p> </p><p>Because the next few poses became intimate.</p><p> </p><p>Even more intimate than Taiga thought.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga doesn't know how his body can still do this when his heart almost explodes. Every pose they do afterwards just becomes more intimate. </p><p> </p><p>He can just hope Hokuto won’t realize it when their chest is facing each other.</p><p> </p><p>He can only hope his pounding heart won't embarrass him.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright. For the last pose. We're just gonna do a breathing exercise."</p><p> </p><p>What kind of breathing exercise... Taiga can’t think of anything as Hokuto loops his arms around his waist, as if he lets his soft breath blow against his cheek and makes Taiga has to busy himself by watching Kochi do his pose.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga knows his heart might burst any time soon.</p><p> </p><p>"Now sit down."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath as Hokuto pulls his waist to sit with him.</p><p> </p><p>"One of you will open your legs wide and let the other to come to you as close as possible."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiles at him gently before he says, "come here," </p><p> </p><p>Taiga feels like his body will melt right away.</p><p> </p><p>He can’t stop his mind from imagining himself sitting on Hokuto's thighs and letting his face to just a few inches apart. </p><p> </p><p>No, stop it. Taiga's heart can't take it.</p><p> </p><p>He wants to run.</p><p> </p><p>He needs to walk out now.</p><p> </p><p>But his body settled. The softness on Hokuto's eyes while looking at him has stolen his heart completely.</p><p> </p><p>He can't believe it. He can't believe that he keeps himself to sit on Hokuto's thighs. He even lets himself put his own hands behind Hokuto's back as if they are hugging. </p><p> </p><p>What kind of breathing exercises Kochi meant. Taiga starts to believe Kochi just wants to make them hug.</p><p> </p><p>Breathing exercise or whatever, Taiga can't stop thinking that Kochi just wants to embarrass him in front of this very attractive man.</p><p> </p><p>"Now let your forehead touch your partner's before we start to breathe slowly. You've come this far and let your body fall into the intimacy of this."</p><p> </p><p>Yes, Taiga has come this far and he did let himself fall into it.</p><p> </p><p>He lets his body fall into this trap —he prefers to call it as a trap now— as Hokuto touches his forehead on his.</p><p> </p><p>"Breath slowly. Inhale..... and exhale.... This is the last pose and I want you guys to stay at this moment for a while." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips slightly parted as he let out a soft breath. He doesn't have the guts to look into Hokuto. He doesn't know if Hokuto opens his eyes or he just shuts them like he does. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga keeps breathing slowly. He takes a deep breath and lets out a soft breath again and again until he realizes their breath mingled.</p><p> </p><p>The soft and beautiful symphony of their breath has been created amongst the very soft melody over the room.</p><p> </p><p>It is still unbelievable how Taiga finds himself in comfort of an embrace of a man he just met less than an hour ago.</p><p> </p><p>It is still unbelievable how he can fill his lungs with this man’s scent.</p><p> </p><p>It is still unbelievable how he can be this cozy to sit in his lap.</p><p> </p><p>It is still unbelievable but Taiga finds himself feeling warm. He finds himself feeling completely relaxed in Hokuto's embrace. </p><p> </p><p>And he finds how soft Hokuto's thumb is over his back. He finds how calm he is as their noses brushes against each other.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey..." Hokuto whispers as Taiga inhales.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm?" Taiga says.</p><p> </p><p>"May I know your name?"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Right. Taiga  just remembers that they haven't introduced themselves properly. He knows his name because Kochi called him. But Taiga doesn't mention his own name. They talked, they laughed, they hugged, and now they sit comfortably close to each other without knowing each other's name.</p><p> </p><p>How can this be possible? Taiga met him less than an hour ago. He doesn't introduce himself properly. Yet they did a lot of romantic yoga poses, having fun and feel relaxed. </p><p> </p><p>How can he even think to kiss him while he doesn't even introduce himself?</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga." </p><p> </p><p>"Kyomoto Taiga. Just call me Taiga, it's fine."</p><p> </p><p>Because Taiga doesn't feel any boundaries among them. He feels comfortable with him. He knows it is strange. He won't be like this to any strangers. </p><p> </p><p>But... being with Hokuto is like he got some space to relax. </p><p> </p><p>He got some space to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>And he likes it. He really likes it. </p><p> </p><p>"T-... Taiga..."</p><p> </p><p>"Hmmm?" Taiga hums with eyes are still closed as he slightly adjusts his body to get closer to him. Leaning his forehead while breathing softly in front of Hokuto's face really calms his mind. </p><p> </p><p>"Would you mind if I kiss you?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips part as his lashes flutter open, feeling unsure of what he just heard from Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>Did he just ask him for a kiss? Taiga didn't misheard it, did he? Hokuto, the man he just met, asked him for a kiss? </p><p> </p><p>Taiga slightly gasps as Hokuto moves his hands to hold his arms before he pulls himself away from him. Taiga's heart starts to pound loudly. So loud that he is afraid it will beat the soft song that has been played over the room. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinks once as Hokuto leans closer to him. They were just breathing against each other's lips a few minutes ago, but this time, it feels different. </p><p> </p><p>His eyes close again as Hokuto presses his lips on his, giving a chaste kiss to him. Hokuto's lips feel soft, warm and moist.</p><p> </p><p>And sweet...</p><p> </p><p>The song that has been played around them is suddenly being muted as Hokuto starts to move his lips slowly. Taiga's heart thuds even more as he lets Hokuto to part his lips gently using his, giving him more space to share more kisses.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moves his own hands over Hokuto's back, stroking him gently as Hokuto does the same to him.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's kiss feels so gentle that it sends another warm feeling into Taiga's body. His kiss is so gentle that it makes Taiga feel more relaxed. His heart is beating harder and faster but he still can breathe slowly. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's kiss soothing his body and his mind. Just like how he enjoys doing some poses of yoga earlier, Hokuto's kiss causes Taiga’s body to relax even more.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga inhales slowly as Hokuto's breaks their kiss gently. His own hands move to reach Hokuto's shoulders as Hokuto pulls him into an embrace. He let his body fall into him by leaning his head on Hokuto's wide shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>Just like how Taiga allowed his back to lie down over Hokuto’s earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga touches his own lips with his thumb, still can't believe what they just did. He closes his eyes as Hokuto strokes his hair. His breath is steady but his heart is still beating fast against Hokuto's chest.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga never did yoga before nor attended a yoga class. He came here because Kochi asked him. He was feeling uneasy as he figured out that it was a partner yoga class. He wanted to run away but he didn't.</p><p> </p><p>And he has no regrets about anything.</p><p> </p><p>He feels delighted he didn't walk out. He feels delighted that he chose to settle. And he feels delighted to meet Hokuto here.</p><p><br/>

</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"How was it?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga turns his body and meets Kochi's figure standing next to him. He doesn’t realize the other participants have left.</p><p> </p><p>"I think you enjoyed today's class." Kochi speaks again.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles as he lowers his head, "I did," he replies.</p><p> </p><p>"I enjoyed it. Thank you for forcing me to come to your class." Taiga says while chuckling. He sincerely thanked Kochi for pushing him to come. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto. Matsumura Hokuto. He has been joining my class since three months ago. But it was his first time coming to this class."</p><p> </p><p>"I know."</p><p> </p><p>"Did you get his number? I can ask him to give it to you if you want."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga lets out a long sigh as he makes a thin line on his lips. It didn't surprise him when Hokuto left without giving him his number. He only gave a smile. A beaming smile. But Taiga can’t lie that he really hopes to get his number.</p><p> </p><p>But at the same time, it's not surprising when Hokuto left without saying anything.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay..." </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe I should come to your class again later." He says softly with a thin smile on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah, maybe Taiga should attend Kochi's class again later. Doing yoga helped him to calm his body and mind. Maybe it will work. Maybe it will help him to relax again. Maybe it will help him to reduce his stress.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe he will meet Hokuto again.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe. Just maybe, but it's worth a try.</p><p> </p><p>"Kochi I'm leaving. See you again." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga walks outside after bidding a good-bye. A bottle of water on his hand and a small bag hung on the other hand. Taiga steps outside as his mind still lingers on the previous moments he had earlier. His heart feels a bit heavy as his foot steps onto the wooden floor outside. A long heavy sigh escapes from his lips as he lowers his head. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe he should have been braver. He should have asked Hokuto first. They talked. They laughed. They breathe into each other's arms.</p><p> </p><p>And they kissed.</p><p> </p><p>They had fun.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga should have asked him for his number. He should have been braver because it might be—</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"M... Matsumura?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart starts pounding again as he sees Hokuto standing before him, with a hand stretches on his neck as he smiles shyly.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips slightly part as he stands in surprise after seeing Hokuto there, even still in the same clothes. He hasn't changed his clothes yet.</p><p> </p><p>And he's not exactly gone home as he thought.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm.... K-... Kyomoto..." He sounds a little nervous.</p><p> </p><p>Cute. He's cute.</p><p> </p><p>"I... I was just wondering about..."</p><p> </p><p>"Hmmm?" Taiga asks. His heart is still beating so fast.</p><p> </p><p>"Would you like to have dinner with me?"</p><p> </p><p>The sound of the door sliding echoes around the room, and the voice of a man who was Kochi's partner earlier follows after. </p><p> </p><p>"Taiga? What are you doing here? I thought you'd— Oh Hokuto!" Kochi butting in.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinks as he is too stunned to speak. He still can't believe what he just heard. He doesn't even know what to do as his hand clutches his pants, and his heart throbs louder.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully Kochi's pat on his arm brings himself back to the earth.</p><p> </p><p>"Good luck." Kochi says before he leaves them with a smile, as if he just gave him some courage to speak.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto, a stranger he just met and became his partner by an incident. Hokuto, a stranger that made Taiga's mind relax. Hokuto, a stranger that made him forget how stressful his life was. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokuto, a man that <em>maybe</em> has taken Taiga's heart. </p><p> </p><p>A soft smile etches on Taiga's lips before he nods and says, "sure!"</p><p> </p><p>"Let's have dinner."</p>
