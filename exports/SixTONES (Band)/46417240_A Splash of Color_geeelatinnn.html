    <h2 class="toc-heading">A Splash of Color</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="justify">
  <span>Matsumura Hokuto wants to beat himself up to a pulp. Of all the days that he would arrive on campus right in the nick of time, it just had to be on project topic distribution day. He was usually first in line for things like this because that meant he had the liberty to choose either the challenging topic, the easy topic, or the topic that had enough resources to be easy but at the same time challenging.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto’s legs still hurt from distributing perfume samples in a cowboy costume for half the day yesterday. His eyes were tired from staring at the computer screen for a prolonged period after accepting a double shift at the manga cafe he worked at. The perfume sample distribution gig paid him more than other promotional gigs he had in the past since he agreed to be in a costume do that one. The double shift at the manga cafe allowed him to finish a research paper for another class as the owner of the cafe was nice enough to him that he lets Hokuto use the computer while working, which saved Hokuto money as he does not need to add more data to his current prepaid plan (the cheapest offered by the telco company).</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But as they say, it can never be all good. True, he made and saved money because of his various part-time jobs, but it was also those same jobs that landed him at the end of the line for project distribution day. Judging by his current position - with only five people behind him - he just knew he would get the leftover topics. Hokuto had half a mind to blackmail Juri who was ten people apart from him in front but he knew Juri needed luck to get a good topic too.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Watercolor products. It was not exactly a bad product to make a business campaign for. However, Hokuto had the least bit of interest in arts let alone different kinds of watercolor. The project description even encouraged him to be playful with the elements he would include.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Unfortunately, Hokuto was more used to making campaigns for more mechanical and technical kind of products rather than ones that he could be playful with. He wanted safe designs, but because he also needed to make money he could not really resist all the gigs that presented themselves to him which led him to be late today.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Letting out a deep, defeated sigh, Hokuto folded up the paper instructions and stuffed it inside his bag. He had to accept his fate and move on from the consequences of his own actions.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto flipped over the full-capacity sign at the door of the manga cafe. Weekends were usually the busiest days of the manga cafe, but only up until the afternoon as most of the customers who come in during the afternoon usually stayed until night time (some even stayed until the next day). Hokuto loved taking over weekend shifts. He gets more time using the computer during weekends and he can easily fill in someone else’s shift if needed since he had no classes on weekends.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto leisurely scrolled through different art sites. Hoping that looking at all these things he does not even really understand could help spark some inspiration in him. As the night grew deeper and the manga cafe still at full capacity with no one seeming to log out soon, Hokuto resorted to watching Vlogs about museum tours as they were easier to digest late at night rather than watching in-depth documentaries about watercolor and its uses or art per se.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Still, even with the simplest form of Vlogs, Hokuto was still a little lost. Nothing sparked in him for his campaign. One of the videos was about a contemporary art gallery not too far from the manga cafe. The entrance fee was a donation, the visitor will be the one to decide how much they were willing to pay. For someone with a tight budget, Hokuto liked the idea of not having to pay expensive fees just to go see art. He checked the website that was linked on the caption. Apparently, the operating hours of the art gallery was almost the same as his part-time gigs. Hokuto tried to fit visiting an art gallery but he could only squeeze it in between his part-time gigs and going home, which gave him roughly thirty minutes to stay in the gallery before it closes.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>As much as it seemed to be tiring, Hokuto was in no position to fail a class or get below-average marks. For one, he did not have the financial capability to afford a retake of a course. Another reason was that he was aiming to get a full scholarship for graduate school. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto let out a long, defeated sigh. There was nothing else he could do about it.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto strategically chose the area near the gallery to hand out perfume samples. He did not care so much that he had to look around in his cowboy uniform.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The art gallery was situated in a small space between a tailor shop and a pastry shop. The first floor of the gallery was a small space where heavy-looking sculptures were showcased. The stairs lead to the second floor, which was more spacious than the first floor since the second floor was as wide as the first floor, tailor shop, and pastry shop below combined. The second floor hosted more paintings than sculptures. The display was set up to look maze-like as you walk around, for a first-time visitor like Hokuto, it was easy to get confused and end up in the same sections over and over without seeing the other parts of the gallery.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There were still a couple more people inside the gallery as Hokuto walked around. Some even had their own sketchpads and were drawing while seated at randomly placed seats around the gallery. Hokuto found a section that had no one else roaming around and decided to stay there. The paintings displayed in the area were a mixture of oil on canvas and some that were painted using watercolor.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Since the assigned product to him was watercolor, Hokuto decided to spend more time looking at the ones made using watercolor. Especially since he did not have a lot of time left to really spare.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The painting at the far end corner of the room caught Hokuto’s attention.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>“A Mess of Contradictions”</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>K.T.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>It was not particularly as big as the other paintings on the same wall but it was the one that commanded his attention. The painting was made out of different-sized swirls and and curves in both deep-rich colors and playful pastels. Hokuto had no idea what kind of interpretation such a painting has and he did not care about it much. He admired how there was nothing precise about the painting as he sees it, as though it did not care about restrictions or anything.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Something Hokuto could never accomplish in his life. There was always something that restricted his actions: lack of money, class schedules, part-time gig schedules, and scholarship requirements. He knew he led a pretty mechanical life, he could never be playful with anything. Never would he have thought he would feel envious of a painting.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto went to the art gallery every other day for the past week. He was almost done with his campaign but his presentation still lacked a design and although he had sketches of what he wanted the campaign materials to look like, he was still unable to finalize what he wanted.  His frequent trips to the art gallery helped him in his concept, still, he felt that he still lacked the ability to be playful and colorful with his design. Something he really felt vital when it came to running a campaign about watercolor.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“So, you’re here again?” A brown-haired boy that seemed to be around his age approached Hokuto. “I’ve been seeing you around here often. I’ve seen you admire my art as well so I thought I should properly introduce myself. Kyomoto Taiga, third year fine arts student.” Taiga extended his hand for a handshake.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto shook his hand. “Matsumura Hokuto, third year economics student.” Hokuto felt a firm grip from Taiga’s hand before both of them let go. “You’re K.T? Your paintings are almost always in watercolor. I’m making a campaign for watercolor in one of my classes so I was really interested in the paintings in that medium.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga nodded as he listened on to Hokuto. “But you always come here at almost closing time. I see your logs since I work part-time here whenever I can.”</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>“Ah,” Hokuto nervously scratched his neck. “You see, I can only come after my part time work."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Working student, I see." Taiga said.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>One look at Taiga and Hokuto could already smell money. It might have been the more subtle pieces but for someone that was knowledgeable enough it was easy to figure out that Taiga was wearing luxury brands.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Tell you what. I have more watercolor paintings over at my studio. I can take you there so you could have a look without needing to leave in a hurry. Unlike the gallery, my studio does not have a closing time."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Are you sure? It is getting pretty late."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga shrugged his shoulders. "I have to paint a course requirement so I'll really be over at my studio anyway." He seemed to have noticed Hokuto's reluctance. "I have a table and internet connection there. I've seen you working on your laptop in a rush here."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"If you really don't mind. I'll be intruding in your studio then."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">
  <span>* * *</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto froze where he stood when they got inside Taiga's studio. The place was almost thrice the size of his studio apartment and it was not even Taiga's apartment. It was really just an art studio, with a second floor that was only half the size of the first floor. The place was liveable in itself. There was a couch and a small table over at what seemed to be a make-shift pantry. The other areas of the place had different kinds of art pieces and art materials around. Various easels had canvas resting over them and a stool that held art materials beside them. Some pieces looked like a work in progress but there were some that seemed like finished works.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Make yourself at home, I guess? I won't mind you looking around so no need to ask for permission." Taiga said as he settled his bag and coat on the sofa. He proceeded to work on one of the canvases situated at an easel.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto looked around the studio. Being careful not to accidentally knock down anything as he walked around.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>His art are as beautiful as he is</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Hokuto thought to himself, stealing glances at Taiga from time to time.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto stopped in between two watercolor paintings. He took out his notebook and jotted down some ideas for his campaign.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You see something you like?" Taiga suddenly appeared behind him, making Hokuto jump to his heel. "So, how do you plan on repaying me?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Wh-what?" Hokuto stammered. "I- " He let out a sigh. "I don't have much money."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I didn't ask 'how much?' I asked you how." Taiga closed in the distance between them. They stood close enough to each other that their toes were touching. Taiga cupped Hokuto's face. "Nothing in this world is free, baby. Of course, there's something you must do in return for this favor. I won't be asking for money but if I were to be in charge, I would ask for you to be my nude model."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Are you out of your mind!?" Hokuto took a step back. He knocked over a stool that was holding a pallet of watercolor. "I'm so sorry!" He bent down in panic to pick up the stuff that was scattered all over. Accidentally, he stepped on a paintbrush and it broke in half.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga clicked his tongue. "What are you going to do now?" He said as he watched Hokuto pick up the broken brush and the cracked watercolor pallet. "The brush alone is five thousand yen and the watercolor pallet is fifteen thousand yen."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto's eyes grew. Panic was painted all over his face. "I don't have that kind of money. Oh god. Can I pay you in installments?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Well, I know a way that won't cost money for you."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Be my nude model and all debts will be written off."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto snuggled closer to the warm body next to him. He felt a hand caress his head. "Good morning to you." He said in a sleepy voice.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"It is morning already."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Hokuto slowly opened his eyes and looked up, Taiga was already awake and reading a manga with one arm under Hokuto. "Why didn't you wake me up?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Taiga chuckled. He placed down his manga on the nightstand. He wrapped his arms around Hokuto and pulled him close before planting a kiss on the top of his head. "You were sleeping so soundly that I did not want to wake you up. Do you remember what you were dreaming about?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>'The first time we met," Hokuto pushed himself closer to Taiga. "Maybe I should keep watch on you. I forgot that you liked hitting on people that visit the gallery and inviting them over."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I should keep tabs on you too. You say yes to strangers' invitations."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>The two laughed in unison.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"I can't believe I'm engaged to an heir of an art supply company. If I had known your family owned the brand you were using -"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"You wouldn't have modeled nude for me?" Taiga interrupted him.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Hell yeah! Why do you have expensive watercolor lying around anyway? Your set cost more than I made in a day back then. Your family's brand carries affordable watercolor too!"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Our family," Taiga corrected him. "Your marrying me soon so 'your' now turns to 'our,' alright? Besides, you should know by now that I have my ways of getting what I want."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"And you wanted me nude back then?"</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Yes." Taiga shamelessly admitted. "I haven't regretted anything ever since."</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Maybe I was lucky that I was late for once during project assignments. I wouldn't have met you if I did not get watercolor that day."</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <span>"Don't be so sure about that," Taiga smirked.</span>
