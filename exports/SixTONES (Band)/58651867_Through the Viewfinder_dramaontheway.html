<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga thought he had it all figured out. But after his photography career fizzled out, he’s left with nothing but a camera full of failed dreams and a return ticket to his small hometown. Reuniting with his younger brother isn’t exactly what he envisioned at 27, especially since Shintaro has always been the more responsible one, a role reversal that gnaws at his pride.</p><p>Reconnecting with his roots seems like the best way to get back on track, but Taiga can’t shake that feeling that he’s somehow lost himself along the way. Enter Hokuto, a familiar face from Taiga’s past. Hokuto has changed—no longer the awkward boy he remembers, but a quietly introspective man with a kind heart.
</p><p>And Taiga can’t help but be drawn in.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Taiga lay sprawled on the tatami mat, his body a limp echo of the crumpled candy wrappers strewn around him. The ceiling fan whirred overhead, its monotonous rhythm matching the dull ache in his chest. He blinked slowly, tracing the fan’s lazy rotation with vacant eyes.</p><p>“At least you’re consistent,” he muttered to the fan. “Unlike my life.”</p><p>A snort of bitter laughter escaped his lips. He’d traded the pulsing energy of Tokyo for this—a silent room in his family’s ryokan, where the most exciting event was watching dust motes dance in the sunlight.</p><p>The irony wasn’t lost on him. He’d once chased dreams with a camera in hand, capturing moments of beauty and life.</p><p>Now, he couldn’t even muster the energy to reach for the TV remote.</p><p>Taiga’s gaze drifted to the makeshift darkroom in the corner. The equipment sat untouched, a shrine to his broken ambitions.</p><p>He’d sworn off photography, hadn’t he? So why did his fingers still itch for the familiar weight of a camera?</p><p>“Because you’re a glutton for punishment,” he answered himself, reaching for another piece of candy. The wrapper crinkled loudly in the quiet room as he unwrapped it, the sound grating on his nerves.</p><p>He popped the candy in his mouth, letting the sweetness flood his taste buds. It was a poor substitute for the rush of creativity he used to feel, but it was something.</p><p>Anything to fill the void that failure had left behind.</p><p>The fan continued its endless rotation, and Taiga found a perverse comfort in its constancy. It didn’t judge. It didn’t have expectations.</p><p>It just… was.</p><p>Unlike the TV, with its parade of successful people living their best lives, the fan didn’t mock him with false promises of a better tomorrow.</p><p>“At least you’re honest,” Taiga mumbled, raising a half-hearted toast with an empty candy wrapper. “You spin in circles, going nowhere. Just like me.”</p><p>The door slid open with a soft thud, breaking the monotony of Taiga’s self-imposed isolation. Shintaro’s stocky silhouette filled the doorway, his broad shoulders blocking what little light filtered in from the hallway.”</p><p>“Jesus, Taiga-nii, don’t you look pathetic,” Shintaro remarked, his tone a mix of exasperation and concern.</p><p>Taiga didn’t bother to lift his head. “Thanks for the ego boost, little brother. Really needed that today.”</p><p>Shintaro’s footsteps padded across the tatami, crinkling candy wrappers as he approached. “This is getting ridiculous, nii-chan. You can’t keep wallowing like this.”</p><p>“Watch me,” Taiga muttered, but there was no real fight in his voice.</p><p>Without warning, Shintaro strode to the window. His hand grasped the curtain, and with one swift motion, he yanked it open.</p><p>“No!” Taiga yelped, throwing an arm over his eyes as sunlight flooded the room. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Letting some life back into this cave you call a room,” Shintaro replied, undeterred.</p><p>Taiga hissed dramatically, curling into a ball on the floor. “I’m melting! Melting! Oh, what a world!”</p><p>Shintaro snorted. “You’re not the fucking Wicked Witch of the West, Taiga-nii.”</p><p>“No,” Taiga agreed, peeking through his fingers. “I’m obviously a vampire. Defeated by the cruel light of day, courtesy of my traitorous brother. It’s probably part of some overly complicated plot involving ancient prophecies and brooding immortals with questionable fashion sense.”</p><p>“Right,” Shintaro drawled. “And I suppose those candy wrappers are actually the ashes of your victims?”</p><p>Taiga considered for a moment. “They could be. Victims of my poor life choices, at least.”</p><p>Shintaro crouched down, peering at Taiga’s face. “Speaking of poor life choices, you’ve got chocolate all over your face. And when’s the last time you showered? You smell like a locker room after a sumo tournament.”</p><p>Taiga scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. “Please. My natural musk is a delicate bouquet of masculinity. I’ll have you know I can go weeks without deodorant before anyone notices.”</p><p>“Really?” Shintaro raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>Taiga hesitated, then surreptitiously lifted an arm to sniff. His nose wrinkled involuntarily. “Shit, okay, maybe you have a point,” he conceded grudgingly.</p><p>“Thought so,” Shintaro said, a hint of smugness in his voice. He stood up, offering a hand to Taiga. “Come on, time to rejoin the land of the living. And the bathing.”</p><p>Taiga stared at the offered hand for a moment before reluctantly taking it. As Shintaro pulled him to his feet, Taiga felt a pang of… something. Gratitude? Shame?</p><p>It was hard to pin down.</p><p>“When did you become such a responsible adult?” Taiga grumbled, but there was no real heat in his words.</p><p>Shintaro shrugged. “Someone had to step up while you were off chasing your dreams in Tokyo.”</p><p>The words could have been accusatory, but Shintaro’s tone was gentle.</p><p>Still, Taiga felt the weight of them, a reminder of the expectations he’d failed to meet.</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Taiga mumbled, running a hand through his greasy hair, “looks like those dreams crashed and burned. Now you’re stuck babysitting your failure of an older brother.”</p><p>“Hey,” Shintaro said firmly, gripping Taiga’s shoulder. “You’re not a failure. You’re just… figuring things out. And I’m here to help, whether you like it or not.”</p><p>Taiga met his brother’s gaze, seeing the sincerity there. It was almost too much to bear. “Even if that means dragging me kicking and screaming into basic hygiene?”</p><p>“Especially then,” Shintaro nodded solemnly. “Now, go take a shower before I have to hose you down myself. I’ve given you two whole days to pout, but now it’s time to rejoin the world of the living.”</p><p>Taiga bristled at the accusation. “I’m not pouting,” he protested, his voice rising an octave. “This is dignified self-reflection.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Shintaro nodded, unconvinced. He pointed at Taiga’s face. “And I suppose that jutting lower lip is just part of your ‘dignified’ expression?”</p><p>“Fine,” he grumbled, “maybe I’m wallowing a little. But I’ve earned it, don’t you think? My dreams just went up in smoke.”</p><p>Shintaro’s face softened slightly. “I get it, Taiga-nii. But you can’t stay in this room forever, surrounded by candy wrappers and self-pity.” He extended his hand once more. “Come on. Let’s start small. A shower, some fresh air. Maybe even actual human interaction that doesn’t involve me nagging you.”</p><p>Taiga eyed the offered hand, torn between his desire to stay curled up in his cocoon of misery and the growing realization that Shintaro might have a point.</p><p>His bladder chose that moment to remind him of more pressing concerns.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Taiga relented, grasping Shintaro’s hand. “But only because I need to use the bathroom. Not because you’re right or anything.”</p><p>As Shintaro pulled him to his feet, Taiga felt a twinge of guilt. He knew, deep down, that his brother was right. The past two days of self-imposed exile hadn’t made him feel any better about his situation. If anything, they’d just given him more time to replay his failures on a loop in his head.</p><p>“There,” Shintaro said, clapping Taiga on the shoulder. “Was that so hard?”</p><p>“Yes,” Taiga replied automatically, but there was less conviction in his voice than before. “Absolutely traumatic. I may never recover.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Two days ago, Taiga’s life in Tokyo had finally crumbled beyond repair. The city that had once seemed full of promise and opportunity had become a labyrinth of disappointment and failure.</p><p>With trembling hands and a lump in his throat, he’d dialed Shintaro’s number, swallowing his pride with each ring.</p><p>“Shin?” Taiga had said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I… I need help.”</p><p>Shintaro hadn’t hesitated. “I’m on my way,” he’d replied, no questions asked.</p><p>The next day, Shintaro had arrived in Tokyo, stepping off the plane with a determined set to his shoulders. He’d found Taiga in his cramped apartment, surrounded by the remnants of his shattered dreams—half-finished photo projects, rejected portfolio submissions, and past-due bills.</p><p>Taiga had expected judgment, maybe even a lecture about responsibility and planning.</p><p>Instead, Shintaro had simply rolled up his sleeves and started packing boxes. “Let’s get you home,” he’d said, his voice gentle but firm.</p><p>They’d spent the day dismantling Taiga’s life in Tokyo. Each item packed away felt like an admission of defeat, but Shintaro’s steady presence had made it bearable. His little brother, who had never fully understood Taiga’s need to leave Kumamoto, was now the one bringing him back.</p><p>The plane ride back to Kumamoto had been quiet. Shintaro had let him brood, offering silent support in the form of a strong shoulder to lean on when exhaustion finally overtook Taiga.</p><p>When they’d arrived in Kumamoto, the familiar sights and smells had hit Taiga like a punch to the gut. This was what he’d run from, what he’d been so sure he’d outgrown.</p><p>Now, tail between his legs, he was crawling back.</p><p>Shintaro had helped him settle into his old room at the ryokan, unpacking the essentials and leaving the rest for later. He’d been patient, allowing Taiga space to process his return.</p><p>But now, two days later, it seemed Shintaro had decided that enough was enough. It was time for Taiga to face the music.</p><p>And apparently, a much-needed shower.</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro wrinkled his nose as he gave Taiga a once-over. “Okay, first things first. You need a shower. And then put on something casual but nice.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, confusion momentarily overriding his self-pity. “Why? What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s a secret,” Shintaro replied, a hint of mischief in his eyes.</p><p>“A secret?” Taiga groaned. “No, no secrets. No surprises. Just let me wallow in peace. I want to order some greasy takeout and hide under my covers until… I don’t know, next year? Maybe the year after?”</p><p>Shintaro shook his head, undeterred. “Not happening, big brother. You’ve had your pity party. Now it’s time to rejoin the land of the living.”</p><p>“But—" Taiga started to protest, but Shintaro was already moving. With surprising strength, he began physically steering Taiga toward the bathroom.</p><p>“No buts,” Shintaro insisted, his hands firmly on Taiga’s shoulders. “Shower. Clothes. Out. In that order.”</p><p>Taiga dug in his heels, trying to resist. “Come on, Shin. I’m not ready for… whatever this is. Can’t we just stay in? I promise I’ll shower tomorrow.”</p><p>“Nope,” Shintaro said, popping the ‘p’ sound. He gave Taiga another push. “You’re not getting out of this. Trust me, okay?”</p><p>Taiga stumbled forward, his protests dying on his lips as he saw the determined look in Shintaro’s eyes. He knew that look. It was the same one Shintaro got when he was learning how to balance the ryokan’s books or dealing with difficult customers. There was no arguing with him when he was like this.</p><p>“Fine,” Taiga sighed, shoulders slumping in defeat. “But if this turns out to be some kind of intervention or surprise party, I’m disowning you as my brother.”</p><p>Shintaro, clearly not trusting Taiga to follow through, trailed him to the <em>en suite</em> bathroom. As Taiga leaned against the doorframe, Shintaro bustled past him, turning on the shower with practiced efficiency.</p><p>“You know, I am capable of bathing myself,” Taiga grumbled, watching as his younger brother adjusted the water temperature. “Been doing it for years now.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Shintaro replied, unconvinced. He reached for a fresh towel, setting it on the counter within easy reach. “And yet, here we are.”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, but a small part of him appreciated Shintaro’s care, even if he’d never admit it out loud. As steam began to fill the bathroom, Taiga tried another tactic.</p><p>“Wait a second,” he said, frowning. “Aren’t you skipping work for this? What about your assistant manager duties?”</p><p>Shintaro paused, giving Taiga a strange look. “Taiga-nii, it’s Sunday. I can afford a day off.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, genuinely surprised. “Sunday? But… I could’ve sworn it was Wednesday.”</p><p>“Nope,” Shintaro said, shaking his head. “You’ve been holed up in here since Friday night. It’s definitely Sunday.”</p><p>The realization hit Taiga like a bucket of cold water. He’d lost track of time completely, days blurring together in his cocoon of misery. The thought was sobering, and a little frightening.</p><p>“Oh,” was all he could manage, suddenly feeling very small.</p><p>Shintaro’s expression softened, understanding dawning in his eyes. He stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Taiga’s shoulder. “Hey, it’s okay. That’s why I’m here, alright? To help you get back on track.”</p><p>Taiga felt a lump form in his throat. “Thanks, Shin,” he said softly, the sincerity in his voice surprising even himself. “For picking me up. For always rescuing me.”</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a memory flashed through Taiga's mind. It was five years ago, just before he’d left for Tokyo. Shintaro had come to his rescue then too, though under very different circumstances.</p><p>Taiga had been dating Ryota, a charming but volatile man who worked as a bartender in downtown Kumamoto. At first, it had been exciting — Ryota was passionate, spontaneous, everything Taiga thought he wanted. But as the months wore on, Ryota’s passion turned to possessiveness, his spontaneity to unpredictability.</p><p>One night, after a particularly heated argument, Ryota had raised his hand, stopping just short of striking Taiga. The look in his eyes had been enough to send Taiga running, straight to Shintaro’s room at the ryokan.</p><p>Shintaro hadn’t asked questions. He’d simply held Taiga as he cried, then calmly walked to Ryota’s apartment the next day to end things on Taiga’s behalf.</p><p>When he returned, his knuckles were bruised, but he just shrugged and said, “It’s taken care of.”</p><p>It was in the aftermath of that incident that Taiga had decided to move to Tokyo. He wanted to prove — to himself, to Shintaro, to everyone — that he could stand on his own two feet. That he could achieve his dreams of becoming a renowned photographer without needing to be rescued.</p><p>But Tokyo had been a harsh teacher. The city’s relentless pace and sky-high living costs had quickly eaten away at his meager resources. Without the safety net of nearby family, every setback felt magnified, every struggle more isolating.</p><p>He’d tried, god knows he’d tried. Freelance photography gigs came sporadically, feast or famine with no middle ground. One month he’d be flush with cash from a lucrative wedding shoot, the next scraping by on instant ramen and convenience store coffee.</p><p>His part-time job at a small diner in Shibuya had provided some stability, but between rent, utilities, and the constant need to upgrade his camera equipment, it was never quite enough.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as he stands in the steamy bathroom, remembering the countless nights he’d sat at his tiny kitchen table, staring at bills and bank statements, trying to make the numbers add up. He’d taken on more shifts at the diner, sacrificed sleep for late-night editing sessions, even considered selling some of his beloved camera lenses.</p><p>But in the end, it hadn’t been enough to keep him financially afloat in the unforgiving sea of Tokyo’s economy.</p><p>The cascade of events that led to Taiga’s current predicament played out in his mind like a cruel slideshow. It had started when his roommate, Kenji, announced his engagement.</p><p>Initially, Taiga had been happy for his friend, but that joy quickly turned to panic when Kenji revealed he’d be moving out to live with his fiancée.</p><p>Suddenly, Taiga found himself solely responsible for the rent on their modest two-bedroom apartment. He’d tried to make it work, picking up extra shifts at the diner and taking on any photography gig he could find, no matter how small.</p><p>But it wasn’t enough. The rent payments started coming in late, then incomplete, and finally not at all.</p><p>As if the universe was conspiring against him, it was during this financial spiral that Taiga had his last photo exhibit. He’d poured everything into it — his savings, his time, his heart. The series, a stark exploration of urban isolation, was supposed to be his breakthrough moment.</p><p>Instead, it had been a disaster. The reviews were brutal, tearing apart his technique, his vision, his very worth as an artist.</p><p>One particularly scathing critique still echoed in his mind: “Kyomoto’s work is as empty and soulless as the city he attempts to capture.”</p><p>The final blow came in the form of an eviction notice, taped unceremoniously to his apartment door. Taiga had stared at it for what felt like hours, the harsh reality of his situation finally sinking in.</p><p>With trembling hands, he’d reached for his phone and called the one person he knew would always answer: Shintaro.</p><p>Shintaro’s voice cut through Taiga's reverie. “Alright, enough stalling. Get in the shower already. And don’t take too long, we’ve got places to be.” With that, he stepped out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Taiga stared at the closed door for a moment, a small spark of defiance igniting in his chest. If Shintaro wanted him to hurry, well… he’d do the opposite.</p><p>Taiga reached for his phone, scrolling through his playlists. With a few taps on his phone, his carefully curated “Sad Songs for Sad Times” playlist began to fill the steamy bathroom through the speakers. The melancholic notes of Sufjan Stevens’ “Fourth of July” enveloped him, fueling his desire for a good, old-fashioned wallow.</p><p>Stripping off his days-old clothes, he stepped into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over him. As the first melancholic notes filled the steamy air, Taiga closed his eyes, fully prepared to wallow for as long as possible.</p><p>Still, as the droplets cascaded over his body, he felt a small weight lift from his shoulders. Shintaro was right, as usual – a shower was exactly what he needed.</p><p>“This is perfect,” Taiga muttered to himself, grabbing the shampoo bottle. “A nice, long shower to match my nice, long pity party.”</p><p>He lathered up his hair, letting the suds drip down his face like soapy tears. “Yeah, that’s the stuff,” he mumbled, leaning his head back to let the water rinse away the bubbles.</p><p>As the next song, a haunting ballad by Bon Iver, began to play, Taiga felt himself slipping deeper into his melancholy. He closed his eyes, picturing himself as the tragic hero of his own indie film, doomed to a life of misunderstood artistic struggle.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud bang on the bathroom door jolted Taiga from his reverie.</p><p>“Hey!” Shintaro’s voice called out, muffled but insistent. “You better not be using up all the hot water with your emo shower routine!”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, though a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Trust Shintaro to rain on his pity parade. “I’m just getting started!” he shouted back, reaching for the conditioner. “You’ll have to pry me out of here when I’m good and pruney!”</p><p>There was a pause, and for a moment, Taiga thought Shintaro might have given up.</p><p>But then, the unmistakable opening notes of Justin Bieber’s “Baby” began blaring from the bathroom speakers.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes flew open in horror. “No, no, no!” he yelled, frantically searching for his phone to change the music. “Anything but Bieber!”</p><p>But it was too late. The pop star’s saccharine vocals filled the room, assaulting Taiga’s eardrums with lyrics about being his “baby, baby, baby.”</p><p>“Shin, you monster!” Taiga cried out, trying in vain to drown out the music with the rush of the shower. “I’ll get out, just turn it off!”</p><p>From the other side of the door, Taiga could hear Shintaro’s muffled laughter. “That’s what I thought,” his brother taunted. “Now hurry up, or I’m queueing up the ‘Despacito’ remix next!”</p><p>Taiga groaned, but he couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped his lips. Leave it to Shintaro to find the most obnoxious way to get him moving. As much as he wanted to be angry, to cling to his self-pity and sadness, Taiga found it impossible in the face of his brother’s antics. Shintaro had a way of cutting through his gloom with well-timed humor and unwavering support.</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Taiga conceded, reaching for his towel. “I’m getting out. You win, as usual.”</p><p>He could practically hear Shintaro’s smug grin through the door as the Bieber song mercifully faded away.</p><p>Taiga trudged out of the bathroom, a cloud of steam following him like a personal raincloud of misery. He found Shintaro waiting, holding out a pile of clothes with an annoyingly cheerful grin.</p><p>“No,” Taiga groaned, eyeing the oversized shirt and the swimming trunks in disdain. “I’m not going anywhere near water. My delicate skin will shrivel up like a raisin.”</p><p>Shintaro rolled his eyes. “It’s just the boat, drama queen. Now put these on before I dress you myself.”</p><p>Grumbling, Taiga snatched the clothes and retreated to the bathroom. He emerged a few minutes later, tugging at the hem of his shirt. “I look ridiculous,” he whined. “And it’s too bright out. The sun’s probably at its peak, ready to melt my retinas.”</p><p>“Here,” Shintaro said, holding out a pair of sunglasses. “Problem solved.”</p><p>Taiga squinted suspiciously at the offered eyewear. “What’s your angle here, Shin? You’re being… nice. It’s weird.”</p><p>Shintaro shrugged. “Can’t a guy just want to spend time with his brother?”</p><p>“Not when that guy is you,” Taiga retorted. “And not when this brother has a splitting headache from his pity party hangover.”</p><p>Without missing a beat, Shintaro produced a small bottle of Advil from his pocket. “Got you covered, Taiga-nii.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes narrowed further. “Okay, now I know something’s up. You’re extra prepared.”</p><p>“Just take the pills and let’s go,” Shintaro said, his patience showing the slightest signs of wear. “Unless you’d rather I start blasting my playlist again?”</p><p>Taiga winced at the memory of the Bieber assault. “God, no. Your taste in music is worse than your fashion sense.” He dry-swallowed the pills, grimacing. “Fine, let’s get this over with. But I’m not promising to enjoy myself.”</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Shintaro replied, leading the way out of the room. “Your whining is half the fun.”</span>
