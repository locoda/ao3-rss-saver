<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga thought he had it all figured out. But after his photography career fizzled out, he’s left with nothing but a camera full of failed dreams and a return ticket to his small hometown. Reuniting with his younger brother isn’t exactly what he envisioned at 27, especially since Shintaro has always been the more responsible one, a role reversal that gnaws at his pride.</p><p>Reconnecting with his roots seems like the best way to get back on track, but Taiga can’t shake that feeling that he’s somehow lost himself along the way. Enter Hokuto, a familiar face from Taiga’s past. Hokuto has changed—no longer the awkward boy he remembers, but a quietly introspective man with a kind heart.
</p><p>And Taiga can’t help but be drawn in.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Taiga lay sprawled on the tatami mat, his body a limp echo of the crumpled candy wrappers strewn around him. The ceiling fan whirred overhead, its monotonous rhythm matching the dull ache in his chest. He blinked slowly, tracing the fan’s lazy rotation with vacant eyes.</p><p>“At least you’re consistent,” he muttered to the fan. “Unlike my life.”</p><p>A snort of bitter laughter escaped his lips. He’d traded the pulsing energy of Tokyo for this—a silent room in his family’s ryokan, where the most exciting event was watching dust motes dance in the sunlight.</p><p>The irony wasn’t lost on him. He’d once chased dreams with a camera in hand, capturing moments of beauty and life.</p><p>Now, he couldn’t even muster the energy to reach for the TV remote.</p><p>Taiga’s gaze drifted to the makeshift darkroom in the corner. The equipment sat untouched, a shrine to his broken ambitions.</p><p>He’d sworn off photography, hadn’t he? So why did his fingers still itch for the familiar weight of a camera?</p><p>“Because you’re a glutton for punishment,” he answered himself, reaching for another piece of candy. The wrapper crinkled loudly in the quiet room as he unwrapped it, the sound grating on his nerves.</p><p>He popped the candy in his mouth, letting the sweetness flood his taste buds. It was a poor substitute for the rush of creativity he used to feel, but it was something.</p><p>Anything to fill the void that failure had left behind.</p><p>The fan continued its endless rotation, and Taiga found a perverse comfort in its constancy. It didn’t judge. It didn’t have expectations.</p><p>It just… was.</p><p>Unlike the TV, with its parade of successful people living their best lives, the fan didn’t mock him with false promises of a better tomorrow.</p><p>“At least you’re honest,” Taiga mumbled, raising a half-hearted toast with an empty candy wrapper. “You spin in circles, going nowhere. Just like me.”</p><p>The door slid open with a soft thud, breaking the monotony of Taiga’s self-imposed isolation. Shintaro’s stocky silhouette filled the doorway, his broad shoulders blocking what little light filtered in from the hallway.”</p><p>“Jesus, Taiga-nii, don’t you look pathetic,” Shintaro remarked, his tone a mix of exasperation and concern.</p><p>Taiga didn’t bother to lift his head. “Thanks for the ego boost, little brother. Really needed that today.”</p><p>Shintaro’s footsteps padded across the tatami, crinkling candy wrappers as he approached. “This is getting ridiculous, nii-chan. You can’t keep wallowing like this.”</p><p>“Watch me,” Taiga muttered, but there was no real fight in his voice.</p><p>Without warning, Shintaro strode to the window. His hand grasped the curtain, and with one swift motion, he yanked it open.</p><p>“No!” Taiga yelped, throwing an arm over his eyes as sunlight flooded the room. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Letting some life back into this cave you call a room,” Shintaro replied, undeterred.</p><p>Taiga hissed dramatically, curling into a ball on the floor. “I’m melting! Melting! Oh, what a world!”</p><p>Shintaro snorted. “You’re not the fucking Wicked Witch of the West, Taiga-nii.”</p><p>“No,” Taiga agreed, peeking through his fingers. “I’m obviously a vampire. Defeated by the cruel light of day, courtesy of my traitorous brother. It’s probably part of some overly complicated plot involving ancient prophecies and brooding immortals with questionable fashion sense.”</p><p>“Right,” Shintaro drawled. “And I suppose those candy wrappers are actually the ashes of your victims?”</p><p>Taiga considered for a moment. “They could be. Victims of my poor life choices, at least.”</p><p>Shintaro crouched down, peering at Taiga’s face. “Speaking of poor life choices, you’ve got chocolate all over your face. And when’s the last time you showered? You smell like a locker room after a sumo tournament.”</p><p>Taiga scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. “Please. My natural musk is a delicate bouquet of masculinity. I’ll have you know I can go weeks without deodorant before anyone notices.”</p><p>“Really?” Shintaro raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>Taiga hesitated, then surreptitiously lifted an arm to sniff. His nose wrinkled involuntarily. “Shit, okay, maybe you have a point,” he conceded grudgingly.</p><p>“Thought so,” Shintaro said, a hint of smugness in his voice. He stood up, offering a hand to Taiga. “Come on, time to rejoin the land of the living. And the bathing.”</p><p>Taiga stared at the offered hand for a moment before reluctantly taking it. As Shintaro pulled him to his feet, Taiga felt a pang of… something. Gratitude? Shame?</p><p>It was hard to pin down.</p><p>“When did you become such a responsible adult?” Taiga grumbled, but there was no real heat in his words.</p><p>Shintaro shrugged. “Someone had to step up while you were off chasing your dreams in Tokyo.”</p><p>The words could have been accusatory, but Shintaro’s tone was gentle.</p><p>Still, Taiga felt the weight of them, a reminder of the expectations he’d failed to meet.</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Taiga mumbled, running a hand through his greasy hair, “looks like those dreams crashed and burned. Now you’re stuck babysitting your failure of an older brother.”</p><p>“Hey,” Shintaro said firmly, gripping Taiga’s shoulder. “You’re not a failure. You’re just… figuring things out. And I’m here to help, whether you like it or not.”</p><p>Taiga met his brother’s gaze, seeing the sincerity there. It was almost too much to bear. “Even if that means dragging me kicking and screaming into basic hygiene?”</p><p>“Especially then,” Shintaro nodded solemnly. “Now, go take a shower before I have to hose you down myself. I’ve given you two whole days to pout, but now it’s time to rejoin the world of the living.”</p><p>Taiga bristled at the accusation. “I’m not pouting,” he protested, his voice rising an octave. “This is dignified self-reflection.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Shintaro nodded, unconvinced. He pointed at Taiga’s face. “And I suppose that jutting lower lip is just part of your ‘dignified’ expression?”</p><p>“Fine,” he grumbled, “maybe I’m wallowing a little. But I’ve earned it, don’t you think? My dreams just went up in smoke.”</p><p>Shintaro’s face softened slightly. “I get it, Taiga-nii. But you can’t stay in this room forever, surrounded by candy wrappers and self-pity.” He extended his hand once more. “Come on. Let’s start small. A shower, some fresh air. Maybe even actual human interaction that doesn’t involve me nagging you.”</p><p>Taiga eyed the offered hand, torn between his desire to stay curled up in his cocoon of misery and the growing realization that Shintaro might have a point.</p><p>His bladder chose that moment to remind him of more pressing concerns.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Taiga relented, grasping Shintaro’s hand. “But only because I need to use the bathroom. Not because you’re right or anything.”</p><p>As Shintaro pulled him to his feet, Taiga felt a twinge of guilt. He knew, deep down, that his brother was right. The past two days of self-imposed exile hadn’t made him feel any better about his situation. If anything, they’d just given him more time to replay his failures on a loop in his head.</p><p>“There,” Shintaro said, clapping Taiga on the shoulder. “Was that so hard?”</p><p>“Yes,” Taiga replied automatically, but there was less conviction in his voice than before. “Absolutely traumatic. I may never recover.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Two days ago, Taiga’s life in Tokyo had finally crumbled beyond repair. The city that had once seemed full of promise and opportunity had become a labyrinth of disappointment and failure.</p><p>With trembling hands and a lump in his throat, he’d dialed Shintaro’s number, swallowing his pride with each ring.</p><p>“Shin?” Taiga had said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I… I need help.”</p><p>Shintaro hadn’t hesitated. “I’m on my way,” he’d replied, no questions asked.</p><p>The next day, Shintaro had arrived in Tokyo, stepping off the plane with a determined set to his shoulders. He’d found Taiga in his cramped apartment, surrounded by the remnants of his shattered dreams—half-finished photo projects, rejected portfolio submissions, and past-due bills.</p><p>Taiga had expected judgment, maybe even a lecture about responsibility and planning.</p><p>Instead, Shintaro had simply rolled up his sleeves and started packing boxes. “Let’s get you home,” he’d said, his voice gentle but firm.</p><p>They’d spent the day dismantling Taiga’s life in Tokyo. Each item packed away felt like an admission of defeat, but Shintaro’s steady presence had made it bearable. His little brother, who had never fully understood Taiga’s need to leave Kumamoto, was now the one bringing him back.</p><p>The plane ride back to Kumamoto had been quiet. Shintaro had let him brood, offering silent support in the form of a strong shoulder to lean on when exhaustion finally overtook Taiga.</p><p>When they’d arrived in Kumamoto, the familiar sights and smells had hit Taiga like a punch to the gut. This was what he’d run from, what he’d been so sure he’d outgrown.</p><p>Now, tail between his legs, he was crawling back.</p><p>Shintaro had helped him settle into his old room at the ryokan, unpacking the essentials and leaving the rest for later. He’d been patient, allowing Taiga space to process his return.</p><p>But now, two days later, it seemed Shintaro had decided that enough was enough. It was time for Taiga to face the music.</p><p>And apparently, a much-needed shower.</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro wrinkled his nose as he gave Taiga a once-over. “Okay, first things first. You need a shower. And then put on something casual but nice.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, confusion momentarily overriding his self-pity. “Why? What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s a secret,” Shintaro replied, a hint of mischief in his eyes.</p><p>“A secret?” Taiga groaned. “No, no secrets. No surprises. Just let me wallow in peace. I want to order some greasy takeout and hide under my covers until… I don’t know, next year? Maybe the year after?”</p><p>Shintaro shook his head, undeterred. “Not happening, big brother. You’ve had your pity party. Now it’s time to rejoin the land of the living.”</p><p>“But—" Taiga started to protest, but Shintaro was already moving. With surprising strength, he began physically steering Taiga toward the bathroom.</p><p>“No buts,” Shintaro insisted, his hands firmly on Taiga’s shoulders. “Shower. Clothes. Out. In that order.”</p><p>Taiga dug in his heels, trying to resist. “Come on, Shin. I’m not ready for… whatever this is. Can’t we just stay in? I promise I’ll shower tomorrow.”</p><p>“Nope,” Shintaro said, popping the ‘p’ sound. He gave Taiga another push. “You’re not getting out of this. Trust me, okay?”</p><p>Taiga stumbled forward, his protests dying on his lips as he saw the determined look in Shintaro’s eyes. He knew that look. It was the same one Shintaro got when he was learning how to balance the ryokan’s books or dealing with difficult customers. There was no arguing with him when he was like this.</p><p>“Fine,” Taiga sighed, shoulders slumping in defeat. “But if this turns out to be some kind of intervention or surprise party, I’m disowning you as my brother.”</p><p>Shintaro, clearly not trusting Taiga to follow through, trailed him to the <em>en suite</em> bathroom. As Taiga leaned against the doorframe, Shintaro bustled past him, turning on the shower with practiced efficiency.</p><p>“You know, I am capable of bathing myself,” Taiga grumbled, watching as his younger brother adjusted the water temperature. “Been doing it for years now.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Shintaro replied, unconvinced. He reached for a fresh towel, setting it on the counter within easy reach. “And yet, here we are.”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, but a small part of him appreciated Shintaro’s care, even if he’d never admit it out loud. As steam began to fill the bathroom, Taiga tried another tactic.</p><p>“Wait a second,” he said, frowning. “Aren’t you skipping work for this? What about your assistant manager duties?”</p><p>Shintaro paused, giving Taiga a strange look. “Taiga-nii, it’s Sunday. I can afford a day off.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, genuinely surprised. “Sunday? But… I could’ve sworn it was Wednesday.”</p><p>“Nope,” Shintaro said, shaking his head. “You’ve been holed up in here since Friday night. It’s definitely Sunday.”</p><p>The realization hit Taiga like a bucket of cold water. He’d lost track of time completely, days blurring together in his cocoon of misery. The thought was sobering, and a little frightening.</p><p>“Oh,” was all he could manage, suddenly feeling very small.</p><p>Shintaro’s expression softened, understanding dawning in his eyes. He stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Taiga’s shoulder. “Hey, it’s okay. That’s why I’m here, alright? To help you get back on track.”</p><p>Taiga felt a lump form in his throat. “Thanks, Shin,” he said softly, the sincerity in his voice surprising even himself. “For picking me up. For always rescuing me.”</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a memory flashed through Taiga's mind. It was five years ago, just before he’d left for Tokyo. Shintaro had come to his rescue then too, though under very different circumstances.</p><p>Taiga had been dating Ryota, a charming but volatile man who worked as a bartender in downtown Kumamoto. At first, it had been exciting — Ryota was passionate, spontaneous, everything Taiga thought he wanted. But as the months wore on, Ryota’s passion turned to possessiveness, his spontaneity to unpredictability.</p><p>One night, after a particularly heated argument, Ryota had raised his hand, stopping just short of striking Taiga. The look in his eyes had been enough to send Taiga running, straight to Shintaro’s room at the ryokan.</p><p>Shintaro hadn’t asked questions. He’d simply held Taiga as he cried, then calmly walked to Ryota’s apartment the next day to end things on Taiga’s behalf.</p><p>When he returned, his knuckles were bruised, but he just shrugged and said, “It’s taken care of.”</p><p>It was in the aftermath of that incident that Taiga had decided to move to Tokyo. He wanted to prove — to himself, to Shintaro, to everyone — that he could stand on his own two feet. That he could achieve his dreams of becoming a renowned photographer without needing to be rescued.</p><p>But Tokyo had been a harsh teacher. The city’s relentless pace and sky-high living costs had quickly eaten away at his meager resources. Without the safety net of nearby family, every setback felt magnified, every struggle more isolating.</p><p>He’d tried, god knows he’d tried. Freelance photography gigs came sporadically, feast or famine with no middle ground. One month he’d be flush with cash from a lucrative wedding shoot, the next scraping by on instant ramen and convenience store coffee.</p><p>His part-time job at a small diner in Shibuya had provided some stability, but between rent, utilities, and the constant need to upgrade his camera equipment, it was never quite enough.</p><p>Taiga closed his eyes as he stands in the steamy bathroom, remembering the countless nights he’d sat at his tiny kitchen table, staring at bills and bank statements, trying to make the numbers add up. He’d taken on more shifts at the diner, sacrificed sleep for late-night editing sessions, even considered selling some of his beloved camera lenses.</p><p>But in the end, it hadn’t been enough to keep him financially afloat in the unforgiving sea of Tokyo’s economy.</p><p>The cascade of events that led to Taiga’s current predicament played out in his mind like a cruel slideshow. It had started when his roommate, Kenji, announced his engagement.</p><p>Initially, Taiga had been happy for his friend, but that joy quickly turned to panic when Kenji revealed he’d be moving out to live with his fiancée.</p><p>Suddenly, Taiga found himself solely responsible for the rent on their modest two-bedroom apartment. He’d tried to make it work, picking up extra shifts at the diner and taking on any photography gig he could find, no matter how small.</p><p>But it wasn’t enough. The rent payments started coming in late, then incomplete, and finally not at all.</p><p>As if the universe was conspiring against him, it was during this financial spiral that Taiga had his last photo exhibit. He’d poured everything into it — his savings, his time, his heart. The series, a stark exploration of urban isolation, was supposed to be his breakthrough moment.</p><p>Instead, it had been a disaster. The reviews were brutal, tearing apart his technique, his vision, his very worth as an artist.</p><p>One particularly scathing critique still echoed in his mind: “Kyomoto’s work is as empty and soulless as the city he attempts to capture.”</p><p>The final blow came in the form of an eviction notice, taped unceremoniously to his apartment door. Taiga had stared at it for what felt like hours, the harsh reality of his situation finally sinking in.</p><p>With trembling hands, he’d reached for his phone and called the one person he knew would always answer: Shintaro.</p><p>Shintaro’s voice cut through Taiga's reverie. “Alright, enough stalling. Get in the shower already. And don’t take too long, we’ve got places to be.” With that, he stepped out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Taiga stared at the closed door for a moment, a small spark of defiance igniting in his chest. If Shintaro wanted him to hurry, well… he’d do the opposite.</p><p>Taiga reached for his phone, scrolling through his playlists. With a few taps on his phone, his carefully curated “Sad Songs for Sad Times” playlist began to fill the steamy bathroom through the speakers. The melancholic notes of Sufjan Stevens’ “Fourth of July” enveloped him, fueling his desire for a good, old-fashioned wallow.</p><p>Stripping off his days-old clothes, he stepped into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over him. As the first melancholic notes filled the steamy air, Taiga closed his eyes, fully prepared to wallow for as long as possible.</p><p>Still, as the droplets cascaded over his body, he felt a small weight lift from his shoulders. Shintaro was right, as usual – a shower was exactly what he needed.</p><p>“This is perfect,” Taiga muttered to himself, grabbing the shampoo bottle. “A nice, long shower to match my nice, long pity party.”</p><p>He lathered up his hair, letting the suds drip down his face like soapy tears. “Yeah, that’s the stuff,” he mumbled, leaning his head back to let the water rinse away the bubbles.</p><p>As the next song, a haunting ballad by Bon Iver, began to play, Taiga felt himself slipping deeper into his melancholy. He closed his eyes, picturing himself as the tragic hero of his own indie film, doomed to a life of misunderstood artistic struggle.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud bang on the bathroom door jolted Taiga from his reverie.</p><p>“Hey!” Shintaro’s voice called out, muffled but insistent. “You better not be using up all the hot water with your emo shower routine!”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes, though a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Trust Shintaro to rain on his pity parade. “I’m just getting started!” he shouted back, reaching for the conditioner. “You’ll have to pry me out of here when I’m good and pruney!”</p><p>There was a pause, and for a moment, Taiga thought Shintaro might have given up.</p><p>But then, the unmistakable opening notes of Justin Bieber’s “Baby” began blaring from the bathroom speakers.</p><p>Taiga’s eyes flew open in horror. “No, no, no!” he yelled, frantically searching for his phone to change the music. “Anything but Bieber!”</p><p>But it was too late. The pop star’s saccharine vocals filled the room, assaulting Taiga’s eardrums with lyrics about being his “baby, baby, baby.”</p><p>“Shin, you monster!” Taiga cried out, trying in vain to drown out the music with the rush of the shower. “I’ll get out, just turn it off!”</p><p>From the other side of the door, Taiga could hear Shintaro’s muffled laughter. “That’s what I thought,” his brother taunted. “Now hurry up, or I’m queueing up the ‘Despacito’ remix next!”</p><p>Taiga groaned, but he couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped his lips. Leave it to Shintaro to find the most obnoxious way to get him moving. As much as he wanted to be angry, to cling to his self-pity and sadness, Taiga found it impossible in the face of his brother’s antics. Shintaro had a way of cutting through his gloom with well-timed humor and unwavering support.</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Taiga conceded, reaching for his towel. “I’m getting out. You win, as usual.”</p><p>He could practically hear Shintaro’s smug grin through the door as the Bieber song mercifully faded away.</p><p>Taiga trudged out of the bathroom, a cloud of steam following him like a personal raincloud of misery. He found Shintaro waiting, holding out a pile of clothes with an annoyingly cheerful grin.</p><p>“No,” Taiga groaned, eyeing the oversized shirt and the swimming trunks in disdain. “I’m not going anywhere near water. My delicate skin will shrivel up like a raisin.”</p><p>Shintaro rolled his eyes. “It’s just the boat, drama queen. Now put these on before I dress you myself.”</p><p>Grumbling, Taiga snatched the clothes and retreated to the bathroom. He emerged a few minutes later, tugging at the hem of his shirt. “I look ridiculous,” he whined. “And it’s too bright out. The sun’s probably at its peak, ready to melt my retinas.”</p><p>“Here,” Shintaro said, holding out a pair of sunglasses. “Problem solved.”</p><p>Taiga squinted suspiciously at the offered eyewear. “What’s your angle here, Shin? You’re being… nice. It’s weird.”</p><p>Shintaro shrugged. “Can’t a guy just want to spend time with his brother?”</p><p>“Not when that guy is you,” Taiga retorted. “And not when this brother has a splitting headache from his pity party hangover.”</p><p>Without missing a beat, Shintaro produced a small bottle of Advil from his pocket. “Got you covered, Taiga-nii.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes narrowed further. “Okay, now I know something’s up. You’re extra prepared.”</p><p>“Just take the pills and let’s go,” Shintaro said, his patience showing the slightest signs of wear. “Unless you’d rather I start blasting my playlist again?”</p><p>Taiga winced at the memory of the Bieber assault. “God, no. Your taste in music is worse than your fashion sense.” He dry-swallowed the pills, grimacing. “Fine, let’s get this over with. But I’m not promising to enjoy myself.”</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Shintaro replied, leading the way out of the room. “Your whining is half the fun.”</span>

<p>Taiga shuffled after Shintaro, his feet dragging like they were encased in concrete. The sunglasses perched on his nose did little to improve his mood, but at least they shielded his eyes from the offensive brightness of the world. He clutched his phone like a lifeline, already plotting his escape into its digital embrace the moment he got a chance.</p><p>“Wait,” Shintaro said, pausing at the top of the stairs. “We should let Mom and Dad know we’re heading out.”</p><p>Taiga’s stomach dropped. “Hard pass,” he muttered, taking a step back. “I’m not ready for the disappointment parade.”</p><p>Shintaro’s brow furrowed. “You haven’t talked to them since you got back?”</p><p>“Not much, and I’d like to keep it that way,” Taiga replied, trying to edge past his brother. “Let’s just go.”</p><p>But Shintaro was quicker, his hand shooting out to grab Taiga’s arm. “Oh no, you don’t. They’re worried about you.”</p><p>Before Taiga could protest further, Shintaro yanked him toward the living room. Taiga’s feet scrambled for purchase on the polished wood floor, but it was useless. His little brother had always been the stronger one.</p><p>“Shin, I swear to god—” Taiga hissed.</p><p>But it was too late. Shintaro slid open the living room door, revealing their parents seated at the low table.</p><p>Hiromi looked up, her eyes widening in surprise. Masaki’s gaze, sharp and assessing, locked onto Taiga like a heat-seeking missile.</p><p>Taiga felt his throat constrict. He wanted to bolt, to hide in his room and never come out. But Shintaro’s grip was firm, anchoring him in place.</p><p>“Look who I found,” Shintaro announced, his cheerful tone at odds with the vice-like grip on Taiga’s arm. “We’re heading out for a bit, thought you’d want to know.”</p><p>Taiga stumbled into the living room, feeling like a deer caught in headlights. The familiar scent of tatami and green tea wafted through the air, a nostalgic blend that only intensified his discomfort. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the softer light filtering through the shoji screens.</p><p>Masaki sat cross-legged on a zabuton, his back straight as a rod. The newspaper rustled as he lowered it, his piercing gaze settling on Taiga over the rim of his teacup.</p><p>Across from him, Hiromi and Aoi huddled over a scatter of papers, their heads bent in concentration. At Shintaro’s announcement, they looked up in unison, their expressions a mix of surprise and warmth.</p><p>“Taiga!” Hiromi’s face lit up, her smile as gentle as ever. “It’s so good to see you up and about.”</p><p>Aoi nodded, her pixie-cut hair bouncing slightly. “Good morning, Taiga-san,” she said, her voice soft but clear.</p><p>Taiga’s gaze skittered away from them, landing on the ikebana arrangement in the corner. Anywhere but their faces, which he was sure held a tinge of pity beneath their smiles.</p><p>“Well, well.” Masaki’s dry voice cut through the air like a knife. “Look who’s finally decided to join the land of the living.”</p><p>Heat crept up Taiga’s neck, settling in his cheeks. He wanted nothing more than to melt into the tatami floor and disappear.</p><p>Instead, he forced himself to meet his father’s gaze, mustering up a weak smile that felt more like a grimace. “Yeah, well,” he mumbled, shoving his hands deep into his pockets. “Shintaro insisted.”</p><p>Masaki’s eyebrow arched, a hint of amusement playing at the corners of his mouth. “Did he now? And here I thought you were content to spend the rest of your days as a human-sized dust bunny.”</p><p>Taiga winced, the words hitting a little too close to home. He opened his mouth, a retort on the tip of his tongue, but nothing came out. What could he say? His father wasn’t wrong.</p><p>Shintaro’s hand squeezed Taiga’s shoulder, a silent command to stay put. “We’re heading out to the boat,” he explained, his voice steady and sure.</p><p>Taiga’s gaze drifted to the floor, tracing the patterns in the tatami. He could feel his father’s eyes boring into him, searching for... what? Remorse? Determination?</p><p>Whatever it was, Taiga was sure he’d come up short.</p><p>“Aoi.” Shintaro’s voice softened, drawing Taiga’s attention. He glanced up to see his brother looking at Aoi, his expression gentle. “Would you like to join us?”</p><p>Aoi’s eyes widened, a hint of hesitation crossing her face as she turned to Hiromi. But before she could speak, Hiromi waved her hand dismissively.</p><p>“Go on, dear,” Hiromi insisted, her smile warm. “I can manage here.”</p><p>Aoi’s face lit up, and she nodded, rising gracefully to her feet. “I’ll just go change,” she said, squeezing Shintaro’s hand as she passed.</p><p>As Aoi left the room, a memory hit Taiga like a sucker punch to the gut. Last May, his phone ringing in his dingy Tokyo apartment, Shintaro’s voice on the other end, excited and nervous all at once.</p><p>“I’m engaged, Taiga-nii!” Shintaro had said, the words hanging in the air between them.</p><p>Taiga had felt like the world’s biggest asshole, guilt washing over him as he realized he couldn’t even remember Shintaro mentioning he was dating someone. He’d fumbled through congratulations, promising to visit soon, knowing even then it was a lie.</p><p>Now, watching Shintaro’s eyes follow Aoi out of the room, that same guilt gnawed at Taiga’s insides. His little brother, getting married. It still didn’t feel real, like some bizarre parallel universe where Shintaro had somehow leap-frogged ahead in life while Taiga was stuck in neutral.</p><p>He shook his head, trying to dislodge the thought. This day was already shaping up to be a nightmare, and they hadn’t even left the house yet.</p><p>Hiromi cleared her throat, breaking the awkward silence that had settled over the room. “Taiga, why don’t you sit down for a moment?” She patted the zabuton next to her, her smile warm and inviting.</p><p>Taiga hesitated, but Shintaro gave him a gentle push. With a sigh, he shuffled over and sank onto the cushion, his legs folding underneath him. His eyes wandered to the papers scattered across the table, curiosity momentarily overriding his discomfort.</p><p>Colorful sketches of flower arrangements caught his attention, each one more intricate than the last. He recognized the style immediately – these were designs for Gonzaemon no Yu’s annual Christmas event. The memory of past years’ celebrations flickered through his mind, a bittersweet reminder of simpler times.</p><p>“You’re right,” Hiromi said, noticing his gaze. “We’re planning this year’s Christmas decorations.” She paused, her fingers tracing the edge of one sketch. “Actually, Taiga, I was wondering... Would you be interested in taking some photos for the ryokan? The website could use some new promotional images, and you always did such a wonderful job in the past.”</p><p>Taiga felt his stomach twist. In the past, he would have jumped at the chance, eager to prove himself and add to his portfolio.</p><p>But now... The thought of picking up a camera made his palms sweat. What if he couldn’t capture the beauty of the ryokan anymore? What if his failure in Tokyo had somehow stripped him of his talent?</p><p>He opened his mouth, but no words came out.</p><p>His hesitation must have shown on his face because Hiromi’s expression softened. “Oh, don’t worry about it,” she said quickly, waving her hand dismissively. “I’m sure we can find another photographer. It was just a thought.”</p><p>“I... I’ll think about it,” he mumbled, unable to meet her gaze.</p><p>Taiga felt the weight of his father’s gaze settle on him, heavy as a stone. He glanced up, meeting Masaki’s eyes for a brief moment before looking away again. The silence stretched between them, taut as a bowstring.</p><p>“So, Taiga,” Masaki said, his voice carefully neutral as he set down his newspaper. “Have you given any thought to your plans now that you’re back from Tokyo?”</p><p>Taiga’s stomach twisted. He'd spent the last two days holed up in his room, alternating between self-pity and mindless scrolling on his phone. The thought of actually planning for the future hadn’t even crossed his mind.</p><p>“I... uh...” Taiga stammered, heat creeping up his neck. “Not really, no.”</p><p>He braced himself for the lecture, the disappointment, but Masaki’s face remained impassive.</p><p>“I see,” Masaki said, taking a sip of his tea. “Well, you’re welcome here at the ryokan, of course. But I’d prefer if you started helping out around the ryokan.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, caught off guard. He’d expected… well, he wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but it wasn’t this calm suggestion. “Help out?” he echoed, his mind racing. The idea of working at the ryokan, of facing guests and their expectations, made his palms sweat.</p><p>But he knew he couldn’t freeload off his parents forever. And a job, <em>any job</em>, was better than rotting in his room for days on end, wondering what could have been.</p><p>Taiga swallowed hard, nodding slowly. “Yeah, okay. I can do that.”</p><p>Masaki's eyebrows raised slightly, as if he hadn't expected Taiga to agree so easily. “Good,” he said, a hint of approval in his voice. “We’ll discuss the details later. For now, go enjoy your outing with Shintaro.”</p><p>As Taiga stood, relief and anxiety warred in his chest. A job, even one he wasn’t thrilled about, was better than the limbo he’d been floating in.</p><p>At least it was something to do, something to focus on besides his own failures.</p><p>The soft padding of feet announced Aoi’s return. Taiga turned to see her step into the room, now dressed in a matching crochet shirt and shorts set that hinted at the bikini underneath. He couldn’t help but notice the way Shintaro’s eyes lit up, his gaze traveling appreciatively over his fiancée.</p><p>Shintaro moved to Aoi’s side, their hands finding each other with practiced ease. “We’re heading out now,” he said, addressing their parents. “We’ll be back later.”</p><p>As they made their way through the ryokan’s winding hallways, Taiga trailed behind the couple, feeling distinctly out of place. He watched as Shintaro and Aoi exchanged soft glances and quiet words, their fingers intertwined. The staff they passed bowed and greeted them warmly, their smiles genuine and familiar.</p><p>“Good morning, Shintaro-san, Aoi-san,” a young attendant called out, her eyes darting curiously to Taiga before quickly looking away.</p><p>Taiga hunched his shoulders, acutely aware of the whispers that would undoubtedly follow in their wake. The prodigal son returns, tail between his legs.</p><p>They reached Shintaro’s car, a modest sedan that gleamed in the morning sun. As Taiga slid into the backseat, a wave of self-pity washed over him.</p><p>“Looks like I’m the third wheel on this little excursion,” he muttered, more to himself than to the couple in front.</p><p>Shintaro caught his eye in the rearview mirror as he started the engine. A knowing smile played at the corners of his mouth. “Don’t worry, Taiga-nii,” he said, his tone light but holding a hint of something Taiga couldn't quite place. “We're making one more stop before we head to the boat.”</p><p>Taiga’s brow furrowed in confusion. “What? Who else is coming?”</p><p>Shintaro’s smile widened. “Hokuto,” he said simply, turning his attention to the road as he pulled out of the parking area.</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----</p><p> </p><p>Taiga leaned his head against the cool glass of the car window, watching as the familiar countryside rolled by. Fields of green stretched out to meet the horizon, dotted with the occasional cluster of houses or a lone tree standing sentinel. It was a view he’d seen countless times before, yet now it felt almost foreign, like a postcard from someone else’s life.</p><p>In the front seat, Shintaro and Aoi’s voices washed over him in a gentle murmur. Their conversation drifted back to him in fragments.</p><p>“… thinking maybe light pink for the bridesmaids’ dresses?” Aoi was saying, her voice soft but animated.</p><p>Shintaro hummed in agreement. “That would look nice with the cherry blossoms, if they’re still blooming in May.”</p><p>“Oh, I hope so,” Aoi sighed dreamily. “It would be so beautiful for the photos.”</p><p>Taiga felt a twinge in his chest. He slouched lower in his seat, feeling like an intruder in an intimate moment. The easy back-and-forth between Shintaro and Aoi only highlighted how out of place he felt, how disconnected he’d become from his family’s life.</p><p>“What do you think, Taiga-san?”</p><p>Aoi’s voice, directed at him this time, startled Taiga out of his brooding. He blinked, realizing he'd completely lost track of the conversation.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” he asked, straightening up.</p><p>Aoi turned in her seat, offering him a kind smile. “About the cherry blossoms for the wedding. Do you think they’ll still be blooming in May?”</p><p>“Oh, uh...” Taiga fumbled, caught off guard by her attempt to include him. “Yeah, probably. They usually last pretty late into spring around here.”</p><p>Aoi’s smile widened. “That’s good to hear. I was hoping you might have some insight, given your experience with photography.”</p><p>A wave of gratitude washed over Taiga. He made a mental note to make more of an effort to get to know Aoi. He realized with a pang of guilt that he knew next to nothing about her, beyond the fact that she worked in customer service at the ryokan.</p><p>Here she was, about to become his sister-in-law, and she was practically a stranger to him.</p><p>Taiga watched as the familiar landmarks of his childhood slipped by outside the car window. The old convenience store where they used to buy popsicles on hot summer days, the park where they’d spent countless hours playing soccer, the winding road that led up to their favorite lookout point. Each sight stirred a mix of nostalgia and unease in his chest.</p><p>As they turned onto the street leading to Hokuto’s house, Taiga found himself wondering about his old friend. He realized with a start that he knew almost nothing about Hokuto’s life now.</p><p>“Hey, Shin,” Taiga said, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled in the car. “What’s Hokuto been up to these days?”</p><p>Shintaro glanced at him in the rearview mirror. “Oh, he’s been doing well. He’s working at a travel agency in town. Actually, we’ve been collaborating quite a bit lately.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “A travel agency? Really?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Shintaro nodded. “He’s been helping us promote the ryokan to tourists. He’s got a real knack for marketing, believe it or not.”</p><p>Taiga leaned back, trying to reconcile this new information with his memories of Hokuto. He remembered a quiet, bookish boy who always had his nose buried in a novel or a textbook.</p><p>“Huh,” Taiga mused aloud. “I always imagined Hokuto would end up working in a library or something. You know, surrounded by books.”</p><p>Shintaro chuckled. “People change, Taiga-nii. Hokuto’s still a big reader, but he’s found a way to combine that with his love for Kumamoto. You should see some of the campaigns he’s come up with for the ryokan. They’re really impressive.”</p><p>Taiga felt a twinge of something he couldn’t quite name. Pride for his friend’s success? Envy that Hokuto had found his path while Taiga was still floundering?</p><p>Or maybe just a sense of disconnect, realizing how much he’d missed while he was away chasing his own dreams in Tokyo.</p><p>As the car wound its way through the familiar streets, Taiga’s mind drifted back to his childhood days with Shintaro and Hokuto. A kaleidoscope of memories flickered through his mind, each one tinged with the warm glow of nostalgia.</p><p>He remembered countless summer afternoons spent exploring the woods behind their houses, Taiga always in the lead, with Shintaro close behind and Hokuto trailing after them, his quiet voice a constant reminder to be careful. Taiga could almost hear Hokuto’s worried tone, “Maybe we shouldn’t go too far…” even as they pushed deeper into the forest.</p><p>There was the time they’d snuck into the abandoned house at the edge of town, ignoring the “No Trespassing” signs. Taiga had been determined to capture the eerie beauty of the decaying building, while Shintaro egged him on.</p><p>It was Hokuto who’d finally convinced them to leave, his eyes darting nervously to the setting sun.</p><p>But the memory that stood out most vividly was from when they were sixteen. Taiga had climbed an old oak tree, camera in hand, determined to get the perfect shot of the sunset. He’d inched out onto a branch, ignoring Hokuto’s anxious warnings from below.</p><p>“Taiga, please be careful! That branch doesn’t look stable,” Hokuto had called up, his face a mask of concern.</p><p>Taiga had just grinned down at him. “Don’t worry so much, Hokku! I’ve got this—”</p><p>And then, with a sickening crack, the branch had given way.</p><p>Taiga remembered the heart-stopping moment of freefall, the world spinning around him. But instead of hitting the hard ground, he’d landed on something softer.</p><p>Hokuto.</p><p>In his attempt to catch Taiga, Hokuto had broken his arm. The pain must have been excruciating, but Taiga remembered how Hokuto had simply looked up at him, relief flooding his features.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Hokuto had asked, his voice strained but gentle.</p><p>Taiga had been stunned by Hokuto’s selflessness. Even with his arm bent at an unnatural angle, Hokuto’s first concern had been for Taiga’s safety.</p><p>In the days that followed, Taiga had been consumed with guilt. He’d visited Hokuto every day, bringing him books and snacks, trying to make up for his recklessness. But Hokuto, true to form, had been endlessly forgiving.</p><p>As the car neared Hokuto’s house, Taiga’s mind drifted to the night before he left for Tokyo. The memory washed over him, as vivid as if it had happened yesterday.</p><p>He and Hokuto had sat side by side on the ryokan’s balcony, their legs dangling over the edge. The night air was cool, carrying the scent of pine and distant hot springs. Before them, the mountains loomed, their silhouettes dark against the star-studded sky.</p><p>Taiga remembered the electricity in his veins, the excitement of his impending departure mingling with a bittersweet sadness. He’d been so ready to leave, to chase his dreams in the big city.</p><p>But sitting there with Hokuto, he’d felt a momentary pang of doubt.</p><p>Hokuto had been uncharacteristically quiet that night. Taiga recalled glancing at his friend, noticing the way Hokuto’s brow furrowed, his lips parted as if on the verge of speech.</p><p>But whatever Hokuto had wanted to say remained unspoken.</p><p>Instead, Hokuto had reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, wrapped package. “Here,” he’d said, his voice soft. “I got you something.”</p><p>Taiga had unwrapped it to find a camera strap, beautifully crafted with intricate patterns woven into the fabric. It was practical yet personal, perfectly encapsulating their friendship.</p><p>“Hokku,” Taiga had breathed, running his fingers over the strap. “It’s perfect. Thank you.”</p><p>Hokuto had smiled, a gentle, almost sad curve of his lips. “I thought… well, I wanted you to have something to remember us by. To remember home.”</p><p>Taiga had used that camera strap religiously in Tokyo. It had been a constant companion, a piece of home that he carried with him through every shoot, every failure, every small victory.</p><p>Now, it lay buried in one of the boxes he'd brought back from Tokyo, a painful reminder of his shattered dreams.</p><p>As the car turned onto Hokuto’s street, Taiga felt a lump form in his throat. That camera strap, once a symbol of his aspirations, now felt like a mockery of his failure. He’d left Kumamoto full of hope and ambition, and he’d returned with nothing but a box of memories and a heart heavy with disappointment.</p><p>Taiga's heart rate picked up as they pulled into Hokuto’s driveway. The house before them was a traditional home, its wooden exterior weathered but well-maintained. It looked exactly as Taiga remembered it.</p><p>Shintaro killed the engine and pulled out his phone. “I’ll let Hokuto know we're here,” he said, his fingers tapping out a quick message.</p><p>Taiga nodded, his mouth suddenly dry. He stared at the front door, trying to picture the Hokuto he remembered—a shy, mousy-looking teenager with a perpetual book in hand.</p><p>But that image felt outdated, a relic from a time that seemed impossibly distant now.</p><p>What would Hokuto look like now? Taiga wondered. Would he still have that same hesitant smile, those gentle eyes that always seemed to be observing everything around him? Or had time changed him as much as it had changed Taiga?</p><p>More pressing than Hokuto’s appearance, though, was the question of how he would react to seeing Taiga again. The guilt of neglected friendship sat heavy in Taiga’s stomach. He’d been so caught up in his life in Tokyo, his struggles and fleeting successes, that he’d let their connection fade to sporadic texts and occasional likes on social media posts.</p><p>Would there be awkwardness between them now? Would Hokuto be disappointed in him for not keeping in touch?</p><p>Or worse, would he be indifferent, their once-close friendship reduced to nothing more than polite small talk?</p><p>Taiga’s fingers drummed nervously against his thigh as he waited, his mind racing with possibilities. He’d faced countless challenges in Tokyo, but somehow, the prospect of reuniting with his childhood friend felt more daunting than any of them.</p><p>The front door of the house slid open, and Taiga’s breath caught in his throat. A man stepped out, and for a moment, Taiga didn’t recognize him.</p><p>He was tall, taller than Taiga remembered, with a sharp jawline that caught the afternoon light. His black hair fell in gentle waves, framing a face that was both familiar and startlingly new.</p><p>But then Taiga’s eyes caught on a detail he knew as well as his own reflection — the small mole perched just above the man’s upper lip.</p><p>In that instant, recognition crashed over him like a wave.</p><p>Hokuto.</p><p>This was Hokuto.</p><p>Taiga’s mind reeled, trying to reconcile this striking figure with the quiet, bookish boy from his memories. He watched, frozen, as Hokuto approached the car with long, confident strides.</p><p>The car door beside Taiga opened, and suddenly Hokuto was there, leaning down to peer into the backseat. His eyes met Taiga’s, and a shy smile spread across his face — a smile that was achingly familiar despite everything else that had changed.</p><p>“Long time no see,” Hokuto said softly, his voice deeper than Taiga remembered but still carrying that same gentle tone.</p><p>Taiga found himself dumbfounded, his usual quick wit deserting him entirely. He stared up at Hokuto, suddenly and acutely aware that his childhood friend had grown into an undeniably attractive man.</p><p><em>Shit</em>.</p>

<h2 class="heading">awkwardness</h2>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Hokuto leaned his head against the cool glass of the car window, watching the familiar streets slip by. The rhythmic hum of the engine and the gentle sway of the vehicle were comforting, a stark contrast to the tumult of emotions swirling inside him.</p><p>He’d made this trip to the marina countless times with Shintaro and Aoi, always the amiable third wheel to their couple’s outings. But today was different.</p><p>Today, the dynamic had shifted, and Hokuto could feel the change like a tangible presence in the car.</p><p>His eyes drifted to the right, catching a glimpse of Taiga next to him. Taiga’s gaze was fixed out the window, his expression distant and unreadable.</p><p>Hokuto’s heart clenched at the sight. It was surreal to see Taiga here, back in Kumamoto after all these years.</p><p>The memory of Shintaro's text message from a few days ago flashed through Hokuto’s mind. “Picking up Taiga-nii from Tokyo,” it had said, simple and matter-of-fact.</p><p>Those five words had sent Hokuto’s world spinning.</p><p>He’d always assumed Taiga’s silence over the years meant success. In his mind, Taiga had been too busy living his dream, too caught up in the whirlwind of Tokyo’s photography scene to keep in touch with his old friend back home.</p><p>Hokuto had told himself it was fine, that Taiga’s silence was a good sign. After all, wasn’t that what they had all wanted for him? To spread his wings and soar?</p><p>But now, seeing Taiga’s subdued demeanor, Hokuto realized how wrong he’d been. The Taiga he remembered had been vibrant, full of life and endless enthusiasm. This Taiga seemed… diminished somehow, as if Tokyo had worn away at his edges.</p><p>Hokuto’s fingers itched to reach out, to offer some sort of comfort or reassurance. But he held back, unsure of where they stood now. Five years was a long time, and Hokuto didn’t know if he still had the right to that kind of intimacy with Taiga.</p><p>Instead, he let his gaze wander over Taiga’s profile, cataloging the changes time had wrought. Despite the obvious exhaustion etched into Taiga’s features, the dark circles under his eyes speaking of sleepless nights and heavy burdens, Hokuto couldn’t help but marvel at how stunning Taiga still looked.</p><p>Time had changed them both, but Taiga’s beauty remained unchanged, perhaps even enhanced by the subtle marks of maturity. His jawline was sharper now, giving him an air of refined elegance that hadn’t been there in their youth.</p><p>But it was Taiga’s eyes that truly captivated Hokuto, just as they always had.</p><p>Those doe eyes, wide and expressive, had been the first thing Hokuto had noticed about Taiga when they were children. Even now, despite the weariness clouding them, Hokuto could remember how they used to sparkle whenever Taiga talked about photography. His passion would light up his entire face, his eyes shining with an inner fire that Hokuto found irresistible.</p><p>Hokuto’s mind drifted back to their college days, to the moment he realized he had fallen in love with Taiga. It wasn’t like the clichéd revelations he had read about in his favorite romance novels. There were no fireworks, no sudden epiphanies, no dramatic declarations in the rain.</p><p>Instead, it had happened on an ordinary day, just like any other. They had been relaxing after classes, sprawled out on the grass in the campus quad. The late afternoon sun had painted everything in warm, golden hues, and Taiga had his camera out, as usual.</p><p>Hokuto remembered watching Taiga work, his movements fluid and natural as he adjusted settings and framed shots. Taiga had been completely in his element, lost in the world he saw through his lens. His brow had been furrowed in concentration, his bottom lip caught between his teeth as he focused.</p><p>And then, Taiga had looked up, catching Hokuto’s eye. He’d grinned, that bright, unguarded smile that seemed reserved just for Hokuto, and something in Hokuto’s chest had shifted.</p><p>It was as if the world had tilted on its axis, everything realigning around this new truth: He was in love with Taiga.</p><p>The realization hadn’t been earth-shattering. It had settled over him gently, like a warm blanket, comfortable and right.</p><p>Of course, he was in love with Taiga. How could he not be?</p><p>Taiga, with his boundless enthusiasm, his fierce determination, his ability to find beauty in the most unexpected places.</p><p>Taiga, who could make Hokuto laugh even on his worst days, who understood Hokuto’s silences as well as his words.</p><p>Hokuto had kept that realization to himself, treasuring it quietly. He’d been content to bask in Taiga’s presence, to support his dreams, to be the steady rock Taiga could always rely on.</p><p>Even when Taiga had announced his plans to move to Tokyo, Hokuto had swallowed his feelings and offered nothing but encouragement.</p><p>Now, years later, with Taiga back in Kumamoto, those feelings resurged with a vengeance. Seeing Taiga again, even in this subdued state, made Hokuto’s heart race just as it had back then. The urge to reach out, to offer comfort, to somehow erase the lines of worry from Taiga’s face was almost overwhelming.</p><p>But Hokuto held back, unsure of where they stood now. Five years was a long time, and he didn’t know if he still had the right to that kind of closeness with Taiga. So instead, he contented himself with these stolen glances, memorizing every detail of Taiga’s face, comparing it to the image he’d held in his heart all these years.</p><p>“Do I have something on my face?” Taiga’s voice cut through Hokuto’s reverie, tinged with a mix of amusement and embarrassment.</p><p>Hokuto blinked, suddenly aware that he’d been caught staring. Heat rushed to his cheeks as he realized how long he must have been lost in his thoughts, his gaze fixed on Taiga.</p><p>“I…uh…” Hokuto stammered, his usual eloquence deserting him. He watched as a faint blush spread across Taiga’s cheeks, mirroring his own.</p><p>Shintaro’s laughter filled the car, breaking the tension. “Give him a break, Taiga-nii,” he said, his eyes twinkling with mirth in the rearview mirror. “Hokuto’s probably just amazed you’re actually here with us. It’s been so long, after all.”</p><p>Grateful for the lifeline, Hokuto latched onto Shintaro’s explanation.<br/>
“Y-yeah,” he managed, trying to keep his voice steady. “It’s just... surreal, you know? Having you back here.”</p><p>He forced a smile, hoping it looked more natural than it felt. Inside, his heart was racing, a mix of relief at not being caught out and disappointment at having to hide his true feelings.</p><p>The truth was, Hokuto had never told anyone about his feelings for Taiga. Not Shintaro, not Aoi, not even his own family. It was a secret he’d kept close to his heart for years, nurturing it in private while presenting a façade of simple friendship to the world.</p><p>Shintaro, in particular, was a complication Hokuto hadn’t known how to navigate. He'd always been protective of Taiga, stepping into the role of the responsible older brother despite being the younger sibling. Hokuto had seen firsthand how Shintaro could react to anyone he perceived as a potential threat to Taiga’s wellbeing.</p><p>The fear of losing not just Taiga, but Shintaro as well, had kept Hokuto silent all these years. The Kyomoto brothers were such an integral part of his life; the thought of jeopardizing those relationships terrified him.</p><p>So he’d buried his feelings deep, content to remain in orbit around Taiga, close but never quite touching.</p><p>Now, with Taiga back and those feelings resurging stronger than ever, Hokuto found himself on shaky ground. He’d spent so long convincing himself that his love for Taiga was a thing of the past, a youthful infatuation he’d outgrown.</p><p>But one look at Taiga, one moment of being caught in those doe eyes, and all his carefully constructed defenses came crumbling down.</p><p>The car came to a stop in the marina parking lot, the engine’s hum fading into silence. Shintaro was the first to exit, quickly rounding the vehicle to open the door for Aoi. Their fingers intertwined naturally as they started walking toward the docks, their silhouettes cutting a picture-perfect couple against the backdrop of bobbing boats and glittering water.</p><p>Hokuto hesitated, watching as Taiga slowly emerged from the car. There was a reluctance in Taiga’s movements, a subtle drag in his steps as he trailed behind Shintaro and Aoi.</p><p>Without thinking, Hokuto found himself hanging back, falling into step beside his old friend.</p><p>The silence between them felt heavy, laden with years of unspoken words and missed opportunities. Hokuto’s mind raced, searching for the right thing to say. Eventually, he settled on the most obvious question, though he already suspected the answer.</p><p>“So, um... how have you been doing, Taiga?” Hokuto asked, his voice soft and tentative.</p><p>Taiga’s lips quirked into a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “I’m fine,” he said, the words sounding rehearsed. “Just... adjusting, you know?”</p><p>Hokuto nodded, recognizing the lie for what it was. He knew Taiga well enough, even after all these years, to see the pain hidden behind those two simple words.</p><p>But he didn’t press, understanding that Taiga might not be ready to delve deeper.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Taiga suddenly blurted out, his eyes fixed on the ground. “For not keeping in touch, I mean. I should have—"</p><p>“Hey, no,” Hokuto interrupted gently. “I’m equally to blame. Communication goes both ways, right? I could have reached out more too.”</p><p>Taiga looked up at him then, gratitude softening his features. For a moment, Hokuto caught a glimpse of the boy he’d fallen in love with all those years ago, hidden beneath the weariness of the man walking beside him now.</p><p>“What about you?” Taiga asked, changing the subject. “Shintaro mentioned you’re working at a travel agency now?”</p><p>“Ah, yeah,” Hokuto confirmed, nodding. “It’s not exactly what I imagined I’d be doing, but...”</p><p>He hesitated, unsure how to continue. There was so much he wanted to say, about his job, about his life, about the dreams he’d put on hold.</p><p>But before he could find the words, Shintaro’s voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Oi, you two!” Shintaro called back, his tone playfully scolding. “What’s with the slow walking? We don’t have all day, you know!”</p><p>Hokuto and Taiga exchanged a look, a flicker of shared amusement passing between them. For a moment, it felt just like old times, the three of them heading out on another adventure.</p><p>But the moment passed quickly, reality settling back in as they quickened their pace to catch up with Shintaro and Aoi.</p><p>As they approached the dock, Hokuto paused for a moment to admire Shintaro’s boat. The sleek vessel bobbed gently in the water, its navy blue hull gleaming in the afternoon sun. It was proof of Shintaro’s dedication and hard work, a dream realized through years of saving and planning.</p><p>Hokuto remembered how Shintaro had always talked about owning a boat someday. As an avid fisherman, Shintaro had spent countless hours by the water, dreaming of the day he’d have his own vessel to take out onto the open sea. It had been more than just a wish; it was a goal he’d worked tirelessly towards.</p><p>The memory of Shintaro’s excitement when he'd finally purchased the boat brought a small smile to Hokuto's face. It had been a proud moment for his friend, the culmination of years of hard work at the ryokan. Shintaro had put in long hours at the family business, taking on extra responsibilities and saving every yen he could.</p><p>When he’d been promoted to assistant manager, that first salary had been the final push he needed to make his dream a reality.</p><p>Hokuto recalled the day they had taken the boat out for the first time after Shintaro bought it. It had been a perfect summer day, the sky a brilliant blue and the sea calm and inviting. They had spent hours on the water, Shintaro proudly showing off every feature of his new boat while Hokuto listened with genuine interest. The joy radiating from his friend had been infectious, and Hokuto had found himself swept up in the celebration.</p><p>But even in the midst of that happy memory, there had been a bittersweet undercurrent. Taiga had already been in Tokyo by then, chasing his own dreams far from Kumamoto. His absence had been keenly felt that day, a silent third presence in their duo.</p><p>It was on that boat, under the warm summer sun, that Hokuto had made a silent promise to himself. He had sworn that he would move on from his feelings for Taiga, that he would let go of his first love and focus on the life he was building in Kumamoto. It had seemed like the right thing to do at the time, a necessary step towards adulthood and moving forward.</p><p>Now, standing on the dock with Taiga just a few steps away, Hokuto realized how futile that promise had been. All it had taken was one look at Taiga, one conversation, and all those carefully buried feelings had come rushing back to the surface. The years of distance and silence hadn’t diminished his love; if anything, it had only deepened it, transforming from a youthful infatuation into something more mature and enduring.</p><p>As Hokuto watched Taiga cautiously approach the boat, he knew with certainty that he couldn’t keep that promise to himself. His heart, it seemed, had never truly let go of Taiga.</p><p>And now, with Taiga back in Kumamoto, back in his life, Hokuto found himself facing feelings just as strong, if not stronger, than they had been all those years ago.</p><p>Shintaro’s voice cut through Hokuto’s reverie, snapping him back to the present.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get her ready to sail!” he called out, effortlessly slipping into the role of captain. “Hokuto, can you check the lines? Taiga-nii, I need you to help me with the gear.”</p><p>Hokuto nodded, moving towards the mooring lines without hesitation. He noticed Aoi was already in motion, retrieving life jackets and stowing away loose items in the cabin. There was an easy synchronicity to their movements, speaking of countless trips taken together.</p><p>As he worked, Hokuto couldn’t help but observe the subtle interactions between Shintaro and Aoi. A shared glance here, a brief touch there — small gestures that spoke volumes about their relationship.</p><p>It warmed Hokuto’s heart to see his friend so happy, so settled.</p><p>The memory of Shintaro confiding in him about his plans to propose to Aoi surfaced in Hokuto’s mind. He remembered the mixture of excitement and nervousness in Shintaro’s voice, the way his eyes had lit up when he talked about his future with Aoi. Hokuto had felt honored to be trusted with such a significant moment in his friend’s life.</p><p>That recollection, however, brought with it a twinge of resentment toward Taiga. Hokuto glanced at him, watching as he awkwardly tried to follow Shintaro’s instructions. It bothered Hokuto that Taiga hadn’t even taken the initiative to ask Shintaro about his life, about the significant changes that had occurred while he was away in Tokyo.</p><p>The engagement, the boat — these were huge milestones in Shintaro’s life, and Taiga seemed oblivious to them.</p><p>Yet, Hokuto couldn’t help but notice how quickly Shintaro had rushed to Taiga’s aid when he called from Tokyo. Whatever resentment Shintaro might have harbored seemed to have been overwritten by brotherly concern.</p><p>As he watched the brothers fumble through their task together, Hokuto found himself hoping that they could recapture the easy rapport they once shared. He yearned to see them fall back into their old patterns, to witness the playful banter and unspoken understanding that had always characterized their relationship.</p><p>Despite the years and distance between them, Hokuto believed that the foundation of their brotherhood remained strong. Maybe, with time and patience, they could rebuild what had been lost.</p><p>With preparations complete, Shintaro took his place at the helm, his hands confidently gripping the wheel. Aoi stood beside him, her presence a steady support.</p><p>Hokuto settled into a seat nearby, then turned to Taiga, who was still standing awkwardly on the deck.</p><p>“Hey,” Hokuto called softly, patting the space next to him. “Why don’t you sit here?”</p><p>Taiga hesitated, his eyes darting between Hokuto and the offered seat. For a moment, Hokuto thought he might refuse, but then Taiga nodded and began to make his way over.</p><p>Just as Taiga took a step forward, Shintaro started the engine. The sudden roar and lurch of the boat caught Taiga off-guard. He stumbled, losing his balance and pitching forward directly toward Hokuto.</p><p>Instinctively, Hokuto reached out, his arms encircling Taiga and preventing him from falling further. The momentum brought Taiga crashing against Hokuto’s chest, their faces suddenly mere inches apart.</p><p>Time seemed to slow as they stared at each other, both too stunned to move. Hokuto found himself lost in Taiga’s eyes, noticing for the first time the flecks of gold in their brown depths. He was acutely aware of every point of contact between them — Taiga’s hands gripping his shoulders, the warmth of Taiga’s breath on his cheek, the weight of Taiga’s body against his own.</p><p>At that moment, Hokuto was struck anew by Taiga’s beauty. The afternoon sun caught in Taiga’s hair, highlighting strands of auburn among the brown. His skin was smooth and pale, a faint blush spreading across his cheeks.</p><p>Taiga’s lips were slightly parted in surprise, and Hokuto felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to close the distance between them.</p><p>The spell was broken as Taiga seemed to come to his senses. He scrambled backward, nearly tripping again in his haste to put distance between them.</p><p>“I-I’m sorry,” Taiga mumbled, his face now a deep shade of red. He quickly sat down next to Hokuto, but left a noticeable gap between them.</p><p>“N-no, I’m sorry,” Hokuto sputtered in return, his own face feeling hot. “I didn’t mean to... I mean, I was just trying to catch you.”</p><p>As Taiga nodded awkwardly in acknowledgment, Hokuto found himself hyper-aware of the lingering warmth where Taiga had been pressed against him. The phantom sensation of Taiga in his arms made his heart race, and he struggled to regain his composure.</p><p>As the boat glided smoothly across the water, an uncomfortable silence settled between Hokuto and Taiga. Up front, Shintaro and Aoi chatted quietly, their voices barely audible over the hum of the engine and the splash of waves against the hull. Their easy conversation only highlighted the awkwardness hanging between Hokuto and Taiga.</p><p>Hokuto found himself at a loss for words. In the past, silence between them had been comfortable, even enjoyable. He could vividly recall afternoons spent with his nose buried in a book while Taiga moved around him, camera in hand, capturing the world through his lens.</p><p>Those quiet moments had been some of Hokuto’s favorites, each of them absorbed in their own passions yet still connected by their shared presence.</p><p>But now, the silence felt oppressive. Hokuto snuck a glance at Taiga, noticing with a pang that he hadn’t brought his camera. It seemed wrong somehow, Taiga without his constant companion. The absence of the camera felt like a physical representation of all that had changed between them.</p><p>Struggling to find a way to break the tension, Hokuto fell back on his most reliable coping mechanism. He reached into his backpack and pulled out his current read: “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion” by Robert Cialdini. The familiar weight of the book in his hands brought a small measure of comfort.</p><p>Hokuto opened the book to where he had left off, trying to lose himself in the words on the page. But even as his eyes scanned the text, his mind kept wandering back to the man sitting next to him. He was acutely aware of every shift in Taiga’s posture, every soft exhale, every moment their arms almost, but not quite, brushed against each other.</p><p>The words on the page blurred as Hokuto found himself reading the same sentence over and over again, unable to focus. Still, he persisted, clinging to the book like a lifeline in the sea of awkwardness that surrounded him and Taiga.</p><p>Hokuto’s concentration was broken by a soft chuckle from beside him. He looked up from his book to find Taiga watching him, a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>“I’ve never seen that before,” Taiga remarked, nodding toward the book in Hokuto’s hands. “Actually, I don't think I’ve ever seen you read anything but fiction before. That’s new.”</p><p>Hokuto blinked, surprised. “You remember what I used to read?”</p><p>Taiga shrugged, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Of course. You always had your nose buried in some fantasy novel or another.”</p><p>The fact that Taiga remembered such a detail about him sent a warm flutter through Hokuto's chest. He ducked his head, feeling suddenly shy. “Ah, well... This is kind of for work, actually. Non-fiction helps with the travel agency stuff.”</p><p>Taiga’s eyebrows rose in curiosity. "I really wouldn't have pegged you for that kind of work. No offense, but you’re not exactly the most extroverted person out there.”</p><p>Hokuto chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “None taken. You’re right, it’s not the most obvious fit. But... I love Kumamoto, you know? I wanted to do something to help our hometown, especially after the earthquake six years ago. Promoting tourism seemed like a good way to contribute.”</p><p>At the mention of the earthquake, Taiga’s expression changed. His eyes widened slightly, and he seemed to tense up.</p><p>Hokuto opened his mouth, about to ask if something was wrong, when Shintaro’s voice rang out from the front of the boat.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p>
