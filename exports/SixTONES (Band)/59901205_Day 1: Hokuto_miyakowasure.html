<div class="userstuff">
<p>The three vampires’ apartment was <i>huge</i>. Hokuto had never seen one quite like it before. Sure, he had expected it to be fancy, being located in Daikanyama, but he still hadn’t expected the three vampires to own two whole floors at the top of a brand new apartment building. The wide, beautifully lit hallway led to a big living room with an adjacent open kitchen. There also had to be at least six bedrooms if everyone was to have one of their own.</p><p>Hokuto picked on a loose thread in the sleeve of his jacket, feeling his cheeks heat up at the thought of the bedrooms. The vampire he had signed a contract with, Kochi Yugo, had smiled at him so warmly, he still felt it in his chest. He knew about the…<i>pleasant side effects</i> of being bitten, everyone knew about them. But he didn’t know yet whether Kochi would like to do the biting in a bed. Perhaps it wasn’t necessary to dwell in that particular question too long. He would probably find out soon enough. Anyway, he had a feeling they were going to get along just fine.</p><p>He had done a shitload of research before sending his application of course, and he was confident he would be up to the task. He didn’t mind housework, he didn’t mind the prospect of being bitten, and the idea of immortality intrigued him, no matter how horrified his family had been about it.</p><p>“You realize everyone around you is going to die?” his brother had bluntly asked when Hokuto had told his family about his new job. “You’ll stay as you are, but we will grow old, and eventually you’ll lose us all, even if you never even decide become an actual vampire. Are you prepared for that?”</p><p>His brother was right, of course. Not many people fancied the lifestyle of a vampire’s familiar, with all the restrictions and responsibilities, and inevitable sorrows, though many liked to joke and dream about possible immortality.</p><p>Hokuto hadn’t made his decision lightly; he knew it wouldn’t be easy. But then he had thought about <i>time</i>. The idea of possibly having all the time in the world to read and write and learn about <i>everything</i> outweighed his fear of losing people.</p><p>Besides, he wouldn’t be alone. If he ever decided he wanted to become a vampire, wouldn’t that mean he had already found life with his employer worth it?</p>
