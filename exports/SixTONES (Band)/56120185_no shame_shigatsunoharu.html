<em>Angel, with the gun in your hand</em><br/>
<em>Pointing my direction, giving me affection</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Haven’t seen you in a while, darling,”<br/>
<br/>
The way this man just sank to the seat next to him gave Hokuto tons of questions—his motives, his target, his recent <em>whereabouts</em>. Indeed, distance was in their way for three months. But it’s what comes naturally from their job, anyway. Hokuto’s not the one to make a fuss over it. Apparently, the younger one does.<br/>
<br/>
“We’re in a club, get your shit together,” though the affection did something to his heart—it did flip on <em>darling</em>—he surely wanted the mission to finish safely.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry, darling, it’s a hallowed ground for us,” and then came the wink, making Hokuto so sure to throw all the younger’s belongings out of their <em>shared</em> apartment tonight. The teasing, in the middle of a high-risk mission that probably would require level five use-of-force, was not pretty. At all.<br/>
<br/>
“Hallowed ground for you, yes,” Hokuto sneered. “You’d get married here if you could. You’re no angel, even in the slightest.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re making me sound like an alcoholic. This is a club where we first met. It will be romantic to get married here,” he sounded so confident because boy was down for nostalgia. “Though that doesn’t make you a demon. You’re an angel, loaded with guns.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Love is fatal</em><br/>
<em>Won't you give it a chance?</em><br/>
<em>Center of attention</em><br/>
<em>Don't you ask me any questions</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>One could feel like they’re climbing a skyscraper after the first inhale. Nobody knows what comes next. Drug is just insane.<br/>
<br/>
The chief dressed him in simple light-colored shirt, all buttoned up, with skin-tight leather jeans. It looked like he wasn’t trying to impress anybody, but a little bit out of place with that blue bowtie. Hokuto made sure to put his awkward front for this mission to work. Call him everything but bait, or someone would come running to break your neck (it’s Jesse, his partner in work and real life. And yes, <em>Hokuto was the bait</em>).<br/>
<br/>
It’s always been easy because Hokuto’s sure if he’s not an officer, he might as well be an actor. The chief called him a natural. Jesse didn’t like it. Hokuto knew why but never quite addressed it. Hence why he was still doing this kind of job even now. He likes it.<br/>
<br/>
It took Hokuto three hours until someone came and stole Jesse’s seat. The younger raised his eyebrow, not amused, at all. However, this was the only way everything could ever be done. Jesse had to bite back a bark when an arm suddenly slung over Hokuto’s shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
They talked. That <em>someone</em> whispered, one thing led to another, Hokuto giggled. <em>Giggled</em>. Dear Lord, Jesse could taste the iron in his mouth by now. <br/>
<br/>
Hokuto still needed Jesse to be there for a little while. Question after questions, Hokuto realized this guy was indeed what they wanted. After some time he offered Hokuto a glass, an almost too light red-colored drink. Well, it looked like he was just trying to put it close to Hokuto’s mouth instead of offering. In character, Hokuto awkwardly dodged it and got the neck of the glass, looking apologetic but convincing that he was just afraid to drink it—like a nerd usually does.<br/>
<br/>
Still talking, Hokuto carefully slid the glass behind the guy’s back. Jesse took it, trying something.<br/>
<br/>
The nail polish. It changed color.<br/>
<br/>
It would be fatal not to be professional, they said. However, logic went out of the window because by the time the guy responded to some strange shoulder tap, Jesse gave him the black-and-blue mark.<br/>
<br/>
“Is he even a police officer?”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
<em>Go on and light me like a cigarette</em><br/>
<em>Even if it might be something you regret</em><br/>
<em>You got me now, now, now</em><br/>
<em>Swallow me down, down, down, down</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>“This is why they don’t pair us together so often,”<br/>
<br/>
“They don’t know I’m dating you,”<br/>
<br/>
“So we’re just ‘dating’?”<br/>
<br/>
With sirens in the background, Jesse just absentmindedly lit the cigarette between his lips, ignoring Hokuto. Today was yet another success, it was not hard to capture ‘extreme horny small-dicks’—it was the younger’s terms. Smoking is something Jesse would do after good missions. <em>“It’s like a reward,”</em> he quotes from a meme, not a hint of shame being chronically online. Hokuto, on the other hand, is always the one tailing him to the nearest abandoned alley or some smoking areas. He <em>always</em> put up with it.<br/>
<br/>
Not today.<br/>
<br/>
Because the older one decided that it was enough. Jesse going undercover for three months, coming back all flirty, not caring about protocols. Stir it up with jealousy.<br/>
<br/>
It was enough.<br/>
<br/>
So, Hokuto took the cigarette from Jesse’s mouth, placed it under his upper lips, and drew a quite full <em>gasp</em> from it. The smoke was green and pink under the neon lights of some random stalls. Jesse was in love, but not for long.<br/>
<br/>
“They said it’s the last of the chain, but we got them so easily. Some tango movements and they’re done with us. They didn’t kill anybody, good for the police. But I think it shouldn’t be this calm,” contradicting as he said it because another resistance started to pull off not-so-far from them, “Maybe I should just drink it, that suspicious red of something. I would be dead, yes, but at least they would sleep with me.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>Jesse was in love, but not for long.</em><br/>
<br/>
“You better finish that cigarette or else you’ll be blowing another thing from me.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><br/>
<em> I only light up when cameras are flashing</em><br/>
<em>Never enough and no satisfaction</em><br/>
<em>Got no shame</em><br/>
<em>I love the way you're screaming my name</em>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>basically i don't want to quite specifically explain what is their mission but yeah sex trafficking is the most common issue globally (79% bruh) and some is specified as high-profile missions. it's becoming urgent because: 1) killing becomes the EASIEST escape from the police, 2) countries don't really show data of the gender for trafficking issue, whether the victims or traffickers. it is crazy guys. no lol because what the fuck.</p><p>hope you enjoy reading though. don't hesitate to leave your thoughts!</p></blockquote>
