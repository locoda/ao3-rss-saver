    <h2 class="toc-heading">The way to a man's heart, and more</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>“Well?”</p><p>Shintaro’s face is expectant as he looks at Hokuto from across the table. Hokuto chews deliberately, savoring the flavors of the pasta on his tongue before finally swallowing and nodding approvingly.</p><p>“It’s super good,” he grins and then laughs when Shintaro makes a victorious fist pump. Hokuto knows he’s worked hard on perfecting the spaghetti aglio e olio.</p><p>It all started from their talk and joking on the radio, continued on the blogs, and finally about a week ago Shintaro messaged Hokuto, inviting him over to try <i>the perfect pasta</i>.</p><p>
  <i>I checked with the managers and apparently you’re free on Thursday evening. Is that okay? The sooner the better?!</i>
</p><p>Reading the message, Hokuto had smiled at his phone. He’d accepted the invitation instantly; truth be told, he’d already been waiting for it.</p><p>So here he is now, sitting in Shintaro’s dining room, with a surprisingly fancy setting (cloth napkins, stylish tableware, even candles). Shintaro’s really made an effort with the dinner; there was a nice starter salad with selfmade dressing and yummy bread, and there apparently is a dessert, too. And the main dish is absolutely delicious; Hokuto’s favorite flavors of garlic, olive oil and black pepper in perfect balance, topped with a generous amount of parmesan cheese.</p><p>“This is even better than at restaurants!” Hokuto compliments, mouth full, and means it.</p><p>Shintaro beams. “Thanks! But this is a restaurant? <i>The Taro’s,</i> didn’t I tell you?”</p><p>“Oh?” Hokuto plays along, snickering. “What happened with Re Appetit and the French cuisine?”</p><p>Shintaro shrugs and takes a sip of his wine. “Maybe I’ll switch to pasta after all... This wine is very good, by the way! Nice choice.”</p><p>“Good to hear.” Hokuto brought it with him, wanting to be a good guest. He'd spent quite a while researching for wines that go well with pasta, and is pleased that Shintaro likes his choice.</p><p>Hokuto takes a sip as well, hoping a little alcohol in his system will make him more relaxed. Under all his excitement about the evening, he’s also been a bit nervous. Shintaro’s doing so much to him, putting in so much effort that he can’t help thinking the night is somewhat <i>special</i>. That makes him nervous.</p><p>And foolishly hopeful, too.</p><p>It doesn’t help that they’ve jokingly called the evening a date once or twice in their messages over the past few days. Deep down Hokuto knows it is just that – a lighthearted joke, at least for Shintaro, and yet… He catches himself hoping against hope.</p><p>Maybe that smile, that look, that warm tone of Shintaro’s voice mean something? Maybe this splendid dinner he’s spent so long preparing just for Hokuto means something?</p><p>“Everything alright?” Shintaro’s question shakes him out of his thoughts, and he hurries to nod.</p><p>“Yeah, sure!”</p><p>Hokuto gulps down more wine and busies himself with the pasta to get a distraction from his own thoughts. He quickly glances up and sees Shintaro looking at him — and there it is again, the soft and somewhat piercing look he occasionally gives Hokuto. It makes Hokuto’s face heat up and skin prickle, and he starts babbling about the pasta and cooking in general, to hide his fluster and to divert Shintaro’s attention elsewhere.</p><p>It works well enough as Shintaro starts recounting his pasta cooking endeavours over the past few weeks. Hokuto leans back in his chair, listening to Shintaro’s animated explanation while he nods, hums along and laughs (and enjoys the opportunity to ogle while he’s at it. It's unfair how hot Shintaro looks with his off-the-work vibe, in casual homewear).</p><p>It’s luckily so simple and comfortable to talk with Shintaro, like always. Their talk and banter flows with ease, and soon it drifts to work and their recent happenings, especially their drama shootings and upcoming tour.</p><p>By the time they’re done with the food, the wine bottle is empty and they’ve shared countless thoughts and insights about their upcoming performances and tour details. Hokuto’s feeling nicely fuzzy yet perky, the earlier nervousness now almost completely gone.</p><p>”This was the best pasta I’ve ever had, I’m not even kidding,” he says and sighs happily, slumping down in his chair.</p><p>”Then this was all worth it!” Shintaro grins. He stands up and picks up the empty wine bottle.</p><p>”You want dessert now or a bit later?”</p><p>”Hmm, maybe later?”</p><p>Shintaro nods and fetches them a new bottle of wine instead. When returning he gestures towards the living room. “Let’s move to the couch? I’ll clean up the table later.”</p><p>Hokuto grabs their glasses and follows Shintaro, sitting down on the couch next to him. He tries to maintain a reasonable distance of not-too-far and not-too-close. He sets the glasses on the coffee table while Shintaro opens the wine bottle.</p><p>Hokuto probably shouldn’t drink anymore, his cheeks are already burning and his head feels light, but he lets Shintaro pour him a little. Their fingers brush when he takes the glass. It’s tantalizing.</p><p>Hokuto takes a small sip of the wine. Lowering the glass, he peers down into the liquid, swirling it in the glass. It feels like his mushy brain is moving too fast and too slow at the same time. Suddenly, he lets out a soft laugh.</p><p>”This really feels like a date, you know,” he blurts out. The wine’s making his tongue loose on top of everything else. Luckily his face is already flushed due to drinking so his blushing won’t be noticeable anymore.</p><p>Shintaro looks at him and raises his brows, a small smile on his face. ”Yeah? Is that a bad thing?”</p><p>”No! Absolutely not,” Hokuto says instantly. ”I… I like it.”</p><p>”Me too.” Shintaro’s voice and smile are warm. ”I’ve been wanting to have this date for a while already.”</p><p>Hokuto smiles at him while excitement and nervousness bubble in his stomach exhilaratingly. It’s a date, and they’re definitely flirting, but just how far will this all go? Hokuto and his tipsy mind decide in a split second that he’s ready to find out.</p><p>“So,” Hokuto says, tilting his head a bit, “what are your <i>moves</i> on dates?”</p><p>“My… moves?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>”Aren’t my charming personality and killer jokes enough?” Shintaro asks with a deadpan face, but breaks into a smile when Hokuto snorts despite himself.</p><p>“That depends.”</p><p>“And my amazing cooking?”</p><p>Feigning indifference and biting back a smile, Hokuto shrugs his shoulders. Shintaro gives him an eye roll and studies Hokuto for a moment, a quirky expression on his face. Then, it looks like he makes some sort of decision and takes quite a swig of his wine.</p><p>“Okay, wanna see one move of mine?”</p><p>“Sure?”</p><p>Shintaro reaches over and takes the wine glass off Hokuto’s hand, placing it and his own on the coffee table. He then inches a bit closer and lifts his right leg on the couch to sit sideways, facing Hokuto. Hokuto sits still, heart hammering against his ribcage. He’s frightened, he’s impatient, eyes flicking between Shintaro’s eyes and lips as the younger slowly leans closer.</p><p>Shintaro softly brushes Hokuto’s cheek and jawline with his fingers before he cups his face and presses his lips on Hokuto’s. The kiss is soft, lingering, tentative and Hokuto’s eyes flutter shut as he melts into it. It's a kiss that leaves one craving for more, as Hokuto realizes when Shintaro all too soon pulls back. He looks at Hokuto, studies his face and eyes, waiting for his reaction.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“A-a good move,” Hokuto manages.</p><p>They look at each other a split second longer before both lean back in, chasing new kisses which quickly turn longer and deeper. Hokuto pulls Shintaro closer to him, wrapping his arms around him. He hums contently as Shintaro brushes his tongue against his, slipping it into his mouth. Hokuto sucks on it and tilts his head for a better angle. He feels his glasses going askew but doesn’t care.</p><p>Only when he’s running out of air Hokuto breaks the kiss. He quickly takes off his glasses and puts them on the coffee table out of the way. Then, he lies down on his back on the couch, pulling Shintaro on top of him. Shintaro leans on his elbows, hovering over him for a moment and flashing him a quick grin before claiming his lips again. Taking advantage of the new position, Hokuto slips his hands under Shintaro’s shirt, feeling up the taut muscles of his back.</p><p>Shintaro drags his lips along Hokuto’s jaw and neck, kissing and licking here and there. Hokuto’s already panting, and when Shintaro suddenly grinds down against him, he moans out loud.</p><p>Shintaro lifts his head back up, nuzzling Hokuto’s cheek and nose, mouth hovering over his.</p><p>“I wanna hear more of that,” he says.</p><p>“Then show me more of your <i>moves</i>,” Hokuto whispers. He pecks Shintaro’s bottom lip playfully, pulling on it a bit with his teeth, and Shintaro kisses him before answering.</p><p>“I say we move this to the bedroom. If that’s okay and you want—”</p><p>“I do,” Hokuto says instantly and so eagerly he makes himself and Shintaro laugh.</p><p>Shintaro pushes himself up from the couch and pulls Hokuto with him. They hurry to the bedroom, shedding clothes on the way; Hokuto gets rid of his colorful secondhand sweater and Shintaro his hoodie.</p><p>Once in, Hokuto immediately walks back into Shintaro’s arms, helping him take off the t-shirt and toss it away. Seconds later, Hokuto’s undershirt flies to the floor as well and Shintaro’s hands are on him. They caress his sides, back, arms, travel up his neck and into his hair, and Shintaro kisses him with a new kind of fervor and urgency.</p><p>Hokuto clings to him and they stumble backwards towards the bed. When Shintaro’s legs meet the edge, he stops and swiftly pulls off his sweatpants. His hands move on to Hokuto’s belt, undoing it and opening up his pants at the same time.</p><p>“How do you wanna do this?” Shintaro asks. Hokuto feels his hands sliding in his pants, fingers trailing along the edge of his boxers teasingly.</p><p>Hokuto smiles and bites his lip, shoving Shintaro from the shoulders so he falls back and sits on the bed. Hokuto then climbs on top and straddles him, making both of them moan as their crotches rub together.</p><p>“Like this,” Hokuto breathes.</p><p>He kisses Shintaro, rolling his hips again, his mind filled with arousing images of him riding Shintaro like this, and that alone is almost too much already. Hokuto groans into the kiss, his dick throbbing in his pants.</p><p>Shintaro pulls back a little. “Okay, enough with the teasing. Pants off, now,” he ushers.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles but complies, stumbling off the bed. He strips out of his pants and boxers while Shintaro reaches for the bedside table, taking a lube and a condom out of the drawer and casting them on the bed for easy access. Then, he gets rid of his underwear before turning towards Hokuto again.</p><p>Sitting on the side of the bed, Shintaro looks at him up and down and up again, eyes hungry. Hokuto thought he’d feel even slightly awkward under Shintaro’s eyes all naked, but he finds he doesn’t. Quite the opposite; Shintaro’s lustful gaze just turns him on more. Hokuto steps closer to him again and as soon as he’s within reach, Shintaro pulls him close by the small of his back.</p><p>Shintaro holds Hokuto by the hip while he brings up his other hand, palming at Hokuto’s erection before wrapping his fingers around it. He pumps it a couple of times, firmly, slowly. Hokuto grabs Shintaro's shoulders, closing his eyes and breathing heavily through his nose. He could easily come like this, but he also craves for <i>more</i>.</p><p>Hokuto grips Shintaro’s wrist lightly, halting his hand and looking down at him.</p><p>“I’m more than ready”, he says. “Now get inside me.”</p><p>Shintaro snorts. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>They both climb on the bed and Hokuto lays down on his side next to Shintaro, who immediately bends down to kiss him.</p><p>“Some prepping first?” Shintaro asks and picks up the lube.</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Quickly.”</p><p>He turns on his back, leaning on his elbows as Shintaro gently spreads his legs and presses lube-covered fingers on his hole. Shintaro is quick as prompted, and when he eventually adds a third finger and curls them inside Hokuto just right, Hokuto can’t help pushing back against his hand, impatient. He pants and wraps an arm around Shintaro’s shoulders to keep the other close. Shintaro leans over, his mouth hovering over Hokuto’s, their hot breaths mingling while he scissors Hokuto inside.</p><p>“I’m ready,” Hokuto breathes, and Shintaro nods, removing his fingers.</p><p>Shintaro picks up the condom, but Hokuto takes it from him. He sits up and smiles at Shintaro’s questioning look. He brings his hand to Shintaro’s cock and gives it a few firm strokes before ripping open the condom and rolling it on him carefully. After that, Hokuto takes the lube and squeezes a generous amount on his palm. He then grabs Shintaro’s cock again, stroking it and spreading the lube evenly.</p><p>Hokuto feels Shintaro’s hand on his nape, fingers threading into his hair. Shintaro dips his head, resting it next to Hokuto’s and his breathing growing heavier with each stroke of Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>“You better hop on before I come,” Shintaro warns and Hokuto lets out a breathy laugh.</p><p>He lets go of Shintaro’s cock a bit reluctantly and leans back on his elbows again. Shintaro spreads some more lube on himself and Hokuto’s entrance, before gently lifting Hokuto’s hips and slowly, carefully pushing in. Hokuto bites his lip and closes his eyes at the sensation.</p><p>“You alright?” Shintaro asks immediately and rubs a gentle hand along Hokuto’s thigh.</p><p>Hokuto nods. “Uh-huh. Help me up.”</p><p>Hokuto grabs on Shintaro’s shoulder while the other man hooks an arm around him and hoists him up on his lap. Hokuto sits down slowly, lowering himself on Shintaro’s cock completely and drawing breathy moans from both of them.</p><p>Hokuto rests his forehead against Shintaro’s, taking his face in his hands. Shintaro’s arm is still around him, holding and supporting him, while his other hand slides down to grab Hokuto’s ass, urging him to start moving.</p><p>So Hokuto does.</p><p>He rolls his hips like earlier, experimentally, and gasps at how amazing Shintaro’s dick inside him feels in this position. Shintaro quickly matches his movements, thrusting his hips up against him. When they find a shared rhythm, Hokuto picks up his pace and starts pounding harder and quicker. He closes his eyes and holds Shintaro by the neck, relishing in the euphoric feeling. For a moment, all he hears are their mixed pants and moans and skin slapping against skin.</p><p>“<i>Aah</i>, fuck, Hokuto–”</p><p>Hokuto opens his eyes and feels his insides churn with the way Shintaro’s looking at him, eyes dark and full of want. “You’re so… fucking pretty.”</p><p>Hokuto leans down and kisses him. “So are you,” he mumbles against Shintaro’s lips.</p><p>Hokuto tries picking up his speed even more; he feels he’s close already, his dick squeezed between their stomachs throbbing and leaking with pre-cum. Shintaro groans and snaps up his hips in sync with Hokuto’s movements. He mouths along Hokuto’s neck while Hokuto rides on his dick, chasing for his orgasm.</p><p>A couple more deep thrusts and Shintaro’s teeth on his neck, and Hokuto comes with a shuddering cry as a wave of pleasure washes over him. His cum spills on both of their stomachs.</p><p>Shintaro grips on his ass with both hands, bucking his hips hastily and Hokuto seeks his mouth in his high, the kisses sloppy and open-mouthed, and Shintaro groans into his mouth as he finally comes, too.</p><p>Hokuto waits it out, before shifting enough for Shintaro’s dick to slip out. He stays right there between Shintaro’s legs though, and stretches out his own legs on either side of him. Feeling languid and spent, Hokuto wraps an arm around Shintaro’s shoulder and rests his head against it, letting himself unwind and relax. Shintaro’s arms find their way around him, too, and for a moment they just sit there in each other’s embrace.</p><p>Eventually, they pull back slowly and look at each other, smiling. Shintaro’s hair is a mess, he’s sweaty, and he’s never looked better in Hokuto’s opinion. Hokuto leans in and kisses him.</p><p>After they withdraw, Shintaro brings his hand up and gently combs his fingers through Hokuto’s hair, which must be as wild as his.</p><p>“That was absolutely amazing,” Shintaro says, grinning at him.</p><p>“It was. A thank you for the dinner,” Hokuto says jokingly.</p><p>Shintaro raises his brows. “Will I get sex like this if I cook more for you? If so, I’ll do it every day.”</p><p>Hokuto snorts and shoves Shintaro’s shoulder, though truthfully, he absolutely wouldn’t say no to more sex like this. And soon.</p><p>“We <i>could</i> schedule another date.”</p><p>”Let’s,” Shintaro grins. ”But speaking of dinner, there’s still the dessert left. You need to try it.”</p><p>”This was quite a dessert already,” Hokuto muses. ”But I guess I could have another. Just… not yet?”</p><p>Hokuto lays his head on Shintaro’s shoulder, leaning against his warmth. They wrap their arms loosely around each other again, Hokuto rubbing his thumbs against the small of Shintaro’s back. He feels Shintaro’s lips on his shoulder, feather-like kisses placed on the skin.</p><p>In the end, it took them a while to get to the actual dessert.</p>
