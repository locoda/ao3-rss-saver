      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In the 18th century noblemen played a big part in Great Britain’s economy and trading expansion. In this Age of Enlightenment a lot of commoners dreamed about being part of the nobility, attending balls, meeting and trading with other countries and experiencing other cultures. For Taiga this life felt like a cage he couldn’t escape from and as he approached adulthood his family dreamed of nothing more than to make sure their legacy would be in good hands with a strong bond to another noblemen family. While Taiga had played along as long as he could all he was looking for was a way out. What he found when he finally dared to step out of his overprotective lifestyle was maybe more than he was able to handle, but it would also show him a world he didn’t even think of existing as all he had known so far was the human lifestyle. But discovering this eternal path brought a lot of trouble and consequences towards them both and now his last decision to make was if his new found connection to this eternal being was strong enough to make him want to tag along for his own eternity.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've been on this fic for 2 years and am so excited to finally post it!</p><p>I once wrote a vampire fic similar to this one, so yes if you find parallels then that is bc I wanted to add a few of the same dynamics, but I also wanted to switch the roles.<br/>This was supposed to be a one-shot, now it is a huge multi-chapter. It has a mix of everything. Comedy, action, angst, a bit of horror. I wrote this without any outline at all so I hope you will enjoy reading this chaos.</p><p>As always be prepared for grammar/spelling mistakes and plot holes.</p><p>Hope you'll have fun reading^^/</p></blockquote>

</p><p> </p><p>+++</p><p>1742 - Great Britain</p><p>+++</p><p> </p><p>"Young lord, how often do I have to tell you that you're not allowed outside alone at this hour."</p><p>Well she didn't have to tell him, because he was well aware. Aware of all the stupid overprotective rules his father had established over the years. The cause? None at all.</p><p>Their city was lively, but not dangerous. There was barely any crime at all and while Taiga's family was indeed of high status it wasn't like people disliked them or would give them any reason to worry for their safety.</p><p>Yet Taiga had always felt trapped, not just in his own way too spacious house, but also in the city itself. If he wasn't out with his family he always had someone from the house being at his side. Not even once had he been wandering around alone, at least that is what the maids and guards thought and told his parents.</p><p>Exactly one of those unknown moments had been discovered this time as he had tried to sneak out the house when everyone was asleep. Only at nighttime he could somehow experience some freedom.</p><p>Luckily he had always been prepared getting caught so he came up with a well thought through story of insomnia and sleepwalking which made the maid of the house worry for him enough to not scold him any further.</p><p>As his plans had been discovered that night he made the maid believe he had gone back to bed, but he could at least sneak out to his balcony as it wasn’t really a place away from their house.</p><p>Of course even at such a simple place his parents had always worried for him as well, because he could fall. When he had been a child he could still understand those worries, but with the years the rules got more and more ridiculous and now that he was about to become a young adult he felt like a prisoner in his own house, which actually turned him into a disobedient son, but of course without the knowledge of his father.</p><p>When Taiga stepped out on the balcony it was already right before dawn and he sat on the stone wall from which it was a good five meter fall to the ground floor. It would usually be enough to just stand on the balcony and there was absolutely no reason for him to sit down on the stone wall instead, but that was the disobedience he'd come to find a liking of even if no one was there to actually see it.</p><p>In the distance the fog over the valley slowly cleared away as the first sunbeams made it over the high mountains around the valley.</p><p>Their city was actually the last big one before the valley turned into a mountain chain so high that even though it was spring already the highest peaks were still white.</p><p>So often had he wondered what was beyond those mountains, but never had he gotten the chance to see for himself.</p><p>If they went somewhere then it was the other direction to the even bigger cities, his father always busy with work and Taiga not even in the mood to explore the cities, because after all it was always the same.</p><p>It was a few days later when his father announced that he would head out for a business trip and left the choice to Taiga if he wanted to join. Trying to find a polite excuse he refused, because he didn’t want to cause his father any trouble on the journey and luckily his father seemed more than happy about his wise choice as he had lied about wanting to focus on studying.</p><p>His mother was joining the trip so he ended up being alone at the house for the first time in a while. Of course there were still a few maids and guards around, but Taiga was used to sneaking away from them.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to try and eat something?” The maid tried again, but Taiga shook his head with a played painful expression.</p><p>He had made up a story about having a fever and a stomach ache to make the maids believe he would be in his room for the rest of the day. “It would be great if you could head to the city to get some medicine, but please let me rest for the day. I will come downstairs and pick them up later.”</p><p>Of course the maid nodded understanding and closed the door on which Taiga smiled and jumped out of bed, fully dressed already, because he didn’t want to waste any time.</p><p>He climbed down from his balcony as he knew his way down without falling, at least now and he made his way to the stables, watching out that no one would be around before he saddled his horse and rushed up a mountain path close to the house with his black mare before anyone could spot him.</p><p>“That was easier than expected,” Taiga said smiling to himself as he kept cantering up the path leading away from the city. Luckily it was still early enough so that no people crossed his way as a lot of them worked in the woods. Just through their work Taiga had spotted this path in the first place, but of course he had never been allowed on it.</p><p>At his usual short night escapes he had never dared to make his way up the mountain, after all even with a lamp he wouldn’t have been able to see enough and there wouldn’t have been anything to see from the top of the mountain in the middle of the night.</p><p>This time though he had gotten a pretty awesome opportunity so finally see what was behind their mountain range even though it was pretty cold in the morning, but at least it was sunny and for now Taiga could ignore the clouds coming in from the north as he would be long down the mountain again before they could reach the city.</p><p>He had made it more than half way up the mountain already when the path in front of him seemed to get more narrow with every passing minute until his mare didn’t seem comfortable to keep going as she kept spooking each time the plants around them kept brushing her legs.</p><p>“Seems like your part of the trip ends here,” Taiga said as he got off and decided to leave his horse behind and let her grass until he would come back to pick her up. He only wanted to take a look anyway and even if he walked he was sure he’d be back in less than two hours. It didn’t seem like the workers would usually follow the path this deep into the mountains in the first place.</p><p>The hike got more difficult towards the top and none of his clothes and especially not his shoes were actually made for an adventure like this. High black boots and uncomfortable cotton pants with a white shirt which was definitely going to be a different color on his way back had been a bad choice of clothes, but most of his other clothes were even more uncomfortable and too expensive to actually risk an outburst from his father if he got dirt on them.</p><p>Towards the peak of the mountain the trees slowly got less, but instead a lot of rocks blocked the path and he needed to actually start climbing if he wanted to somehow make it out of the forest and up to the open peak.</p><p>After a few more minutes of cursing and bruises on his hands, which he had to find excuses for later he had finally made it to the peak.</p><p>For someone who had the freedom to come up here as often as they wanted to, it was maybe a normal view, but for Taiga it was fascinating. On one side he could see their city, still covered with a light morning fog. On the other side of the valley the huge white peaks didn’t seem that high anymore now that he was up high as well, but the dark clouds behind them seemed to rush over to the valley even faster now.</p><p>When he turned to the other side all he could see was mountains. One after the other, one bigger than the first one! It wasn’t like he would be thrilled about walking along a mountain range for days, sleeping in the dirt and most likely feeling cold all the time, but it was still a magnificent view!</p><p>Not wanting to leave right away, Taiga sat down on one of the big rocks and just enjoyed the view. The closer he looked the more he was able to spot. There were paths through the thick forest leading away from the city, but they had obviously not been used in years, as it was hard to even spot them. Then his look wandered off to a smaller mountain in between, it was somehow hard to spot with all the white peaks around. A dark fir forest grew over that mountain while the other mountains had a lot of different types of trees, some of them now also showing flowers and bright green leaves.</p><p>Then Taiga spotted something even weirder about that mountain, there was a building on it! Only a part the roof was visible between the dark trees and Taiga couldn’t spot any path leading to it. While he had said he wouldn’t be up for a hiking trip this was a complete different matter. Something made him focus on that hidden building as if it wasn’t supposed to be found. He would need to get down from this peak and climb up to that small mountain again and while it didn’t seem too much of a steep hike there was also no direct path so he would need to make it through the thick forest, which could cost him a lot of time.</p><p>For a moment he turned towards the city, but it was still so silent down there, still too early in the morning to see more than a few carriages on the streets.</p><p>“Guess the only thing that could happen is me getting soaked on the way back,” Taiga said with another look up to the sky before he tried to find the easiest way down.</p><p>On his way off the mountain he still had a small path he could follow, but as expected it lead towards the opposite direction on the bottom, away from the dark forest.</p><p>Maybe it was the missing sunlight on this side of the mountain, but suddenly Taiga felt a lot colder.</p><p>Not knowing where the easiest way up would be, he just went straight up, hoping he could make it to the peak without any big obstacles. To his luck there seemed to be nothing, but a few old trees lying in his way. Some of them looking like they had been cut down by men to make the mountain more accessible, but that had been definitely years ago.</p><p>There was something that he noticed after stopping to take a break for a moment. On his way up to the first mountain with his horse he had spotted a few deer and even on the peak he had heard and seen some birds, yet on this mountain it was silent, way too silent. Not knowing why a shiver went through his body and he had to laugh at himself when he realized the goosebumps on his arms, maybe he should have actually worn a jacket with the low morning temperatures.</p><p>The peak of the mountain came into sight sooner than he had expected and then he also finally spotted the house. “Well that's what I call taste,” Taiga said, but the irony was obvious.</p><p>The building in front of him seemed as if it had been there for at least one century, maybe even longer. It didn’t look too damaged, but it also didn’t look inviting, at all. It was made out of black stones which was pretty unusual, at least if compared to all the cities Taiga had been in.</p><p>Carefully Taiga moved around the house, it was bigger than he had expected it to be. It had a pretty high roof, which was also black and the walls were high enough for two floors and around the corner was a small staircase up to a wooden double door.</p><p>The windows weren’t broken to his surprise, but a lot of weed was growing over them and they were so high up that Taiga wasn’t able to look inside anyway.</p><p>Taiga walked up the stairs as if he had been actually invited to this place before he knocked with one of the black heavy iron rings. The sound echoing through the building sounded as if it had a pretty high ceiling inside, but the house remained silent.</p><p>“Idiot,” Taiga said to himself with a chuckle. “Did you really expect someone to live here?”</p><p>No of course he hadn’t, which made him squeal even louder when something inside the house was heard. A sound like something had been tossed to the ground and Taiga jumped down the stairs. Then the house fell silent again.</p><p>The next thing to happen had him growl in annoyance, when the first rain drops hit him. “Really now?” After he complained the rain started to get even heavier in the matter of minutes until Taiga had to make a decision. Go home in the heavy rain or just try if the door of the building was actually open so he could see if the rain stopped after a while again.</p><p>With the sky getting even darker and lighting and thunder joining the heavy rain Taiga had enough and he hurried back up the stairs and pulled on the heavy wooden doors which moved with an obnoxious squeaking noise, almost sounding like someone screaming.</p><p>Taiga left the door open as he was faced with a pitch black entrance hall. While the building didn’t seem to have taken any damage from the outside it was different for the inside. But it wasn’t time itself which had brought destruction to the interior. Chairs had been ripped apart, vases and mirrors smashed to the ground. Maybe there had been thieves in here over the years, after all Taiga had definitely not been the first person to dare his way to this abandoned house.</p><p>He knew he should just wait at the door for the rain to stop yet he walked further into the entrance hall the same way he had been somehow dragged to this building in the first place he felt like he wanted to explore it more.</p><p>A heavy thunder made him jolt and he made a step back towards the door. Maybe the weather was a bad omen? Shouldn’t he have come to this place? But on the other hand the weather was at fault for him having to seek shelter.</p><p>After the thunder everything fell silent again until Taiga had the weird feeling of hearing something. The heavy rain made it hard to actually hear anything in particular and he wasn’t even sure if it was his imagination.</p><p>With the next lightning he had a better view of the room and he spotted a double staircase to a second floor and right before the room fell dark again he spotted something else, or more...like someone else?</p><p>It had been too short to be sure, he had only seen some shape that could have been some furniture or something else standing around the top of the staircase, which could easily been mistaken with a human, because of its size.</p><p>Always forgetting that thunder would follow after lightning, Taiga jolted again and made a step to the back on which he stepped on a few broken parts of the smashed mirror.</p><p>Then once more it was only the rain, or not? Again he felt like he was hearing something, but maybe he was mistaken, maybe it wasn’t actually a sound he was searching for? It was more of a feeling, something that let the hairs of his neck stand up since a few minutes ago and made his legs feel heavy. Something like a presence.</p><p>While he couldn’t see anything at all in the pitch black room he wanted to back off, to make it closer to the door, yet he felt how his legs seemed to get even heavier.</p><p>He had never been at such a place before so maybe it was natural to feel scared, especially with the weather adding an extra scare factor, but something told him that he wasn’t actually supposed to be THIS scared of an empty old building.</p><p>Just when he somehow managed to make another step backwards another lightning stroke. This time he didn’t even need to look around, this time he was left screaming when someone was standing so close to him that he could have actually touched him. But all he wanted to do was run as whoever that was, whatever that was didn’t actually look friendly. Cold, silver shining eyes had been staring at him from under a black hood and the moment the thunder hit and the room fell dark Taiga screamed again and turned, aiming for the door on shaking legs.</p><p>He slipped and fell hands first into the pieces of the mirror. A cut hand was the least he would whine about now though and all he wanted to was leave. It felt like it took him an eternity to make it to the door. His body feeling heavy, almost paralyzed as he finally got to the door. On unsteady feet he dashed out into the rain, completely forgetting about the staircase and stumbling down until he fell to his knees on the grass in front of the house.</p><p>Again he could hear it, like a voice from within. He knew that whatever was living inside that house was watching him and he didn’t dare to even turn around before he started running down the mountain through the thick forest.</p><p>This hadn’t been the adventure he had been seeking and now he would never be able to unsee. But to unsee what? What had he just seen? How could he not just say this was a human who played a pretty bad prank on him?</p><p>Whatever was living in that building was not human. So Taiga could only hope that it wouldn’t hunt him down, because he was sure he wouldn’t make it out alive!</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Feeling as if choking on a silent scream, Taiga sat up with a gasp, needing a moment to realize that he was in his room. A look to the big window showed that it was night time and he could clearly hear the sound of the continuing heavy rain.</p><p>A dream? First Taiga wanted to laugh it off, of course it must have been a dream, but that laugh died in his throat when he looked down at his hands.</p><p>Cut open and bleeding, already having turned half of his bedsheets into a mess. A look down his clothes made his breaths turn more and more erratic as he realized he was indeed in the clothes from his dream, which didn’t seem as if it had been one after all.</p><p>Without knowing what else to do he jumped up and got out of his clothes. He had even worn his boots in bed. He must have been in such a state of panic that he had just dashed back right to his room after-, right…</p><p>Remembering what he had seen another shiver went through his body and he hurried to light a lamp in his room and close the curtains, before he hurried to bandage his hand and rip the sheets of his bed to hide them in case some of the maids would come in.</p><p>Feeling way too shaken and confused about the situation Taiga got into clean clothes and made sure to hide his bruises and cuts as good as he could while walking through the house. Luckily everything seemed normal and one of the maids just handed him the medicine she got for him and asked if he was feeling better.</p><p>Another relief came when he found his mare sound and safe in the stable as he could barely remember how he had made it back in the first place.</p><p>When he got out of the stable he looked up to the mountain range, but he immediately felt like he shouldn’t look. Like he could draw that thing towards the city. Had he woken up something that should have been left alone in that building?</p><p>When he felt the same weird presence as before he almost ran back into the house, but he knew that he was alone this time. It wasn’t the same as in that house, but it felt like he could still feel its presence and it made him fear that it might also work the other way around. What if he could actually track him down?</p><p>There was no way he would be able to get any sleep and in a long time he didn’t feel like having one of his secret night walks through the city. Suddenly the night had become something extremely frightening to him.</p><p>***</p><p>It was the next evening when he realized that he hadn’t gone outside even at daytime, suddenly he felt as if he had fallen ill. Unfortunately not with a normal cold, more something heavy mentally that he had to deal with from now on, but what was he supposed to do? Going to that place ever again was out of question, not even together with his father he would go there.</p><p>Defeated by his own fear Taiga made sure that the lamp on the nightstand was lit when he was going to bed. The curtains were still shut from the evening before.</p><p>Maybe he should at least tell his father about what had happened? But would he believe him and how much scolding would he get? He took a closer look at the cut on his hand, but luckily it didn’t seem too bad, but he still needed to find an excuse for it when his parents returned the next week.</p><p>For what felt like hours he tried to think of a stupid excuse for his wound, while it was actually only a distraction from his mind drifting off to those silver shining eyes. After a lot of turning around he had finally managed to fall asleep.</p><p>But it seemed like in his sleep he was even more vulnerable, getting hunted down by the recent events. After getting chased through the whole city and seeing silver eyes everywhere Taiga woke up with a gasp.</p><p>When he had calmed down a bit he realized that he was feeling pretty cold, which was the fault of him tossing his sheets to the ground through his nightmare. Then another realization hit him when he couldn’t actually see the sheets on the ground, because the light was out!</p><p>He had made sure it was filled up so it shouldn’t be out. The only reason his oil lamp would usually turn off was when he opened the door to the balcony. That thought had him freeze in his movements right before he tried to get his sheets from the ground.</p><p>He looked over to the window and the curtains were closed, almost! There was a small gap open, which let a bit of the moonlight inside of the room. But here was the problem! He was sure that he had closed them completely and the window should be shut as well.</p><p>First Taiga thought if it was time to panic, but then he laughed it off, of course a maid had taken a look at him as he had been in bed way earlier than usual. So she had checked if the window was closed and turned the lamp off.</p><p>“I’m such a scaredy cat, seriously,” Taiga said to himself as he sat up to fetch the sheet from the ground. He sat up again ready to go back to sleep when he was sure he had mistaken waking up with just ending up in another nightmare.</p><p>There could be no silver eyes looking at him in his room if it wasn’t another nightmare, right? Taiga blinked a few times more, ready to wake up, yet nothing happened. Five seconds, ten seconds and then the figure in the dark moved, just slightly and yet it left Taiga screaming, throwing his sheets towards the dark figure before he jumped off his bed towards the other side. “No, no, no. This can’t be real, wake up! WAKE UP!” He was already clawing his fingers into his skin, but unfortunately the pain just proved that this was real.</p><p>He wanted to reach out for the lamp on his nightstand, but when he found enough courage to move again he found the silver eyes staring at him from the side of the bed, making him scream again and curl up on the ground. “GET AWAY FROM ME!”</p><p>For what felt like minutes Taiga remained on the ground, his breathing pace making him feel dizzy. After another moment in which he tried to get the shaking of his body under control he finally dared to look up to find no one standing next to the bed. Was it a dream after all? Carefully he turned towards the bed and this time he didn’t even have the energy to scream anymore when he spotted the figure next to the balcony door. What did he want? Why was he here? How did he even know where to find him?</p><p>“What do you want from me?” Taiga whimpered as he fell down on the ground resting with his back against the bed and hiding his face on his knees.</p><p>“Nothing in particular.”</p><p>The reply left him speechless, not because of what he had said, but because he had said something in the first place.</p><p>“Wait, what?” Taiga finally let out and sat up on his knees, turning carefully around to the figure standing next to the window. “You have no reason to be here?”</p><p>“Not really, but you woke me up so I was bored.”</p><p>Now Taiga was more than confused, but luckily the other one’s not existing intentions made him finally calm down a bit, but he remained cautious.</p><p>“How did you know where to find me and how did you get in here?”</p><p>“I got in through the balcony door and well your blood showed me everything about you.”</p><p>This conversation went towards a really awkward direction, but if they only kept talking then he had nothing to fear, right? “How can my blood tell you where I live? Did you follow me down the mountain?”</p><p>“I don’t need to follow you. I can track you everywhere now. Your scent is easy to track now that I know it.”</p><p>“Okay wait. I have no clue what you’re talking about.” Taiga honestly said before he finally dared to reach out for his lamp.</p><p>“I’d like to ask you to not turn that on,” the other one suddenly said and there was something in his voice that made Taiga refrain from turning the light on.</p><p>“I don’t feel comfortable in the dark,” Taiga replied on which the other one pulled the curtains open so that at least the moonlight would brighten the room up a bit.</p><p>Taiga wasn’t sure what he had expected, but it wasn’t a black haired boy his age, looking back at him with a calm expression. The only thing that made a shiver ran down his spine were the silver eyes.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“Hokuto,” the other one replied.</p><p>“Ehm, okay…” Taiga said. “And what are you?”</p><p>“I guess the same as you? Taiga, right?”</p><p>“How do you know my name?” Taiga asked now finally daring to stand up, but he could feel how his legs felt pretty heavy.</p><p>“I told you, with your blood I know everything about you. Where you live, your name, well everything.”</p><p>“Then I unfortunately have to tell you that you’re not the same as me, because I can’t do that,” Taiga said before he pointed at the other one’s face. “And I don’t have those eyes.”</p><p>“But if we are not the same what am I and what are you?”</p><p>“Well I am a human,” Taiga said, but couldn’t actually think of a reply for Hokuto. “You are, well different?”</p><p>As if he couldn’t tell the difference Hokuto looked down his own body and it could almost be called cute how he seemed so confused.</p><p>“Hokuto was it, right?” Taiga asked carefully and the other one nodded. “Hokuto, you said I woke you up, is that house your living place?”</p><p>“Yes I think so at least. I don't actually remember much.”</p><p>“What do you mean with you don’t remember? You know your name, right?”</p><p>Hokuto nodded, but he didn’t seem to have more to tell.</p><p>“So you lost your memory?”</p><p>“Partly maybe? There are things I remember and things I don’t, but since I woke up I feel indeed weird.”</p><p>“How many days have you’ve been sleeping?” Taiga asked as he crawled back on his bed, but didn’t dare to get closer to the other one.</p><p>“What date do we have?”</p><p>“Today it’s the 14th of the third month.”</p><p>“Which year?”</p><p>Was he serious? But Taiga just shook his head before he replied. “It’s 1742.”</p><p>Hokuto seemed to be lost in his thoughts for a moment  before he nodded. “Well then I have been asleep for 9245 days.”</p><p>This time Taiga just remained silent with his jaw dropping. “Excuse me, what?”</p><p>“You asked how many days I was asleep, right?”</p><p>“But, you- this…” Taiga needed a moment to even calculate before he dared to stand up this time, the closest he had dared to stand to Hokuto. “That is over twenty five years. That's like your entire life judging by your age? How can that be possible?”</p><p>“It’s easy, you lay down and you sleep I guess?”</p><p>This conversation was turning so ridiculous that by now Taiga was almost sure that someone was playing a prank on him.</p><p>“Okay, so let’s just keep going with other questions then,” Taiga said, massaging his temples, because he was getting a huge headache.</p><p>“Maybe next time,” Hokuto said as he took a look out of the window. “I’ve to leave now, but it was entertaining to talk to you. If you don’t mind I will come again and answer your questions next time?”</p><p>There was not a single good reason why Taiga was nodding, but Hokuto seemed pretty happy about it as he flashed him a smile before he opened the balcony door and vanished into the dark night without another word.</p><p>Minutes passed tormenting slow while Taiga tried to make any sense out of the situation and when he realized that it was slowly getting bright outside he gave up on going to bed again. There was no way he would be able to sleep anyway.</p><p>***</p><p>The next evening Taiga stood on his balcony until the last light of the day was finally vanishing behind the mountains. He still wasn’t sure what had actually happened over the past two days and how he was supposed to think about it.</p><p>“Hokuto,” he whispered the name of the other one, but did he want him to come back? Would he be able to actually look at him without getting scared of those silver eyes? What if he made him angry and things would get dangerous? Not that the other one gave him any reason to be scared of him in the first place, except maybe breaking into his room in the middle of the night.</p><p>Not knowing if he should even bother closing the door or the curtains Taiga kept staring outside with a lost expression before a knock on his door had him jolt.</p><p>“Young lord do you need anything?”</p><p>“No thank you, for tonight you can leave.”</p><p>Maybe he shouldn’t have said that, but it wasn’t like one of the maids wasn’t downstairs overnight time anyway. But what was he saying? Was he that afraid?</p><p>Not knowing what else to do he sat on his bed waiting, but even after hours Hokuto didn’t come, even though Taiga had left the door open, because Hokuto had proven that locked doors won’t stop him anyway. Then he realized that it had been maybe his mistake that Hokuto wouldn’t come as he realized that he had left on the lamp for the entire time.</p><p>In a hurry he turned the lamp off, leaving him with only the light from outside, but unfortunately the moon wasn’t out and it was way darker than the night before.</p><p>It was when he felt like light was disturbing him that he realized that he had fallen asleep and it had become morning without Hokuto showing up or had he been there, but didn’t wake Taiga up?</p><p>The weirdest part was that he felt kind of disappointed about it? And to make it all worse Hokuto didn’t show up for the next three days either. At that point Taiga’s disappointment had changed into anger.</p><p>He had been so angry that he had actually taken his horse up the mountain once more to get to Hokuto’s house, because why would he still be afraid of going?</p><p>And it was also his last chance of going before his father would come back the next day, so he could at least ask Hokuto why he wasn’t actually coming back, while he had said he would.</p><p>The weather made it even easier to make it to Hokuto’s house, but to his surprise it was as pitch black inside as before. The windows were so overgrown with plants that they didn’t let any sunlight inside, so Taiga left the door open again as he walked in. But then he stopped in the middle of the entrance hall.</p><p>After everything that had happened he had forgotten about the chaos inside the house and suddenly he felt a bit insecure. Shouldn’t he have come? Maybe Hokuto didn’t want anyone to see this in the first place? After all Taiga knew nothing about the other one, so this was maybe a really bad idea. When he realized that he walked into a stranger’s house without asking he stepped back, not that he had bothered the first time, neither had Hokuto bothered at his place.</p><p>“Hokuto? Are you home?”</p><p>No reply, the same as the first time he had come here, but Hokuto had been home then as well, right? He had said he was asleep, so maybe he had to be louder?</p><p>Once more he dared to get inside the house a bit further and he called out for Hokuto a few more times, but again no reply.</p><p>"I shouldn't do this," Taiga said to himself, yet he made his first steps up the stairs. A long corridor awaited him and the same as the entrance hall there was destruction all over the place. Furniture in several rooms had been turned upside down, doors were half hanging from the doorframes. Carefully Taiga looked inside the first room to his left, but he could barely see anything as the room had no window at all.</p><p>"How is anyone able to live here?" Taiga asked as he looked through the room, but couldn't find candles or lambs. Thinking about it he hadn't seen any candle holders in any part of the house yet.</p><p>With a weird feeling Taiga stepped back inside the corridor and looked through a few more rooms, but to his surprise they were all similar, except for one which was on the right end of the corridor and it was a huge library. There was another huge window in this room as in the entrance hall, but again plants had taken almost all chances of the light making it through, yet at least a bit light was making it in as it was a sunny day.</p><p>Taiga randomly looked through the big room, the shelves so high that he couldn't reach the highest one without a ladder. A big red armchair was standing next to a table where he found a book pile and one book that lay open. He lifted it up and turned it around to look at the cover.</p><p>"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World," Taiga read the cover. A book he had actually read himself when he was younger. But there seemed to be way older books in here as well. Books he had never seen in their town's library and that one was of course a lot bigger. Curiously he picked another book up and started reading on a random page.</p><p>Absentmindedly he walked through the room while reading until a sudden shiver made him remember where he was in the first place and he shook his head at himself before he closed the book and looked up.</p><p>With a yelp he stumbled back, falling over to the back and cursing on the way he had hit the back of his head on a shelf.</p><p>"Why did you fall?"</p><p>"Why did I fall? Come on, it's not every day that silver eyes randomly stare back at me from the dark," Taiga complained as he got back up, but then he halted. What was he doing? This was Hokuto's place. Furthermore he didn't even know the other one that well yet, what if he already angered him?</p><p>Taiga turned back to Hokuto who hadn't moved away from the dark corridor, before he bowed. "I'm sorry for intruding on your house without asking. I'll leave if you want me to."</p><p>"I don't mind," Hokuto said neutral. "I like that book. I read a lot after you woke me up."</p><p>That statement made Taiga remember his original purpose of coming here and he hurried to put the book back on the table, yet Hokuto still didn't follow him so Taiga walked back to the door.</p><p>"Why didn't you come back?" Taiga asked, trying not to sound offended.</p><p>"I didn't want to bother you that soon," Hokuto replied to his surprise.</p><p>"Soon? It's been days."</p><p>"I thought about waiting a few months."</p><p>Now he had left Taiga dumbfounded. Was the boy for real? Had he some trouble with time management, because he also had said a ridiculous number for the days he had been asleep.</p><p>"Okay… But my father is coming back tomorrow and you can't come when he is there."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because- well, strangers are not allowed in our house."</p><p>"But I'm no stranger anymore, you know my name," Hokuto said, this time flashing a small smile and somehow Taiga couldn't take his eyes off him until Hokuto tilted his head with a questioning look.</p><p>"My father is really overprotective. A name won't do it and to be honest I doubt he'll be okay with you coming at night so you would need to come at daytime and introduce yourself."</p><p>"Oh, that's a shame," Hokuto said and suddenly walked away from the room, Taiga first looking after him in confusion before he walked after him.</p><p>"Are you busy at daytime?"</p><p>"I sleep at daytime," Hokuto replied. "You woke me up again."</p><p>"Sorry," Taiga replied. Of course he should have thought of that, not that it made sense to him why he slept at daytime and especially in such a destroyed house.</p><p>Hokuto entered a room at the end of the corridor on the left. It was the same as the others and had nothing more than a bed, a wooden desk and chair in it. When Hokuto sat down on the bed, Taiga suddenly felt kind of awkward.</p><p>"Well, I guess I should be going."</p><p>"Sure," Hokuto said as if he didn't mind at all, but that reaction had Taiga stop once more.</p><p>"So that's it?"</p><p>"What?" Hokuto asked as he was about to just lie down again, but waited on Taiga's words.</p><p>"You came to my place without any further information and now we're not going to meet again?"</p><p>"You're welcome here if your father doesn't want me to come, but I'd prefer if you come at dusk."</p><p>First Taiga wanted to complain, but what other solution could he offer?</p><p>"I can't promise that I can come. My household is really strict," Taiga replied, but Hokuto didn't seem bothered by that.</p><p>"Come when you can make it. And if I'm welcome when your father is not home I can come and visit as well."</p><p>Taiga nodded slowly while Hokuto lay on the bed, telling him with that move that their conversation was obviously over.</p><p>"Then I'm looking forward to our next conversation, I guess…" Taiga whispered more to himself as he stepped out of the room, but there was no door left to close and with slow steps he moved down the corridor. Just after he had closed the double doors of the entrance he released a long breath as if he had held it the entire time.</p><p>"What the hell was this conversation?" He asked himself and tilted his head. After he had been so afraid of Hokuto at first he was not completely confused by him. Maybe his eyes were just something genetic and because he didn't seem to have any kind of job he just liked to sleep during daytime? But there was so much more to this, so many questions. Yet Taiga shook his head and started walking. He didn't want to give himself a headache with all the unsolved mysteries around Hokuto. Maybe if they finally had a real talk, things would finally make more sense.</p><p>But for now all of that had to wait and he needed to make sure his father wouldn't find out about it.</p>

  <p>"So you fell of your horse I've heard?"</p><p>His father's question fell on deaf ears for a moment until Taiga's mother let out an unpleased sound and Taiga's eyes immediately shot up from the dinner plate.</p><p>"Yes-, well, she spooked and I unfortunately hit some branches with my hands when I tried to land safely," Taiga explained after he had told the maids the same lie about his hands.</p><p>"Maybe we should get you a new horse-"</p><p>"No," Taiga interrupted his mother immediately. His horse was fearless and would usually never spook even at the loudest sounds. But then he wondered if she would spook if Hokuto was appearing in front of her.</p><p>"You're spacing out again," his father voiced out next and he gave his son a scanning look while the maids cleaned the dinner table. "Did anything happen?"</p><p>"Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for my fall of course."</p><p>"Okay. Then let's move to another topic. Taiga, we need to talk to you about something important."</p><p>That already didn't sound like a conversation he wanted to have and the kind of proud yet sheepish smile his mother showed, already told him what topic it would be.</p><p>"On our last trip we met some really impressive families. A lot of them are involved in international trading and politics," his father explained in excitement and Taiga tried his best to fake some excitement as well.</p><p>"We are going to meet some of them again next month at the ball at the major’s house," his mother added.</p><p>"And you want me to go there," Taiga concluded, both his parents exchanging a small smile. With a sigh Taiga fell back against the backrest. "And let me guess at least one of the families has a daughter my age."</p><p>"Always a step ahead, aren't you," his mother said, kind of proud. "They are beautiful, both of them.”</p><p>"I think the daughter of the trading family will be of your liking," his father added with an approving nod. "She's quite adventures for a girl and -"</p><p>"I want to introduce you to someone."</p><p>Taiga's words hung in the room for a while until he realized what he had said.</p><p>"Oh, who is she?"</p><p>Of course his mother would immediately guess that he was talking about a girl, but that wasn't even the point. Why had he said that in the first place? There was no way his parents wouldn't declare him crazy and Hokuto as some kind of weirdo if he actually introduced him to his parents. Furthermore they had barely met two times, well three if he counted the time he ran away screaming from Hokuto.</p><p>"It's-, …not a she."</p><p>And again he said something stupid. Why couldn't he just lie? He just did great in lying a few minutes ago.</p><p>"Oh? So you made a new friend? Is he from our city?"</p><p>Taiga relaxed a bit on his father's calm words and luckily his mother also didn't seem to see it necessary to get back to the marriage topic immediately.</p><p>"More or less. He lives close by, but not directly in the city. That's why he can't come by all the time," Taiga explained.</p><p>"Then I hope he can visit soon, we'd be pleased to meet him. After all, it's great news that you made a new friend," his father said.</p><p>A friend, right. Was Hokuto a friend? He wasn't even an acquaintance yet as Taiga knew nothing but his name so far.</p><p>"I can't wait to introduce him to you," Taiga said and wondered why his improvised lie made him smile.</p><p>***</p><p>"Young lord, I'm sorry to interrupt your studies, but the library is closing for today."</p><p>Taiga looked up from the book he was intensely reading for who knew how long. But one look out of the window showed him that it had been too long. Night had already fallen over the city and he was sure that the librarian had already extended the opening hours for him as he had missed to leave on time.</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, I'll make sure to leave immediately," Taiga replied before he closed the book and wanted to put it back into the shelf.</p><p>"If you want to take it home with you then please feel free to do so," the elderly man told him, but Taiga shook his head.</p><p>"I like reading here. I'll come back for it."</p><p>It wasn't a lie, yet the only reason he had already been reading in the city's library for three days straight was to stay away from his parents' continuing marriage talks. He had of course agreed to join the ball, what else was he supposed to answer anyway?</p><p>Yet he had made them believe that for educational purposes he wanted to study more about trading and politics before it. And of course his parents had been more than happy about his idea. In the end he had ended up reading other books. The one he had found today was about the adventures of a man called Robinson Crusoe and Taiga felt kind of jealous while he of course didn't want to be thrown into the same dangerous adventure of survival, the freedom he could feel from the story made him feel even more like a prisoner in his own family.</p><p>At nighttime it was getting colder so Taiga threw his long coat over his white blouse. He hated most of his clothes. All of them were uncomfortable and showing off their noblemen status. So he usually tried to keep it at simple white clothes, black boots and the darkest coat he had when he walked around the city. Without any delay he walked up towards the long main street from where their house was already visible on the small hill before the mountain range.</p><p>When he looked around he could see families preparing their houses for the night. Mother's lighting candles, men closing the heavy wooden windows. It all looked so simple, no maids, no high class interior or fancy entrance halls. The simple things always made Taiga jealous, yet he knew that everyone would laugh at him if he voiced those thoughts out, so he never did.</p><p>There was a tavern on his way as well and he could hear people cheering and shouting from far away already and he dared to take a peek inside the lively place.</p><p>"Hey handsome, want to come in?" He was greeted at the entrance by a lady who was dressed in a way, which would make his mother freak on the spot that was for sure.</p><p>"Maybe some other time," Taiga politely declined, yet the woman took him by the arm and pulled him a bit more inside the tavern.</p><p>"Oh come on, just one drink. Or are we still too young for drinks?" The woman asked teasingly and while Taiga wasn’t that young and also had his good share of drinks at some of his father’s meetings and balls, he was a bit hesitant as it was already late and his mother would definitely scold him if he came home drunk, yet exactly that though made him change his mind and follow inside. He was tired of playing by everyone’s rules.</p><p>"Wait here, the first drink goes on the house," the woman said with a wink and vanished to the counter.</p><p>"Hey young noblemen, how about you pay a round for all of us?" A man on another table shouted, but he didn't sound offensive or threatening, just quite drunk.</p><p>"How about I do so if you win a challenge against me?" Taiga offered and the excitement about daring to talk to a stranger in the first place made him fear that he'd go against all rules his father had ever put up. But recently he had somehow started rebelling without realizing what the trigger was.</p><p>"Interesting. Then what is the challenge?" The man asked and sat down at Taiga's table when the woman brought Taiga his first drink.</p><p>"A drinking game," Taiga challenged. "And a rhythm game at the same time."</p><p>"So the loser pays for all the drinks we used for the game?" The man asked.</p><p>"And a full round for everyone present," Taiga added, making the room cheer.</p><p>"I'm in," the man said with a big laugh and Taiga gave him a challenging smile.</p><p>"Then let's see if you have any rhythm."</p><p>***</p><p>The man had actually done quite a good job at the game, but Taiga had won in the end and didn't need to spend any money. Three things had happened though. First he had ended up drunk and now he cursed himself for that, because he wasn't sure if he could hide it when he made it home. Second, it had become extremely late and he would definitely get scolded and third he had gotten so excited in his own game that he had ended up shattering a glass and cutting his hand, again…</p><p>Nevertheless he carried a light smile as he left the busy part of the city behind him. His parents would be so disappointed in him and somehow he suddenly wanted them to see him this way. Their oh so perfect son, not being that perfect anymore.</p><p>For a moment Taiga stopped as he looked ahead towards his house, the lights still on in some rooms. What would happen if he just didn't go back home? Just the thought of it and the actual thrill he felt through his own idea made him land a tiny bit back in reality and he shook his head.</p><p>"Others would give everything to have your status and yet you behave like this," Taiga scolded himself before he looked up into the night sky and took a deep breath, closing his eyes.</p><p>When he felt ready to finally make it home he lowered his head again, yet when he opened his eyes, the view to his house was blocked. Right in front of him and he wondered why he hadn't jumped and squealed this time? All he did was blink a few times before he formed a playful smile and threw his arms around Hokuto who had once more appeared way too suddenly.</p><p>"There you are," Taiga chirped. Hokuto didn't reply, but he also didn't complain when the other one hugged him. Yet he still looked a bit confused when the other one pulled back with his playful behavior.</p><p>"What are you doing here so late?" Taiga asked as if he had just met an old friend in town after a while and forgot that Hokuto usually seemed to wander around at night.</p><p>"I came to look for you," Hokuto said and first Taiga felt extremely grateful, but then Hokuto looked down at his hand.</p><p>"Wait, is this again about my blood? Come on, as if you could have known that I cut my hand."</p><p>"I didn't know," Hokuto let out. "At least not where you got hurt."</p><p>Taiga snorted on Hokuto's words, but he was still happy to see the other one.</p><p>"But today your blood smells a bit off," Hokuto explained and tilted his head. "As seem you."</p><p>This time Taiga burst out laughing and threw his arm around Hokuto's shoulder as he wanted to walk back with him towards the tavern, because why not, right?</p><p>"Oh come on as if you've never been drunk? Let's hang out now that you're here."</p><p>First Hokuto didn't seem to mind, but when they walked closed to the still lively part of the city, Taiga suddenly stopped.</p><p>"You know what, never mind. Come with me," Taiga said and took the other one by the wrist, pulling him away from the main street.</p><p>His carefree state had almost made him do something extremely dumb. First of all Hokuto didn't like light so the bright shops and taverns weren't a place he'd appreciate. The main problem was still Hokuto's eyes. Taiga had become used to them, but how would the people of his city react? He didn't want to find out.</p><p>"Let's hang out here," Taiga said as he released Hokuto and showed him the river flowing at the side of their city. There were no lights around here, but with the moonlight they could still see enough. Taiga sat down on the grass next to the river and that was when he realized how dizzy he actually felt. With a sigh he dropped to the back and closed his eyes for a moment. When he almost fell asleep he fought himself back up. Now Hokuto was sitting next to him, looking ahead at the river with an absentminded look.</p><p>"Sorry for dragging you along," Taiga finally said, but Hokuto didn't seem to mind. But that was also the problem. He didn't seem to mind anything or enjoy anything in the first place.</p><p>"Why are you living up there all alone?" Taiga asked and now he was thankful for being drunk, because he knew that he'd usually never ask so straight forward.</p><p>"It's a place where I feel safe," Hokuto replied.</p><p>"So it's your home?"</p><p>"I guess so?"</p><p>Taiga fell silent for a moment and tried to remember everything he had been told. "You said you slept for a long time. You don't know if your house is really your home. Hokuto, could it be that you lost your memory in some happening at that house?"</p><p>It made sense, didn't it? The house had been turned upside down and no one else was there while Hokuto seemed extremely confused about himself.</p><p>"Could be."</p><p>"Don't you want to find out?"</p><p>"How?" Hokuto asked and turned to the other one and for once Taiga saw a tiny bit of emotion as if Hokuto had actually hoped for someone to help him find out.</p><p>Taiga thought about it for a moment and then he formed a bright smile. "I've an idea. Meet me here tomorrow evening at the same time?"</p><p>"Sure," Hokuto let out casually and now Taiga suddenly felt like he had found a really good reason to keep up his noblemen behavior in front of his parents as good as possible.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga had waited a bit longer before going home. He had tried to be as sober as possible and luckily the lie he had come up with had been perfectly working out. He had pretended that he had been in the library for so long that he had fallen asleep and accidentally thrown the gas lamp off the table when he woke up and realized that his parents would worry for him.</p><p>Instead of scolding him, they were proud of the energy he was putting in and as the highest noblemen in town his father was allowed to get access to all buildings at all hours. So for the next evening Taiga had gotten the keys for the library so that the librarian wouldn't need to stay with him and that was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>"This one is way bigger than the one at my place," Hokuto said as Taiga had brought him towards their huge city library, but he had of course made sure to turn off the main lights. He only had one small gas lamp as Hokuto was okay with that. "But how can this place help us?"</p><p>"Follow me," Taiga said and made it through some of the long shelf rows towards the back of the room. Then he stopped in front of a shelf where a lot of older books and also rolls were placed.</p><p>"This section is about the history of this area. So I thought maybe we can find out something about the past happenings here?"</p><p>"Worth a try I guess?" Hokuto said.</p><p>"Can you read in the dark?" Taiga asked as he put the gas lamp on the side of the table, a bit away from Hokuto.</p><p>"You can't?" Hokuto asked and the confusion on his face made Taiga smile.</p><p>"I prefer my small light, but feel free to read wherever you want."</p><p>Taiga took out a few books from the shelf and went back to the table. To his surprise Hokuto also took a few and sat on the opposite side of the table.</p><p>It was the first time Taiga could get a closer look at the other one. Black wavy hair, pale skin, strong cheekbones. The silver eyes didn't seem that threatening to him in the light anymore. The boy himself didn't seem at all threatening since their second encounter and Taiga hoped that they could actually find out what had happened, because he really wanted to know more about Hokuto.</p><p>***</p><p>All of Taiga's efforts had been good for nothing the next evening though when his father had invited guests without telling him and so he hadn't been allowed to leave for the library and it would be suspicious if he begged too much, because he was officially just studying on his own.</p><p>He tried his best to not keep looking at the huge wooden clock in their living room, but the noise the pendulum made didn't help him calm down.</p><p>Hours after he had been supposed to meet with Hokuto he finally was able to retreat to his room after their guests had left. In panic he walked up and down the room. What if Hokuto was angry? What if he wasn't going to come anymore?</p><p>For a moment he thought about getting out of the window to make it over to the library, but it was already hours too late, would Hokuto really still be waiting? Yet Taiga didn't know how else he could contact him.</p><p>"Contacting him, right…" Taiga let out, realizing that there was indeed a chance to call Hokuto over. Now that the house had fallen silent he could risk it. He ran for his desk and got the paper knife out before he opened the door to the blacony. First he put the blade on his hand, but then he looked down at the still fresh bandage and realized that his hands had taken too much damage already and he got tired of explaining why. So he moved up his shirt and didn't hesitate to open a cut on the side of his hip.</p><p>For minutes he kept staring into the night, waiting for any kind of movement. Yet he couldn't spot anything.</p><p>"Would have been too easy," Taiga let out in disappointment.</p><p>"What would have been?"</p><p>This time Taiga jolted on the voice and when he swirled around Hokuto was standing right behind him with a calm expression. Taiga punched the other one on the chest, making Hokuto tilt his head in confusion.</p><p>"Dude, can you stop this?"</p><p>"Stopping what?"</p><p>"Sneaking up on me."</p><p>"But I wasn't," Hokuto replied and Taiga flicked his tongue, yet he needed to watch out that they weren't too loud.</p><p>"Whatsoever, let's get inside."</p><p>Hokuto followed and Taiga left the curtains open so that he didn't have to lid a lamp and when he sat on his bed, Hokuto remained at the door, but Taiga pointed at the bed.</p><p>"Won't you sit down?"</p><p>On the question, Hokuto did sit down, but Taiga felt like the boy behaved more like a nobleman than he did himself.</p><p>"Come on, relax," Taiga said and hit the other one on the shoulder, pointing at his legs as he was sitting way too stiff.</p><p>Hokuto got the hint and crawled more on the bed, sitting cross legged.</p><p>"Are you angry?" Taiga finally dared to ask.</p><p>"Why would I?"</p><p>"Because I didn't come."</p><p>"I knew you were busy at home," Hokuto replied and it didn't seem at all like he was angry.</p><p>As so often when Hokuto said something Taiga couldn't make sense of he just shook it off and nodded, but he didn't want the same to happen again.</p><p>"So, you came tonight because you smelled my blood, right?" Taiga asked, still wondering about that, but who was he to question someone with silver eyes. Hokuto only nodded and that made Taiga come up with an idea.</p><p>"We still have lots of books to go through so the next time I'll go to the library I'll let you know with my blood, okay?"</p><p>"Sure, that works for me," Hokuto said and wanted to get up.</p><p>"You don't have to leave. It's still not getting bright outside."</p><p>Taiga was almost laughing at his own words. He had adapted to the boy's behavior so easily.</p><p>"But don't you need to sleep?"</p><p>It was the one moment in which Taiga thought that Hokuto was way too cute for his scary appearance when he realized that he was missing the point.</p><p>"I can stay up a bit longer if you don't need to leave?"</p><p>"I can stay until the morning," Hokuto let out and Taiga moved closer in excitement.</p><p>"Oh wait, my dad bought me new books, shall we look through them? They are no history books, but as I know my father they might be similar to the ones you were reading at your place."</p><p>Hokuto nodded while Taiga got the bag with the unopened books his father had gotten as presents for him. Not that his father had handpicked them. All he did was asking at the bookstore in one of the huge cities he traveled to, to pack some recommendations for his son.</p><p>Just the excitement about being able to spend some time with Hokuto even with his parents present gave Taiga that excited feeling again. Breaking the rules had become his most dangerous hobby and he could only hope that it won't backfire.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga woke up through a knock on his door and a maid entered seconds later. First Taiga just rolled around in his bed, obviously not getting enough sleep, but when his hand landed on a pile of books his eyes widened and he shot up.</p><p>"Everything okay young lord?" The maid asked as she opened the curtains and bright daylight filled the room. First Taiga looked around the room, but as expected Hokuto wasn't there anymore. At some point Taiga had fallen asleep so the other one must have left.</p><p>"Everything is alright," Taiga said and the maid left again after telling him to get ready for breakfast as his parents were waiting for him.</p><p>Taiga grabbed a few of the books which had fallen off the bed and while putting them back on the shelf he had to smile at some of them.</p><p>Hokuto had started reading some of them in random order on random pages and he kept asking Taiga about the storylines. He had done the same about their history books in the library and Taiga wondered if they would be able to do something about Hokuto's lost memory.</p><p>When Taiga wanted to get ready he spotted a book that had most likely ended up under the bed when they had gone through the books to decide what to read. Taiga looked at the title, but it was a word he had never seen before. Randomly he opened a page and started reading.</p><p>Another knock on his door made him snap out of it and he realized that he had ended up reading for several minutes as he had found a book that weirdly resembled reality more than it should, after all this was fiction, right?</p><p>For now Taiga put it back on the shelf and hurried to get dressed, but he would definitely get back to that book in the evening.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Two days past without Taiga being able to make it to the library, but when he was finally able to go he hurried to the river and while he had opened a cut on his skin without hesitation before he halted this time. Until now he had made fun out of Hokuto saying he could tell when he was hurt, because there was no way, right? But now he was clenching the book in his other hand. He had ended up reading it not just once, but twice over the last few days and now he felt like he was the one going crazy.</p><p>Nevertheless he finally cut the skin on his upper arm. This time he waited quite a while and sat at the riverbank until once more Hokuto just appeared out of nowhere, but this time he had made sure to approach from the front and make himself noticeable from afar.</p><p>"You're getting better at this," Taiga joked and Hokuto returned a sheepish smile. It was still rare to see emotions on Hokuto's face so each time he showed him even the faintest smile, Taiga felt more than happy.</p><p>"A new book?" Hokuto asked as he pointed at the book Taiga was holding.</p><p>First Taiga wasn't sure if he should talk about the book, but then again why had he brought it then? Was he actually afraid of this fiction being true?</p><p>With a deep breath Taiga lifted the book up and showed it to Hokuto.</p><p>"It might sound weird, but I feel like some parts of this book resemble your situation so I thought we might see if other parts also apply to you?"</p><p>Hokuto took the book from him and put his fingers on the title. "The Vampyre?"</p><p>Taiga nodded with a confident look as he wanted to clarify that this book was really just fiction.</p><p>"What's a Vampyre?" Hokuto asked and looked for the author, but it said it was written anonymously so they had no one to go to and actually ask about the book.</p><p>"That's what we're going to find out, come on," Taiga said and urged him to head to the library where they sat down with the book. Taiga had marked the pages he wanted to talk about with Hokuto and so they started reading.</p><p>"So it mentions people similar to humans, but they only walk around at night and they move around like shadows and it also says something about beast looking eyes."</p><p>"Do I look like a beast?" Hokuto asked and Taiga immediately felt bad for saying it, but it was part of the book after all.</p><p>"I just thought it's similar, not all of it is the same. I think your eyes are unusual, but they also have something stunning."</p><p>This time Hokuto's look brightened up again and Taiga felt all warm through the excited look he got from the other one.</p><p>"It says something about fangs though, do I have fangs?" Hokuto asked and the way he opened his mouth to let Taiga look at his teeth, made Taiga slightly chuckle.</p><p>"Well, you have small fangs? Not sure if they mean those?" Taiga said and Hokuto just shrugged his shoulders while he kept reading, but then he slowed down and Taiga remained silent and started twiddling his fingers as he knew which part Hokuto was reading.</p><p>"What do you think?" Taiga asked as Hokuto put the book down with a hard to interpret look.</p><p>"Would this be human?" Hokuto asked, but Taiga didn't want to reply so he dropped to the back of his chair with a chair and slowly shook his head.</p><p>"No it wouldn't. Especially because it says that they kill through it."</p><p>"Good that it's fiction then," Hokuto said and kept skipping to the next marked page while Taiga kept staring back at the other one.</p><p>Had he just shook off Taiga's biggest worry? But why had he asked about it then? The use of the fangs was something Taiga had panicked about especially after he had read the part where they get closer to their 'pray' through the smell of blood.</p><p>Taiga wanted to shake it off and just see it as the fiction it was, but for now he wanted to at least keep checking the rest of the book, which sounded even more ridiculous to him, but at least not that dangerous.</p><p>"So I brought some things for that part of the book," Taiga said and put a small metal bottle and a necklace with a cross on the table.</p><p>Hokuto raised an eyebrow at that and Taiga was so close to bursting out laughing. "You didn't bring a wooden stake to see if I die if you pierce me with it, did you?"</p><p>When Taiga pulled his bag closer to actually have a look he finally burst out laughing this time on Hokuto's scandalized expression.</p><p>"No I didn't bring one so calm down," Taiga said while he tried to calm down his laughter, but had to brush away some tears.</p><p>Taiga was sure that eventually this night would just become a ridiculous memory for both of them, but he still felt kind of relieved that Hokuto had reacted that calmly about the book.</p><p>***</p><p>"You're in such a good mood, are you looking forward to the ball that much?" Taiga's mother asked when Taiga skipped down the stairs the next morning when they were leaving for the ball.</p><p>Taiga just nodded and made her believe that he was indeed looking forward to that ridiculous ball and enjoyed wearing those embarrassing clothes, which made him look like a dressed up doll.</p><p>While his parents just enjoyed his good mood, Taiga kept grinning to himself in silence as he remembered the fun evening with Hokuto. In the end they had both kept laughing at all the things Taiga had brought with him and Hokuto had even let him try out some just for fun.</p><p>Eventually Taiga had to tell him that he wouldn't be there for a good week, but he had promised to let him know when he was back in town and Hokuto seemed extremely excited about it.</p><p>"You said you wanted to go to the bookstore, right?" His father asked when they were in the carriage for quite a while already and Taiga nodded.</p><p>"I still have some book left to read, but there are some special ones I want to look for."</p><p>"He's studying so hard," his mother said proudly to her husband, yet Taiga only smiled, not telling them that the books he was looking for were definitely not what they would approve of.</p><p>Nevertheless he found himself in the fictional corner of the bookstore when he was finally allowed to roam the streets of the city by himself as his parents were busy with official business anyway.</p><p>Unfortunately Taiga had only found two books, which seemed similar to the one he had read with Hokuto and their city's library didn't even have such books in the first place. After a moment he wondered if Hokuto's library didn't have any books about his past or his kind. Because their city library hadn't given them any answers about what might have happened twenty five years ago. Which was also a bit fishy, because there were records dating back hundreds of years yet the past twenty to fifty years weren't showing anything extraordinary at all.</p><p>"Any specific book you're looking for?" The elderly man who was the bookstore owner asked as Taiga kept looking at the shelves in a loss.</p><p>"Not exactly," Taiga said and didn't want to ask too obviously. "I recently got a book called The Vampyre as a present and wondered if there were similar ones."</p><p>Like this he hoped he wouldn't sound too desperate and the man nodded with a knowing smile as he walked towards another shelf and pulled one more book for him after he had seen which ones he was already holding on to.</p><p>"This one might be of your liking then," the owner said and Taiga took the book. "The man-wolf?"</p><p>Well Hokuto was obviously not a wolf, but he could still see if there were any similarities in this story.</p><p>Eventually he ended up buying books about supernatural topics and a handful of political books to make his father believe that he went only to get those.</p><p>The ball got in his way of reading though and he tried to pretend to have fun, but at some point he got more than tired of all the new faces and all the introductions of people's daughters.</p><p>"Father, can I ask you something?" Taiga finally tried his luck when the evening had calmed down and his father had another champagne glass in his hand.</p><p>"Of course, what is it?"</p><p>"I recently stumbled over a few history books in the library while studying and I wondered if we have some books about the recent history of our city. I couldn't find much and even the librarian said there was not much literature about those years.</p><p>His father just nodded for a moment and Taiga wondered if the timing for the question had been bad after all.</p><p>"It's not like anything interesting happened in the times of your grandfather so I guess they didn’t have much to write down?"</p><p>Such a harmless reply, right? And for now Taiga only nodded, because he didn't want to be too obvious, but he remembered that his grandfather died at a young age when his father had been barely an adult and if he remembered correctly then that was around the time Hokuto said he had fallen asleep. So now he had to do even more research, but he already knew where to start.</p><p>***</p><p>"So no library today?" Hokuto asked when Taiga had almost jumped at him after they had finally made it back home and Taiga hurried to the river. Without even questioning Hokuto's ability by now he had opened a cut on his skin and waited. Of course the other one showed up, something Taiga was sure of by now.</p><p>He had immediately started pulling him away from the city this time and kept talking about the books he had gotten.</p><p>"I just wanted to test something from the book," Taiga said and finally stopped at an open field close to the mountains.</p><p>"Okay so what now?" Hokuto asked, but Taiga looked up at the clouds for a moment before he finally let out a satisfied sound.</p><p>"Here we go, just a few more seconds."</p><p>Hokuto looked up to find the full moon breaking through the clouds and he kept looking at it for a moment longer until he realized that Taiga kept staring at him.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Any change? Do you feel anything while looking at it?"</p><p>Hokuto looked back at the moon and then nodded to Taiga's obvious surprise.</p><p>"It's bright so it annoys my eyes," Hokuto replied completely serious and after another moment Taiga burst out laughing.</p><p>"You're unbelievable, but like this one more of my books didn't really show any connection, only your eyes seemed similar to the story in the first place. But now I feel like I've run out of things to try."</p><p>"How about we read through my library next?" Hokuto offered. "You just have to bring your own lamp."</p><p>The way Hokuto even remembered such small things made Taiga smile at him once more.</p><p>"My parents will be away over the weekend so I can sneak out in the evening and make it up to your place."</p><p>The way up to Hokuto's place wasn't easy, but Taiga was looking forward to going back as they definitely had more privacy at his place.</p><p>"Also my father told me that we don't have many recent records of the time when you said you fell asleep," Taiga remembered.</p><p>"I guess that's another mystery we have to solve then," Hokuto said shrugging his shoulders, but somehow his look showed that he wasn't taking it as neutral as he wanted Taiga to believe.</p><p>Without any hesitation Taiga stepped closer and took the other one's hand in his and gave it a light squeeze.</p><p>"I really hope we can figure out what exactly happened, but…"</p><p>"But what?" Hokuto asked when Taiga didn't continue and looked away with a troubled expression.</p><p>"What if it's something so bad that you don't even want to remember and that's why you forgot it in the first place?"</p><p>The chances of that were high after all. His house was a mess, no path leading up to his house in the first place so no one had even bothered with that place for who knew how many years and what if…what if his father was lying to him? It was something he had thought about a lot recently.</p><p>"Then I guess I will regret it at that point, but I don't feel like just going back to sleep."</p><p>Hokuto's words made Taiga squeeze his hand even more this time. "Please don't go back to sleep. And even if what we find out is something horrible, please don't just leave, okay?"</p><p>Of course Hokuto nodded, because why would he leave Taiga's side through whatever happened in his past? It wasn’t something Taiga was at fault for.</p><p>***</p><p>With outstretched arms Taiga let out a loud yawn, making Hokuto look up from one of his books.</p><p>"Maybe you should leave for tonight? Someone will definitely realize that you sneaked out if you're not back by sunrise."</p><p>Hokuto had a good point, yet Taiga shook his head. It was still in the middle of the night after all. But he had to remember that the path back was difficult and would take him a few hours.</p><p>"Your books are complicated to read, that's all," Taiga said as he closed another book. This library had books he had never seen before, even the letters were different and it took him some time to read.</p><p>"But you're having fascinating books, yet a lot of them don't have any author name," Taiga added as he got up and used the ladder to get up to the higher shelves. "It's like all knowledge of humanity is on these shelves."</p><p>"More like knowledge about humanity," Hokuto whispered and Taiga leant back as he couldn't hear him well, but at the same time the wooden step he was standing in broke as it had been brittle from all the years it hadn't been used. With a gasp Taiga tried to reach out for the front of the ladder, but couldn't get a grip on it in time so he prepared for a really painful landing on the wooden floor. Yet after he had closed his eyes and waited for the impact, his fall was abruptly stopped and that way faster and smoother than he had thought. When he dared to open his eyes again he came eye to eye with Hokuto who had caught him.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"Yes- I'm fine…how…" Taiga looked over to the armchair in which Hokuto had been sitting like a second ago and it was on the other side of the room.</p><p>"How what?" Hokuto asked, but Taiga slowly shook his head.</p><p>"Never mind, thank you."</p><p>By now he shouldn't even be confused by weird happenings around the boy, but after another moment he hawked awkwardly, making Hokuto look at him questioningly.</p><p>"Would you mind letting me down?"</p><p>"Right," Hokuto let out, for the first time a slightly embarrassed look on his face.</p><p>Taiga turned away with the same expression, but his feet still felt a bit unstable after his sudden fall. In front of him one book had dropped out of the shelf and while Hokuto walked back to his armchair and pretended as if nothing had happened, Taiga picked up the black book. The book didn't seem as old as a lot of the others and the letters looked more like the ones he was used to.</p><p>"Do you mind if I bring back some books to my place?"</p><p>Hokuto didn't mind as they couldn't meet at his place all the time, because Taiga wouldn't be able to sneak out nonstop.</p><p>Yet Taiga wished he could find an excuse to stay with Hokuto for more than just a few hours once in a while.</p><p>***</p><p>"So I saw that you talked a lot to the young lady of Clifford."</p><p>Taiga just nodded on his mother's words, because he had indeed tried to be as polite as possible at the ball a week ago, but of course his parents would misinterpret that politeness as interest. Yet for now he just left it at that.</p><p>"Are you planning on going to the library today?" His father asked as he put down his fork, but Taiga shook his head.</p><p>"I'll take a break for a few days. I want to be a bit more outside, around town, maybe also exploring a bit around the area by horse."</p><p>Taiga waited for his parents to decline that request, but to his surprise they didn't. Yet Taiga was sure that if he really said he wanted to explore that one or two of their guards would be with him.</p><p>"It's definitely a good decision to also be more around the people for once in a while."</p><p>"I actually also talked to some on my way back from the library recently," Taiga said, taking the chance he saw.</p><p>"You mean when you sneaked back inside drunk?"</p><p>His mother's words made him blush a bit as his mother had of course realized and while he had thought he had done a good job in lying that night, he had gotten a big round of scolding from his mother the next day.</p><p>"That one time as well, yes," Taiga said in a low voice, but then turned to his father.</p><p>"I heard stories about our city. Yet I couldn't find anything about it in our library so I thought they just made them up?"</p><p>Taiga tried to sound excited, but he chose every word carefully and finally he saw some change on his father's face.</p><p>"And what kind of stories were they?"</p><p>"Kind of mysterious ones," Taiga explained, knowing that all his words were lies, but he wanted to see his father's reaction without bringing Hokuto into danger. "Something about creatures of the night with silver eyes and something about human blood."</p><p>Taiga tried to keep his voice as carefree as possible, as if he was telling an exciting fairytale. He waited a moment and both his parents had fallen quiet and Taiga didn't miss the way his mother looked up at his father.</p><p>"I read similar things in some fictional books recently, so I guess some of the town's men just got carried away with their fantasy, but if people like that really existed then that would be scary, right?"</p><p>"They are no people."</p><p>Taiga wanted to laugh his own words off yet his father's reply took him off guard and he stared back at him dumbfounded.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Taiga asked as his father remained silent, but then his mother put her glass down a bit too forcefully, making his father snap out of whatever kind of serious mood he had fallen into. With a laugh he turned to Taiga.</p><p>"I mean they are talking about characters in a book, right? People like to take those stories and make them their own. But they are not described as normal people in the books, are they? I read some myself, interesting fairytales for sure."</p><p>Taiga laughed it off with his father, but now he was sure that not just his father but the entire city was hiding something.</p><p>***</p><p>After spending the nights at the library, then having the travel and the ball and eventually spending the night at Hokuto's place, Taiga had been too exhausted to stay up to read, yet on the second day he finally sat down on the balcony when the sun was slowly vanishing behind the trees of the highest mountain range.</p><p>This book had nothing supernatural at first glance, but the history parts of it sounded so different from their library books. As if they had been written from another perspective.</p><p>
  <em>Greed made them desire what they couldn't have and our gift wasn't one to share with them. Centuries of war hadn't changed them and instead of finding a way to live alongside each other they kept trying to reach for a superiority that wouldn't be gained to such an ignorant race.</em>
</p><p>Taiga read the book with the same excitement as he did with the recent ones, yet he was confused about a lot of the content. This was supposed to be a history book, right? Events he knew were written down in it and names of cities and people were familiar to him, but on the other hand a lot sounded like fiction again.</p><p>
  <em>As if hunting animals they tried to find the right weapons, yet human weapons wouldn't be effective on a superior race like ours, no matter how much they wanted to believe in their religion and fairytales.</em>
</p><p>Once more Taiga shook his head. Whoever wrote this book was either exaggerating in a weird way or there was really finally something that gave him a lead to Hokuto's identity. He kept flipping through the pages, trying to find the time around twenty to thirty years ago.</p><p>
  <em>This hadn't been a war, nor a battle. It had been a massacre without any kind of reason. Never even once had we engaged with them if not threatened first, yet they came to slay us all. With fire, swords and poison they used brutal force to try and take their place as kings of this world. Yet we will never vanish and they will find their doom when the time is right. Humanity will pay with their blood for their sins.</em>
</p><p>With wide eyes Taiga kept looking at the next page as there was a list of noblemen written down. Those who had launched the attacks, who had lead a cowardly massacre out of fear over several cities and one name caught his attention as it was none other than the one of his grandfather.</p><p>***</p><p>Not even exactly knowing why, Taiga didn't go to Hokuto's place or asked him to come over for several days after he had finished the book. They had been looking for answers, right? They were right here in front of him and even from Hokuto's house library. With all the books it wasn't that weird that Hokuto hadn't read the book yet as he also had lost his memories obviously, but there had been something in that book which could actually help with exactly that problem, yet Taiga suddenly felt as if he was at fault for Hokuto's state.</p><p>"Young lord, do you need anything else?" The maid asked when Taiga was sitting alone at the desk in his room, staring down at the book in front of him. It didn't look like a suspicious book so he didn't hide it as long as it wasn't his parents coming in, but they were luckily out for business the entire day already.</p><p>"Thank you, but everything is taken care of," Taiga said and the maid excused herself. That was the moment Taiga finally stepped out of his room and went up to the third floor of their house. A place he usually never went to as his grandparents' quarters had been up there. But of course there were more rooms and his father had always told him that they were storage and guest rooms so he wasn't supposed to play around on the third floor as a kid and as he had never met his grandparents he never felt the urge to go up there. The few times he did, he remembered that the doors were always locked and his father had scolded him for going up there.</p><p>Another skill Taiga had picked up from all the books was lock picking so this time he was prepared for closed doors.</p><p>The bedroom of his late grandparents looked as expected, the furniture hung up with white blankets and nothing suspicious caught Taiga's eye.</p><p>The next room seemed indeed like a guest room so Taiga locked that one once more and went on to the third and last room.</p><p>A meeting room, with a big table and a good dozen chairs around it. Taiga slowly went around it and looked at the shelves.</p><p>Maps of the city and mountains around. Locations marked with crosses while Taiga had never seen more than thick forest at those places. Even other cities more than a few days ride away were marked. But then his look fell on one red cross and he realized in shock that it was Hokuto's house.</p><p>"What nonsense made you do this," Taiga whispered as he looked through even more of the papers and a lot of them reminded him of what he had read in Hokuto’s book, yet he also stumbled over things he had read in fictional books.</p><p>Times when the sun would rise and set, papers from the church and drawings of crosses.</p><p>When Taiga stepped next to another shelf the wood underneath his feet made a dangerous noise and he stepped back, fearing to break through the flooring. When he looked closer he realized that the wood had been cut in several parts and he hurried to take a paper knife from the table and try to loosen the wood. He wasn't surprised when it actually came off and revealed a box underneath.</p><p>A little bit hesitant, Taiga took it out and put the dusty brown box on the table. When he tried to open it he pulled back with a hiss as he cut himself on a sharp part of the metal buckles.</p><p>The pain was forgotten though when he opened the box and realized what was in it.</p><p>"This is ridiculous," Taiga said under his breath as he took out a hammer with a golden cross on it and next to it was a wooden stake. Taiga had read about them of course, yet it had all been fictional and he had laughed about it with Hokuto. So why were all these things in this box? A gun with silver bullets, holy water from the church, a cross, a mirror and so many other ridiculous things.</p><p>"What madness made you create such a box?" Taiga asked himself.</p><p>"One you luckily never have to experience thanks to them."</p><p>Taiga dropped the hammer on the sound of his father's voice. He had taken too much time, not thinking he would be back so soon. But now he could at least directly ask.</p><p>"You knew about this?" Taiga asked calmly, not even apologizing for sneaking into the room.</p><p>"I was around your age when my father started holding meetings here. But I've seen what they fought against. They were the brave men of that time to protect us. So that your generation could live in calmer and safer times."</p><p>"You said there was nothing worth writing a history book about so why was this never noted down?"</p><p>"Because no one would believe it anyway," his father said honestly. "Yet I wonder. Son, is there a reason behind you suddenly wanting to know so much about the past?"</p><p>Taiga bit his lip on that question as he couldn't possibly tell him, especially after he had had no time to talk to Hokuto about all of this.</p><p>His father let out a sigh on his son's silence and slowly nodded. "I fear if you can't be honest with me I need to make sure that you're not having other secrets."</p><p>"What is that supposed to mean?"</p><p>"From now on I'll put a guard at your side and you're not allowed outside the house alone anymore."</p><p>"You can't do that," Taiga replied, raising his voice a bit too much.</p><p>"Then tell me why you decided to come up here and I'll take care of it."</p><p>Take care of it. The realization of what his father was saying made Taiga realize that he could never be honest with him. They had their secrets and he had his, but one side was misunderstanding something and he wasn't sure which one it was. In anger he closed his fists and was reminded of the cut on his finger. That also made him look up once more, but he looked past his father into the corridor.</p><p>"So I guess we will need to have a talk later," his father said, not realizing yet that silver shining eyes were watching them from the corridor.</p><p>"Are you two upstairs?" His mother was heard from the stairs, but the next moment everything escalated as Hokuto had no place to vanish to and she spotted his eyes looking down at her. She started screaming and his father swirled around, seeing Hokuto lingering in the dark.</p><p>"Taiga, get away," his father shouted and shoved him to the back, but the next moment he reached inside the box. Mirrors, crosses or holy water were no problem, Taiga knew that, but when his father drew the pistol out of the box Taiga panicked and reacted before he could even think about it.</p><p>"Don't! He won't do you any harm," Taiga shouted as he had ran to the door, yet his father had obviously not thought that he would protect the creature they were facing and with wide eyes his father looked at his son who he had just shot in his panic.</p><p>Taiga also looked back at him in shock, the pain somewhere in his body, yet his body was in too much shock to locate the wound. When he stumbled back he felt Hokuto's hands around his upper body.</p><p>"Release him!" His father shouted, but Taiga feared even more for Hokuto's life than his own.</p><p>"Get away," Taiga whispered, but Hokuto's grip tightened on him.</p><p>What happened after that would remain a mystery to Taiga as he could only pray that he wouldn’t die and only fall unconscious for now.</p>

  <p>When Taiga woke up he was in immense pain and when he opened his eyes and saw nothing but darkness he panicked and tried to sit up, but with a painful gasp he fell back. His hands looked for the source of pain and then he found it on his right ribs.</p><p>There was something on it, maybe a bandage, but it didn't seem like a doctor's work. After his eyes had finally adjusted to the darkness he realized that this was Hokuto's room.</p><p>"Hokuto? Are you there?" Taiga asked as he remembered what had happened and he looked for the silver eyes and finally he spotted them in a dark corner.</p><p>"You’re safe…" Taiga let out and dropped back on the bed, yet Hokuto didn't speak or approach him. "Why are you standing there?"</p><p>"I can't get closer right now."</p><p>Why did his voice sound darker than usual? He almost sounded as if he was in pain himself.</p><p>"Did my father attack you?" Taiga asked, but didn't try to get up as he knew that his wound would cause him even more pain. Hokuto's behavior also made him realize that he shouldn't get close to the other one. He wasn't even inside the room. He was standing in the corridor, so he wanted to give himself a way to back off and while Taiga wanted to ignore the reason for that he knew he couldn't any longer.</p><p>"I'm too fast for him to shoot me," Hokuto replied.</p><p>"Did you attack him?" He didn't want to ask, yet he needed to know.</p><p>"I had an escape route and your parents didn't stop me."</p><p>That was all he needed to know. Yet there was so much more they needed to talk about now.</p><p>"You still don't remember anything?" Taiga asked, but this time Hokuto didn't reply immediately.</p><p>"I know what you know," he finally let out. Right, once more Hokuto had found him bleeding and this time Taiga was sure that this was also the reason why he was keeping his distance.</p><p>"Is it the amount or is it because you can only stay patient for a certain amount of time?"</p><p>"Both," Hokuto honestly replied as he had already figured out his own identity through what Taiga had discovered in his parents’ house and the book. So even without all his memories he knew how dangerous he was to the other one right now.</p><p>"Are you afraid?"</p><p>That question hadn't even crossed Taiga's mind so he thought about it for a moment.</p><p>"I don't know," he eventually let out. "But you brought me here and I'm still alive so I guess for now I don't have to worry?"</p><p>"Do you want to go back home?"</p><p>"No." This time Taiga immediately replied and tried to sit up a bit to look at the other one as he knew that Hokuto could see him clearly even in the dark. "If I go back then I won't be able to see you again. We should also relocate!"</p><p>"Because of the map?" Hokuto said as he was aware that they knew the location of this house and it was the closest location on the map so maybe they would already be on their way. "I don't fear their ridiculous pitchforks, stakes or holy water."</p><p>"So you want to kill them if they come for me?"</p><p>"Shall I hand you back to them instead? Didn't you just say you don't want to go back?"</p><p>The situation was indeed more complicated than that, but Taiga wasn't in a state to come up with a detailed plan. The bullet might still be stuck in his body as every movement caused him a lot of pain and the bandages wouldn't stop the bleeding like that so eventually Hokuto would need to leave alone if he wanted to survive and if Taiga didn't want him to kill people from his city.</p><p>"Why did you bring me with you in the first place? Don't you hate me?"</p><p>Taiga's question made Hokuto step a bit closer to the door and he could see how the other one shook his head.</p><p>"Sins of the past or not the sins of the next generation. You never gave me a reason to hate you."</p><p>Hokuto's words brought a smile to Taiga's face, but when he realized that he could see Hokuto more clearly by now he panicked.</p><p>"Is it morning already?"</p><p>"It's dawn," Hokuto explained.</p><p>"That's bad. They will be here in no time. They did this last time as well, right? They came at day time. We need to leave."</p><p>"How am I supposed to leave?"</p><p>Taiga didn't reply, instead he finally sat up and gritted his teeth while he tried to pull the bandage closer around his body. With a hiss he got up from the bed and made it over to the door where Hokuto backed off.</p><p>"Sunlight is your weakness, I've read about it, you know it as well. But it won't kill you. I don't want you to kill anyone, but I also don't want to see you get harmed so let's get out. It will be painful for both of us, but there should be a place somewhere beyond the mountains where we can hide."</p><p>"I might know a place," Hokuto said. "It's like a faint memory so I can't promise that I will find the place, but I can try."</p><p>Taiga smiled once more at his words, but Hokuto gave him a questioning look.</p><p>"We might die out there if they catch up, why do you look so happy?"</p><p>"Because you give it a try. You don't stay even though you could easily kill them. You are listening to my request even though you don't need to."</p><p>Hokuto didn't say anything on that as he wasn't capable of having such emotional human talks. Yet he hurried to another room and threw a huge black cloak over his head.</p><p>"You need to walk on your own. In the daytime I can't carry you and I can't get close to you right now."</p><p>"It's alright, I will manage," Taiga promised, even though he wasn't sure if he could even walk for a mile without fainting, but he had to try. Hokuto was risking everything for him so he had to give it his best effort to rescue Hokuto as well.</p><p>***</p><p>As expected Taiga didn't last long and he broke down at some point, but he knew he had to get up himself even with the bandages already completely red and he could see how much Hokuto struggled to stay away.</p><p>The sun was hidden under heavy clouds, which made it easier for him, yet all his senses seemed to tell him even more to attack Taiga now that he was weakened himself and Taiga was the easiest prey.</p><p>"They will catch up," Hokuto said and looked up to the small mountain they had just left behind. “They brought the dogs. They will smell your blood."</p><p>"Then go on without me," Taiga finally said even though he didn't want to. "No matter how much I don't want to become the prisoner of my own family and never be allowed to see you again, I don't want you to suffer under them."</p><p>"For that it's too late now," Hokuto let out and now Taiga could also clearly hear the barking of the dogs.</p><p>With a groan he got up again, pressing his hand desperately against the side of his body and kept moving. Meter for meter he tried to keep going, but he knew that they weren't fast enough and then Hokuto stopped, making Taiga catch up to him, but he watched out to not walk right up to him.</p><p>"Why is there a river here?" Taiga asked as they arrived at a cliff with a fast flowing river several meters beneath them.</p><p>"As I said my memory is blurry and if it was night I would just jump over it."</p><p>A day ago Taiga would have laughed at him for saying that he could jump over such a wide river, yet he just nodded this time.</p><p>"Unfortunately night is way too far away for us now."</p><p>"Then fighting it is," Hokuto said and turned back, the dogs running past the hills now and soon torches got visible as well.</p><p>Taiga's father and a good dozen men from the city were with him. Swords, pistols and forks in their hands.</p><p>"You can still get away, can't you?" Taiga asked and looked down at the river.</p><p>"Maybe, but in the daytime I can't even say if I could survive a fall in this river."</p><p>"TAIGA, GET AWAY FROM HIM!" His father shouted from far away already, but to Taiga's surprise Hokuto immediately stepped in front of him. His silver shining eyes didn't lose any of their strong color even at daytime and some of the men slowed down on spotting him.</p><p>"You will die here," his father shouted at Hokuto and drew his pistol once more.</p><p>"You really want to risk that once more?" Hokuto asked and stepped a bit to the side so that Taiga was visible and his father looked worried as he saw Taiga's blood stained clothes, but it had been his own fault and he lowered the pistol as he couldn't be sure for now if he could aim right.</p><p>"Let's just get rid of him. He's just a boy," one of the men shouted and he and two others dashed to the front, but the next moment Hokuto made a step to the front and for the first time Taiga saw a different side of him as his hood slipped to the back and Hokuto revealed his fangs, his real fangs. With an animal like sound he hissed at the men who immediately stopped, one of them even falling to the back out of sheer panic.</p><p>"Truly a monster," Taiga's father spit at Hokuto, but the boy didn't attack him.</p><p>"As much as I've read, you were the monsters," Taiga interfered. "You killed his kind. Your own father killed them and you want to do the same now?"</p><p>"You don't know what you're talking about son. His kind doesn’t share bonds. They are like wild animals. Hunting in packs and killing our kind just because they feel superior."</p><p>"Lies," Hokuto hissed at him. "We don't kill if we don't have to. We only do what we need to do to survive."</p><p>"Feeding on human blood, doesn't sound quite human to me," another man shouted and threw his torch right at Hokuto, who lifted his arm to block it with his cloak, but unfortunately it caught on fire and he needed to throw it to the ground.</p><p>The others might have not noticed it, but Taiga could see how much Hokuto struggled in the daylight.</p><p>"If I go back with you, are you going to leave him alone?" Taiga asked.</p><p>"Why wouldn't you want to come with us? He kidnapped you. Because of him you're close to death," his father said.</p><p>"Hokuto isn't a monster. I want you to leave him alone."</p><p>"Hokuto?" His father said as he had finally realized that his son was well aware of the creature in front of him. "How long have you been aware of this monster?"</p><p>"Stop calling him that," Taiga yelled, but the next moment he folded to the front.</p><p>"You'll die if you stay with him," his father reminded him.</p><p>"I don't need a life with all your rules anyway," Taiga let out. For the first time speaking his mind, because he might not get another chance to. So even if his body slowly forced him down he didn't want to just give up like this. "If going back means that you'll just keep hunting Hokuto behind my back and won't allow me to see him again, then I will never go back with you. I don't need your money or the prestige of all those families you want me to marry into."</p><p>It was actually Hokuto's face that changed first and he gave Taiga a kind of proud look.</p><p>"I didn't know you could sound this fierce too," Hokuto said and somehow Taiga felt like blushing.</p><p>"So you'll give up your life for him?" One of the men asked, but then Hokuto laughed.</p><p>"Who said I'd let him die?"</p><p>Those words gave Taiga another strong push to get through his pain and he gave the other one an intense stare.</p><p>"Do you trust me?" Hokuto asked.</p><p>There was no hesitation in Taiga's eyes on that question so Hokuto turned back to the humans with a look Taiga had never seen. For the first time he indeed didn't look human.</p><p>"You want to fight us during the day?" One of the men asked and pulled his sword out, pointing it at Hokuto.</p><p>"Even without my full strength I'll be stronger than you," Hokuto threatened them and a few of them stepped back, but two of them jumped to the front. Yet Hokuto hadn't lied, he jumped at them without having trouble to fight them off. Yet Taiga could see that he was holding back for his sake. He didn't kill any of them. All he did was throw them around, ripping their weapons out of their hands and throwing them into the river.</p><p>Releasing the dogs at him hadn’t helped either, because he could easily scare them away with another hiss.</p><p>Yet a moment later the sunlight broke through the clouds and Hokuto started having trouble with his speed.</p><p>Taiga wished he could help, but he was barely able to keep standing and then he realized that his father had used Hokuto's distraction to make it over to him.</p><p>"He can't follow us with the sun out so we need to leave now."</p><p>His father reached out for his wrist, trying to make him follow him back towards the forest, but Taiga pulled his arm back.</p><p>"As if you would just leave him alone like this. Do you really think I would leave with him while the others try to kill him?"</p><p>"Taiga, you don't understand, he's-"</p><p>"He's not like us, yes. But did you or my grandfather ever consider trying to live alongside them?"</p><p>Taiga's words showed that they hadn't of course, because his father looked almost scandalized by that thought.</p><p>"So do you prefer to get killed by him or die while running away from him?"</p><p>"If the only other option is you killing him then yes," Taiga shouted at his father even though he found that scenario ridiculous. He dashed away from his father next, using his last strength to throw himself in front of Hokuto who had trouble fighting back with the sun fully out.</p><p>"Young Lord, please step aside. He's not worth your protection," one of the men said, but Taiga shook his head.</p><p>"That is something I'll decide myself so if you don't want me dead instead, you should leave."</p><p>But of course they wouldn't and soon Taiga stumbled to the back unable to keep standing. Hokuto caught him and of course Taiga's father gave him another hateful glare on that move.</p><p>"I can protect you, but I need you to fully trust me," Hokuto whispered.</p><p>"I told you before that I trust you," Taiga said and as if he already knew what Hokuto was asking for he let his head drop on the other one's shoulder, revealing his neck.</p><p>"Don't you dare!" Taiga's father shouted and got ready to attack once more with the others, but they were too slow and Hokuto once more hissed at them with his fangs out, but this time he buried them into Taiga's neck.</p><p>At first it only felt like needles piercing through Taigas skin, but after a few seconds he reached up for Hokuto's arms and clenched his fists into them as the skin on his neck felt like catching fire and he soon couldn't withstand the pain anymore and he sank to his knees, letting out a shuddering breath. Hokuto hadn't gone down with him and looked at the others in front of him instead.</p><p>"Last chance for you to retreat," Hokuto hissed in a low voice, but as the men didn't move he walked past Taiga, yet the boy reached out for Hokuto's arm with a weak touch.</p><p>"You promised to not kill them," Taiga reminded him and while he couldn't see the same carefree attitude from before in Hokuto's eyes anymore he felt like he could still believe in the boy's sanity as he nodded and squeezed Taiga's hand once.</p><p>"I promise you that no one will die today," Hokuto said and finally attacked.</p><p>Taiga tried to follow the fight and he was sure that Hokuto had the upper hand this time. Luckily it also seemed like he didn't aim to kill anyone. As he was outnumbered and the blood wouldn't restore his full power he started biting the others at some point, draining them more than Taiga so that they would fall unconscious.</p><p>When Hokuto went for Taiga's father the other men finally were frightened enough to run away, but Hokuto kept his promise and jumped back towards Taiga without anyone in a horrible condition.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>"More people will chase after you. No place on this world is safe for you," Taiga's father hissed as Hokuto had left him in a similar state as Taiga so he was conscious yet not able to get up again.</p><p>Hokuto lifted Taiga up from the ground and gave the man an indifferent look.</p><p>"This world belonged to us way sooner than to you. Don't act like you're the kings of this world," Hokuto warned him before he took a tighter grip on Taiga and while the boy didn't really clearly recognize his surroundings anymore he gasped when Hokuto jumped from the cliff down towards the river.</p><p>***</p><p>The next time Taiga woke up something felt horribly wrong. There was no way that he should feel in any way okay, yet he felt fine. Even better than fine. No pain of his wound, no headache or other uncomfortable feeling. When he sat up he immediately put his hand on his wound, which wasn't there anymore.</p><p>"What the hell…" Taiga whispered to himself and finally looked around the unfamiliar place. His room had windows, but it was dark outside. The walls were out of grey stone, candle holders on the walls and a heavy wooden door at the other side of the room. Even the bed looked more elegant than in his own house, yet also way older and pretty dusty.</p><p>Right, on that thought Taiga got up and put his own worries to the back for now. He hurried out of the room and he was greeted by a long corridor with expensive looking paintings on the wall. This was indeed no normal house, this was a castle, Taiga was sure of it. He had never heard of any remaining intact castle of the previous century so he wondered how far Hokuto had ran off with him.</p><p>There were several staircases, but Taiga remained on the same floor for now while he tried to find his way through the dark corridors until he found a huge double door leading into an even bigger hall.</p><p>While he usually got shivers when seeing those silver eyes in the dark, he felt extremely relieved to see them this time and he hurried through the open doors towards the big room where Hokuto was sitting on a huge wooden chair at the end of the hall without any windows.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Taiga asked and for a moment Hokuto did nothing but look back at him with a thoughtful expression. Taiga could see it, there was something dark in his eyes this time, but not as before when he was wounded.</p><p>"Shouldn't I ask you that?" Hokuto asked and Taiga bit his lip, moving his hand up to his neck.</p><p>"I feel fine, which is because of you, right? Am I-,"</p><p>"Even if I bite you there will be no change," Hokuto explained as he saw Taiga's troubled expression. "It's even the opposite. To not kill you by draining your blood, my bite can actually help you recover faster, that's why you also don't have to worry for your father. He is going to be fine."</p><p>That was a double relief for Taiga, but he still felt like there was something else going on he hadn't caught up to yet.</p><p>"Thank you for that even though it put you at risk," Taiga said. "Are you really okay?"</p><p>Hokuto leant to the front and put his elbows on his legs, resting his chin on the back of his hand with an intense stare towards Taiga.</p><p>"Do you remember what I told you the first time we met?"</p><p>There was so much they had talked about at their first few meetings that Taiga wasn't sure exactly which part he talked about so he shook his head.</p><p>"I know everything about a person through their blood. Even their oldest memories."</p><p>Taiga remembered that part and then it clicked and he gasped, stepping back without even wanting to. "My father's blood. He was a child when my grandfather hunted your kind down," Taiga caught up. "So, you saw what they did?"</p><p>Hokuto let out a low chuckle on that, an attitude he hadn’t shown yet.</p><p>When he got up and approached Taiga, the boy didn't dare to step back this time even when Hokuto came way too close and put one hand on Taiga's face, stroking a strand of hair behind his ear.</p><p>"Even better," Hokuto said as he leant to the front, whispering next to Taiga's ear. "Thanks to those memories I regained part of my own."</p><p>That was what they had aimed for, yet Taiga couldn't feel happy or relieved. Something about those memories was scaring him, Hokuto was scaring him. When Hokuto moved again he put one hand up around Taiga's neck as he lowered his lips towards the side of his neck and Taiga froze.</p><p>"Something is still missing, I can feel it. But for now the parts that are clear, won’t be to your liking. Your kind tried to kill us so often. You never even once tried to understand us."</p><p>"Didn't I try to understand you?" Taiga asked in a low voice, closing his eyes with a shuddering breath when Hokuto's hand closed a bit tighter around his neck.</p><p>"You did, but do you still want to know more? Are you not regretting helping me?"</p><p>"I don't regret it," Taiga let out immediately on which Hokuto moved a bit back to look at the boy's face with an amused expression.</p><p>"Then do you want to stay with me?" Hokuto asked and when Taiga wanted to reply he pulled him a bit closer once more, cutting his breath off for a moment with his grip. "Think carefully about your reply. I'll ask you once, but I won't let you go if you decide to stay."</p><p>Even though there was something way more dangerous than ever before about Hokuto, Taiga actually got angry at the boy's words and he reached out for Hokuto's collar and pulled him to the front.</p><p>It wasn't surprising that Hokuto actually let himself get pulled and loosened the grip on Taiga's neck when their lips met for a rough first kiss.</p><p>Hokuto immediately demanded the lead and closed his hand a bit more to make Taiga surrender to his movements, yet Taiga didn't mind. As long as his decision was understood like that he would surrender as often as needed.</p><p>"That was a quick decision," Hokuto said against the other one's lips, leaving Taiga slightly out of breath.</p><p>"Why would I leave after everything I've done to help you? What kind of life would await me if I go back now?"</p><p>Hokuto formed a lopsided smile on that before he took Taiga's bottom lip between his teeth and Taiga closed his eyes on that move before he dared his hands on the other one's chest. Hokuto finally released the other one's neck on that move and pulled him into a greedy kiss with his hand in the other one's hair.</p><p>"You're so human," Hokuto said as he moved his lips up to the other one's ears. "I can feel so much excitement, yet also fear."</p><p>"Do I have to fear you?" Taiga asked back and slowly Hokuto moved one hand around the boy's chin when he stepped back to look at him with his now dark shining eyes. The smile he formed made a shiver run through Taiga's body, but as Hokuto had said, it wasn't only fear. He had decided to stay and he wanted to make clear that he'd never betray the other one.</p><p>"Always," Hokuto finally replied and this time he showed his fangs. Provoking Taiga and feeling more of his fear was making Hokuto even more excited. To his surprise though, Taiga tilted his head, revealing his neck while he moved his arms loosely around the other one's upper body.</p><p>"Then show me how scary you can be," Taiga whispered next to the other one's ear before he bit down on the other one's neck, which made Hokuto chuckle before he dared his fangs on Taiga's skin.</p><p>"I'll show you real fear," Hokuto said in a low voice that sounded so unfamiliar to Taiga, but then all his thoughts were swallowed by the pain of Hokuto's fangs burying in his flesh once more.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Once more Taiga woke up alone in the same room as before, yet this time sunlight was piercing through the windows. He didn’t remember what exactly had happened the night before, but he didn’t feel in any way restless about his decision. Slowly he moved his hand up to his neck, but once more there was nothing on his skin. Yet there were also so many questions left he wanted to ask Hokuto. He needed to know what had happened between his people and his grandfather. He wanted to know about his memories even before that and also if…if Taiga asked for it if he could indeed turn him or if that part was also just a made up story from all those fictional books.</p><p>Knowing that Hokuto was definitely asleep somewhere in this huge castle, Taiga decided to get up and take a look around. The first place he went to was the cupboard at the corner of the room and while he hadn’t expected clothes to be in it, he was pleased to actually find clean clothes. His clothes were ripped, covered with dry blood and he wanted to get out of them. So even though the clothes in the cupboard seemed a bit old of course and didn’t have the nicest smell on them, he decided to change into them. He only took the pants and a loose shirt out of it as he didn’t want to wear the same ridiculous restricting clothes he had been forced to wear his entire life, so he ignored the expensive looking shirts and jackets inside before he finally made it out to the corridor once more.</p><p>He knew the way to the main hall already so he decided to move to the other side and randomly open doors, but he tried to be as silent as possible as he didn’t want to wake Hokuto in case he stumbled over his room. Weirdly though all rooms had windows so Taiga wondered where Hokuto was hiding during the day time.</p><p>After he had found a library, a few guest rooms and a room full of expensive looking dresses and suits he decided to make his way to the main hall once more, but even though he could see a bit more during the day there was no sunlight coming in, yet Hokuto wasn’t in this place either.</p><p>“Where are you hiding,” Taiga wondered and he was sure that Hokuto hadn’t just left him here after what he had said the day before. So he kept searching the castle. When he finally made it down to the ground floor he found a kitchen, but unfortunately no eatable food as the castle was most likely deserted for centuries already. Yet he realized that he didn’t feel that hungry. Maybe that was also something like a side effect from Hokuto’s bite, but sooner or later he would need to get food, which finally made him step outside.</p><p>Bright sunlight and a small breeze awaited him outside. When he looked straight ahead his eyes turned wide as he realized where this castle was located. Built on rocks, standing tall like a tower the castle was surrounded by water, the mainland visible yet far away.</p><p>“Well at least they won’t find us here easily,” Taiga said, trying to see the good in it, but now he really wondered how he was supposed to stay alive here, if that was what Hokuto aimed for in the first place?</p><p>Back inside the castle Taiga realized that there was another corridor and when he followed it for quite a while a circular staircase towards a lower level was visible at the end. Luckily there was a torch at the wall, which he was able to light, because the staircase seemed pitch black so he wouldn’t be able to make his way down without it.</p><p>When he stepped into the corridor at the end of the staircase his body started shivering because of the cold. There was no light reaching here and no warmth filled the place. When he moved the torch around he finally realized what kind of place this was and the next shiver wasn’t because of the cold.</p><p>Metal bars on the side of the corridor showed that these were the dungeons of the castle and Taiga didn’t even want to look more closely as he had already spotted what he didn’t want to see in the corner of his eyes. People have been left to die here before and their bones still remained. Ready to leave this place again Taiga wanted to turn around, but then he heard something from the back of the corridor. He could just leave, right? Why would he need to confirm anything? But weirdly he didn’t feel scared about going. Instead he felt kind of guilty so he put the torch around the corner on the staircase so that he could at least find the way back up, but then he took another deep breath and walked off into the pitch black corridor.</p><p>With his eyes unable to guide him, he felt like his hearing was catching even the smallest noise. After a few more meters when he couldn’t see even the hand in front of his face anymore he stopped as he suddenly wondered if he shouldn’t have come after all?</p><p>While he thought he would definitely realize every movement in the dark he was disabused the next second when he had not even any time to react when he was thrown to the back. The only reason he didn’t panic was the fact that he had clearly seen the silver shimmer in the dark.</p><p>“You really enjoy waking me up, don’t you?”</p><p>Taiga had landed on his back, but to his surprise his head hadn’t collided with the stone ground as Hokuto had his hand on the back of his head and was hovering over him, yet all Taiga could see were his eyes.</p><p>“I- I was wondering why you chose such a horrible place,” Taiga finally brought out, making Hokuto chuckle and release the boy as he stood up. Taiga hurried to stand up as well, but all he could follow was the silver shine or he wouldn’t know where to look.</p><p>“For me this is not a horrible place. You want me to join you in the sunlight instead?” Hokuto asked challenging.</p><p>“If there was no light would you mind joining me?” The words escaped Taiga before he had even been able to think about it. Hokuto stepped so close that Taiga would usually feel his breath, but then he remembered that he wasn’t breathing in the first place.</p><p>“Do you want me to join you?” Hokuto asked back and Taiga took a shuddering breath before he slowly nodded. He wasn’t feeling scared, but the way Hokuto didn’t know what personal space was, made it difficult for Taiga to concentrate. “Then I can join you tonight.”</p><p>A promise Taiga was looking forward to, yet he didn’t want to leave it at that and he carefully searched for Hokuto’s clothes and put his hand on the other one’s chest. To his surprise his body was never feeling cold, no matter in what environment he was in. Another part that all those books had gotten wrong.</p><p>“You should get back up, you will freeze to death down here,” Hokuto reminded him as Taiga’s body was indeed feeling way too cold. Not that it was much warmer in the castle. Winter had arrived early and they were out at sea so the wind made it even colder.</p><p>“Then warm me up later when you come, because you left me in a pretty cold place,” Taiga let out as he needed to scold Hokuto later for some more things as he had chosen a really difficult hiding place for Taiga, but that could wait. Now he was looking forward to actually finding a way for Hokuto to not have to stay at such a horrible place just to hide from the sun.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga’s room had turned into a battlefield of blankets and dust for the rest of the day and while he was sure that he would need to go down the cliffs to be able to take a bath, it was just way too cold to consider it, so eventually he had fallen asleep in the chaos he had created, unable to stay awake for longer.</p><p>A light touch on his hair woke him up later and he stretched his body a bit before he hid his face on the pillow before he realized that his face was itching to all the dust he hadn’t taken off the night before. Reluctantly he turned on his back and opened his eyes, not surprised to find Hokuto sitting next to him in the dark room.</p><p>“Is it still night time?” Taiga asked, but Hokuto shook his head.</p><p>“It’s early morning. But the fact that you can’t tell the time shows that you have done a good job with the windows,” Hokuto praised him.</p><p>The huge windows had all been covered by every kind of blanket and curtain Taiga had found in other rooms, so that even with the sun out, the room would remain dark, but still not too dark for him to see. It was the perfect mix for him to be able to see Hokuto and for the other one to not get disturbed by sunlight.</p><p>“Were you here the entire night?” Taiga asked, a bit guilty.</p><p>“Actually not, I got something for you, but you can still sleep a bit longer if you want?” Hokuto replied. Taiga moved a bit to the side on those words and cleaned his bed a bit from the dusk.</p><p>“Just if you stay with me for a while,” Taiga said with a teasing smile and to his surprise Hokuto crawled on the bed and lay down right in front of him, so close that Taiga wanted to give him more space, but he had reached the end of the bed.</p><p>“In that case you have to wake me up when you want to see what I got for you, because even in a dark room I will easily fall asleep at daytime,” Hokuto explained and the way he snuggled against Taiga’s body and got comfortable in the bed, Taiga dared for the first time to stretch his hand out and put a kiss on the other one’s hair.</p><p>“I will make sure that you get enough sleep as well, but I am really happy that you can now do it in a way more comfortable place,” Taiga said and pulled the other one closer. His body warmth still felt unnatural to him as he had always imagined his body to be cold, yet he also easily fell asleep once more in the other one’s arms.</p><p>***</p><p>Maybe Taiga should have woken up Hokuto, but seeing him sleep this peacefully made him slowly get up from the bed without disturbing the other one. He wasn’t sure if he could even move around without Hokuto realizing, but if he faked his sleep and didn’t scold Taiga for not waking him up he would give Hokuto more hours of sleep as it was maybe barely noon when he stepped out to one of the balconies, overlooking the ocean.</p><p>Hokuto would be able to move through parts of the castle at daytime thanks to the heavy walls, but there were also parts with huge windows like the corridor he was in now next to the balcony. When he kept walking he realized how he suddenly felt extremely lightheaded and that was when he remembered that after all the work he had done the day before with the curtains and blankets he still hadn’t gotten any food or water so far.</p><p>Slowly he put his hand up to his neck with an absentminded look. There were still so many unanswered questions and problems lying ahead, but somehow Taiga didn’t want to have any complicated discussions now, even though he knew they were more than necessary.</p><p>When Taiga moved past the kitchen on the lower floor he tilted his head after he was already a few steps away and then made a few steps back.</p><p>“What…,” he let out in disbelief when he found wooden boxes full of food and even barrels with water. “When did he get all these?”</p><p>“Last night,” Hokuto said suddenly next to him, making Taiga jump out of surprise.</p><p>“Did I wake you up again?” Taiga asked guilty.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it too much, it’s not like I need to sleep as long as humans, usually I only need to sleep more when I get exhausted.”</p><p>Which had been the case after Taiga had made him walk under the sun, but now he indeed didn’t look exhausted.</p><p>“But- don’t you also need to, ehm…” Taiga didn’t want to voice it out, just the thought of it made his heart race. Something Hokuto immediately realized as he stepped closer to the other one and tilted his head to put his lips closer to the other one’s neck, resulting in Taiga tensing.</p><p>“If I need your blood?” Hokuto asked and when Taiga could feel Hokuto’s fangs on his skin he actually found the courage to pull back. When Hokuto gave him a teasing smile the next moment his fangs were gone once more. “I don’t necessarily need to, no.”</p><p>“So you only need blood when you’re exhausted?” Taiga asked straight forward as he finally wanted some answers.</p><p>“I slept for quite a while and didn’t immediately attack you even though you hurt yourself in my place, doesn’t that answer your question?”</p><p>Thinking about that time and also their encounters after that, Hokuto had never attacked him even if he had been bleeding.</p><p>“For us time works differently. The night your father accidently shot you was the first time I actually felt like losing control, but that wasn’t because of your wound, but because it was the first time I felt like I needed to fight so I was on such high alert that my body wanted your blood.”</p><p>“That’s why you didn’t come close to me at that time,” Taiga concluded and somehow it made him feel relieved and he walked over to the food and grabbed some bread from one of the boxes. “I guess you didn’t pay for those?”</p><p>The teasing smile Taiga showed while waving the bread towards Hokuto’s direction made the other one roll his eyes. “Let’s say there are some expensive things in this castle I left in exchange. It’s not like I can wake them up at night and ask them to pack food for me.”</p><p>“I can go myself the next time,” Taiga said, but just the thought of having to go back to the mainland by himself, not knowing if his father was actually still trying to find him scared him.</p><p>“Or you come with me on my next night trip, how does that sound?” Hokuto asked and took an apple, throwing it towards Taiga who caught it at the last second. “And if you feel tired of making trips to the mainland I can still help out with that human habit.”</p><p>Once more Taiga’s hand moved a bit up to his neck, but he didn’t feel too concerned about it now that he knew that Hokuto wouldn’t actually suddenly turn against him without any reason, but that also made him realize that there was more to talk about.</p><p>“About your-”</p><p>“Eat for now, okay? I will wait in the library, but I can feel in your heartbeat that you need this more than you think right now,” Hokuto said before he left Taiga alone for now and vanished into the dark corridor.</p><p>After a moment alone Taiga dared to light a lamp and sat down to finally eat and drink. He used the time to also get his thoughts straight. He didn’t want to ask impolite questions, but he also couldn’t just stay here with Hokuto without being sure what exactly they would face together from now on. After all, he had left his entire life behind to run away with him, yet he needed to know how the situation was for Hokuto.</p><p>***</p><p>The library was bigger than the one of Hokuto's former place yet not as big as their city's library. But the wooden shelves had beautiful detailed engravings and the entire room smelled of old books. But the first thing Taiga realized was that there were two huge windows at one wall and while it was already evening there was still the last light of the day piercing through it.</p><p>After looking around for a bit he saw that there was another corridor in the back and the light slowly faded towards the smaller second room at the end of it as it had no window. Taiga's eyes needed a moment to get used to the dark, but then he spotted Hokuto on an armchair where he had fallen asleep once more.</p><p>Slowly he walked up to him and took the book that was dangerously hanging half of his thigh, from his hand and put it on the table next to him.</p><p>"My presence here makes it more difficult for you to rest," Taiga said as he sat down on the small footstool in front of the armchair.</p><p>"If I'd care I would have sent you away already," Hokuto let out without even opening his eyes. "It's just a comfortable place to rest. You should try it."</p><p>First Taiga didn't move, but then Hokuto cracked one eye open and moved a bit to the side. Taiga chuckled on that move as the armchair wasn't exactly made for two people yet he took the invitation and tried to find a comfortable position next to Hokuto. The other one immediately put his arms around him and pulled him closer so that he would stop moving around.</p><p>"Nice isn't it?" Hokuto asked as he rested his chin on the other one's hair and used Taiga almost as a pillow the way he put his arms and legs around him.</p><p>"Since when are you all this cuddly?" Taiga asked, but he didn't complain, because he liked it.</p><p>"Am I supposed to be different?" Hokuto asked and suddenly moved his head up a bit towards Taiga's neck. "You know I can also behave completely differently if you want to."</p><p>The way Hokuto touched his neck with his lips made Taiga shiver, but this time he didn't mind as he could feel Hokuto's playful behavior behind that statement.</p><p>"I prefer you cuddly," Taiga said and placed a kiss on Hokuto's head before he started playing with his strands of hair.</p><p>Even though they remained silent for a while it didn't feel weird to Taiga and when he realized that Hokuto had fallen back asleep he reached over him to get the book he had picked up before.</p><p>The hardcover showed the title the monk written by Matthew Lewis and Taiga randomly started reading. Lost in the book Taiga almost missed the squeeze he got around his hips.</p><p>"Your heart rate has gone up and your face is all flushed, why is that?" Hokuto asked so innocently when he woke up, as if he hadn't felt the same while reading this extremely catchy yet disturbing book about a man whose fantasies and actions were everything but harmless.</p><p>Taiga cleared his throat before he closed the book and gave Hokuto some space to sit up, but he didn't bother getting out of the chair.</p><p>"Do you not feel the emotions of the characters when you read a book?" Taiga asked, but Hokuto didn't seem to have an easy reply to that. Maybe he couldn't understand their human emotions that easily even if he read about them.</p><p>"I unfortunately couldn't bring the book from your library," Taiga let out a bit gloomy. "I fear my father already burned it. Maybe he also burned your place down."</p><p>"I don't care," Hokuto let out way too carefree, but Taiga couldn't find any lie in his expression. "That place wasn't mine from the start."</p><p>On that topic Taiga felt nervous, but he knew he couldn't just stay here with Hokuto and ignore everything that was happening around them.</p><p>"How much do you remember?"</p><p>"My life goes back way too far to remember everything in the first place. There are parts that seem missing, like a certain presence in my life was erased from my memory, but I remember what humans have done to my kind."</p><p>Hokuto's voice turned darker and with it his mood, but he shouldn't run away from it either so Taiga shifted a bit to sit more upright. "My grandfather, he was part of it, right?"</p><p>"Yes, he hunting my kind with people of your city and then started roaming the land to disturb our peaceful existence and cause uproar, making even more humans join his ridiculous and pointless chase."</p><p>"But, aren't you stronger than humans?" Taiga asked carefully.</p><p>"You've seen it yourself. If they attack at day time we have a disadvantage. Fire is also a deadly weapon against us and after a decade of hide and seek with the humans a lot of us had enough. If they wanted to see us as monsters then we would show them how real monsters looked like."</p><p>When Hokuto didn't continue, Taiga gave his words a long thought until it clicked. "That house you were in and also this place. Both belonged to humans before. It wasn't the humans who had destroyed it, but you."</p><p>"Indeed. The reason I somehow remembered this place faintly is because we once gathered here. I wasn’t alone at that house either, I know that, but something is still missing in my memory. But your city was full of those people trying to hunt my kind down. They didn't even once try to talk to us or understand us, so we didn't either."</p><p>There was so much Taiga wanted to ask, but he could feel how Hokuto had tensed. His hate towards humans was obviously really strong, which made him wonder how he could accept Taiga next to him.</p><p>"But why have you been asleep for so long?" Taiga asked.</p><p>"You're trying to talk around the topic you want to know about," Hokuto said as he finally got up from the chair, but Taiga didn't dare to follow him. Hokuto made a few steps towards another table and leant with his legs against it. "Yes it was me who killed your grandfather."</p><p>Of course Taiga had that question in the back of his mind and he wasn't shocked about it either, but he still looked away on Hokuto's piercing look.</p><p>"I remember your grandfather clearly. Usually my kind doesn’t move in packs, but I know that at that time I barely managed to fight. Something felt weird at that time.  We killed a lot of them in the first night, but while we thought we could hide at that house over the day they found us and all I remember are a lot of torches, shouting and fire. I got badly hurt in that fight too, but I didn't let any of them escape on that day. Why I slept for that long and why my memory is so blurry now I don’t know myself."</p><p>Taiga only nodded at first, but Hokuto didn't seem angry or hurt and the lack of emotion made it difficult for Taiga to react.</p><p>"Was he your friend?"</p><p>"I don’t know,” Hokuto replied honestly. “A lot of us fought in groups at that time to kill those humans who tried to murder our kind. But I can’t remember who I was with and if he survived that day or not.”</p><p>Hokuto’s look showed a bit of sadness on the way he couldn’t remember what seemed to be an important part of his memory, but Taiga hoped that with more time he could regain those missing parts as well.</p><p>"Now that you remember, what do you- I mean-... I'm not-"</p><p>"Why I let a human live and even invite him to stay with me? Furthermore a member of one of the families who started all of this?"</p><p>The direct way of voicing it out made Taiga look to the ground in discomfort as he started clawing his own skin around the wrists.</p><p>"Do you doubt my intentions?" Hokuto asked directly, making Taiga immediately look back up at him.</p><p>"I- I don't know. Because we never actually talked about your intentions. You also never really clarified what- I mean who you really are."</p><p>"Aren't I a vampire?" Hokuto asked back with a slightly teasing expression. "At least that's what your books call me, right? In all those books we have read together I've never found any creature or monster as you like calling us that had more similarities than the one you call vampire."</p><p>"Yet a lot about them is false," Taiga voiced out a bit sheepish after he remembered how they had actually tried out all those stupid methods from the books to identify vampires.</p><p>"And some are true," Hokuto reminded him while licking his lips.</p><p>Taiga nodded slowly, but when Hokuto walked away from the table towards the corridor he finally got up as well.</p><p>"Do you mind if I find out for myself what else is false and what might be something no one has discovered until now?" Taiga asked in a rush, making Hokuto halt and turn back to him with an amused expression.</p><p>"If that is going to be your intention of staying then I won't stop you," Hokuto replied seriously.</p><p>"Then what was your attention when you rescued me and brought me here?"</p><p>Hokuto walked back to Taiga and put his hand up to the other one's cheek with a playful expression before he leant towards his ear. "You might have to find that out by yourself."</p><p>Of course Hokuto used the moment to brush his lips over Taiga's neck once more, but Taiga was done feeling restless or scared. So when Hokuto wanted to pull back he grabbed Hokuto by the collar and pulled him into a greedy kiss.</p><p>The other one reacted with a faint smile, but let Taiga lead the kiss and enjoyed it how Taiga's hands were slightly shaking when he moved them up to the other one's hair, while Hokuto pushed him a bit too roughly into the next shelf, making Taiga gasp. The perfect opportunity for Hokuto to deepen the kiss and get into control.</p><p>Taiga's legs started feeling weak after a moment and his hands started to move down to Hokuto's chest, then to the seam of his shirt.</p><p>He wanted to say something, but Hokuto wouldn't let him and then he decided that words were overrated and that they could tell each other their needs way easier in this way.</p><p>This time Taiga was the one to push and he made Hokuto stumble back to the armchair. It was definitely not the best place, but better than nothing.</p><p>Hokuto had his hands under the other one’s shirt while Taiga was busy with Hokuto's pants. There was not a single sign of hesitation in either of their movements and while that was definitely normal for Hokuto, Taiga was surprising himself with his determined movements.</p><p>After a small struggle of getting clothes out of the way Taiga didn't hesitate to close his hand around Hokuto’s erection. Once more Taiga wanted to say something, maybe even tease the other one, but something about Hokuto's intense look stopped him and he bit his lip while he shifted a bit making it possible for Hokuto to pull his pants down completely and pull him on his legs before he pulled him down for another greedy and passionate kiss.</p><p>Hokuto's hands moved from Taiga's back to his hips and while Taiga was sure that their pace wasn't a good idea he was too aroused himself to delay anything and as he didn’t know for how long he could keep this confidence he wanted to hurry. Just a few moments of hesitation could make him feel embarrassed and still pull away.</p><p>He let out a muffled whine and hid his face on Hokuto's neck when he lowered himself on Hokuto, but the other one was a master in distracting him. His lips were on his neck, then his hands were distracting him with his own erection, but it was still difficult for Taiga to relax.</p><p>When Hokuto suddenly bit him, but didn't use his fangs, the wave of pleasure filling Taiga's body almost made him come way too soon and he was finally able to thrust his hips against Hokuto who didn't need to be active that much himself, but he still kept his hands and lips all over the other one's body, which made it so hard for Taiga to delay the reaction of his excitement as he wanted to enjoy this as much as possible.</p><p>While he tried to keep himself from talking, he couldn't hide his moans, but the way Hokuto buried his fingers in his hips and thrusted up himself this time it was obvious that there was no need to hide any sounds.</p><p>While Taiga already felt out of breath, Hokuto seemed still as relaxed as always and his body heat made Taiga feel even more aroused and he gave Hokuto one last passionate kiss to signal him that he was way too close.</p><p>Instead of letting Taiga come this easily, Hokuto moved his lips away from the kiss and put his lips back on his neck. His hand reached out for Taiga's erection once more while he thrusted in deeper than Taiga was feeling comfortable with and then Taiga could feel the other one’s fangs on his skin once more.</p><p>The moment he could feel the warm pain of them burying in his neck everything got too much for him and he came with a way too high pitched moan, which made him blush and finally let that hold back embarrassment take over as he put his arms around Hokuto's shoulders and hid his face at the other one's neck.</p><p>He could feel Hokuto's body shaking a bit as well as he had pulled back his fangs, but it was difficult to say if he had come as well or if he even enjoyed it as much as Taiga, but for now he didn't want to ask and the way Hokuto closed his arms protectively around Taiga made him smile and close his eyes. Maybe he didn't need more explanations, maybe not knowing everything and just finding out about the other one by exploring their limits was something Taiga was totally okay with for the rest of his life. As long as his human life lasted at least.</p>

  <p>Days turned into weeks and finally Taiga had enough of sitting around in this castle all the time. Not that he didn't enjoy Hokuto's company, but it was difficult for both of them to find time together as Taiga of course tried to stay awake at night, but at some point his body would just demand a normal day night rhythm again and for Hokuto it was even more complicated as he wouldn't be at full strength even if the windows were hung up.</p><p>So for once they actually left the castle together with the small boat and made it to the mainland at nightfall.</p><p>Instead of the harbor, Hokuto secured the boat at a rock around a forest area and he helped Taiga alongside the steep cliff walls until they reached the harbor.</p><p>"We get supplies and leave," Hokuto said as he started walking straight to the main road. This time they were early enough to actually buy things at open stores and not have Hokuto sneak around and leave random payment at people's closed stores, but of course Hokuto had to keep his hood low over his eyes and he let Taiga do most of the talking.</p><p>"Why are you in such a hurry? I know the light of the stores annoys you, but how about we walk around the harbor area a bit later where there is not much light?"</p><p>Hokuto just nodded for now and they hurried to get the supplies for Taiga before the shops closed. Soon the harbor area fell silent and Taiga walked through the streets with a calm smile.</p><p>"You miss them," Hokuto said, startling Taiga as he didn't understand at first. "Humans, you miss being around them. I bet you miss your family too."</p><p>For a moment Taiga didn't reply, but he also didn't feel bad about the question. "Being around humans, yes I think I miss it a bit. But all these noble families not that much, because I hated being around them," Taiga replied honestly. "My family…"</p><p>For a moment Taiga was lost in his thoughts as he slowed down, but then he shook his head. "I'm grateful that you let my father go on that day and I really wish them well, but I never felt like I belonged in that kind of family in the first place so no I don't really miss them."</p><p>Hokuto looked at him quite doubting, but Taiga wasn't telling a lie to make the other one feel calmer.</p><p>"Fine, then I guess we should have some more trips to town from now on."</p><p>First Taiga just stopped, but then he saw Hokuto's torn expression and Taiga walked closer to him, giving him a sudden hug.</p><p>"What was that for?" Hokuto asked a bit startled, making Taiga smile.</p><p>"A thank you for going out of your way for me. I know that being around all these humans isn't easy for you, yet you offered to make more trips just so I can be around them from time to time."</p><p>Hokuto didn't reply as they kept walking around the wooden docks at the harbor for a while.</p><p>"Let's sit down?" Taiga asked as they had a lot of supplies to carry around and they put them all down and Taiga lay on his back and looked up at the clear night sky.</p><p>"Is there anything you're afraid of?"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Hokuto asked on the sudden question as he had sat down and looked ahead at the ocean.</p><p>"I mean you're different to humans, yet also kind of similar. I just wonder if there is anything you ever felt afraid of."</p><p>Hokuto thought about it for a moment, but it was obvious that he couldn't think about anything.</p><p>"Are you afraid of anything?" Hokuto asked back.</p><p>"I'm afraid of bugs," Taiga said before he had to laugh at his own statement. "Well I think there are different kinds of fears, so this one is an embarrassing one."</p><p>"Then what other kinds of fears are there?" Hokuto asked curiously as he turned to face the other one and finally Taiga sat back up and looked ahead.</p><p>"The kind that will give you nightmares and will haunt you if it gets the best of you. Something that might not be reality yet, but could easily become one."</p><p>Hokuto waited patiently for Taiga to continue as he obviously wanted to know more.</p><p>"I feared to be trapped in my life as a noble man. I didn't enjoy any of those political meetings or stupid balls. Yet I knew that my family wanted me to marry and become exactly like one of those people and it scared me. I felt like I wouldn't be able to deal with that life, a life that wasn't meant for me, but was forced onto me. The fear of not being able to live like that."</p><p>"But what other choice would you have had?" Hokuto asked.</p><p>"Only one," Taiga said, now his eyes wandering down to the water with a dark expression. "Put an end to that life."</p><p>"But don't humans fear death?" Hokuto asked, not even judging Taiga for his thoughts.</p><p>"Most do, I think. I also do fear death, but I feared a life I didn't want way more so in the end one fear will overshadow the other one."</p><p>"What about your life now?"</p><p>Taiga looked up at the other one on that question, but then he formed a smile and reached out for Hokuto's face with a soft touch on his cheek. "This is no life I fear, the only thing I fear now is that it could get taken away from me again."</p><p>"I won't let anyone take you away," Hokuto growled as if it had been a threat.</p><p>"And no one will," Taiga soothed him before he leaned in for a passionate kiss.</p><p>Hokuto was about to put his hand into the other one's hair when he suddenly backed off and looked over Taiga's shoulder with a dangerous glare.</p><p>Taiga immediately followed his look, but he couldn't see anyone.</p><p>"What is it?" Taiga asked alarmed, but Hokuto kept staring ahead, making Taiga shiver as he didn't understand what was going on.</p><p>"Let's leave," Hokuto finally let out and dragged Taiga up.</p><p>"Hokuto, what the hell is going on?" Taiga asked again, but Hokuto only threw some of the supplies in his arms and dragged him along the docks.</p><p>Then finally Taiga could see them. Guard, carrying lamps on their night watch. Still too far away to be of any danger to them, but Hokuto had obviously felt them approaching already.</p><p>"What do they want?" Taiga whispered towards Hokuto as they made it towards the rocks at the harbor.</p><p>"They are just patrolling the area. I've seen them before, but I think they got suspicious lately, I see them way more often now," Hokuto finally explained.</p><p>"But when we were around town no one looked at us in a suspicious way," Taiga realized.</p><p>"That's because I usually go at midnight so they don't really think I'd be here earlier, but we might have to look for another harbor for supplies soon," Hokuto explained and it wasn't like Taiga minded as he didn't want to cause trouble to Hokuto in any way.</p><p>***</p><p>Weeks had turned into months, but Taiga didn't keep track of time that much. He had a lot of free time on his hands, but he had found a liking in cooking as the castle had a huge kitchen and they regularly went to get supplies and fire food as the castle was also too cold for Taiga at night. The books in the library could also keep him busy for a lifetime and he spent a lot of time reading together with Hokuto, but usually all the books landed on the ground eventually. Especially this time when Hokuto handed him a book to read out loud, it had been impossible for Taiga to keep a straight face at some point as Dangerous Liaisons was a book about everything but normal and harmless topics. It had been the only time Taiga had lost his patience first and of course Hokuto had enjoyed it to the fullest.</p><p>"You totally knew what this book was about," Taiga teased as he placed another kiss on Hokuto's chest and the other one licked his lips as he had barely calmed down again. As so often they hadn't even moved out of the library and had ended up on the carpet eventually, but now they were cuddling on the armchair.</p><p>"Maybe?" Hokuto teased and closed his eyes as he put his head to the back.</p><p>"You should rest. The sun has definitely risen by now," Taiga said.</p><p>"You should rest some as well then. I kept you awake all night."</p><p>"I will sleep in a bit, but I need to get something in my stomach first. I'll come back in a bit, okay?" Taiga asked and got up in a sitting position, but Hokuto pulled him back a bit with his elbow around the other one's neck and engaged their lips in a slightly copper tasting kiss as Hokuto had bitten him as so often, but Taiga didn't even mind anymore. It had something arousing after all and he wasn't in any kind harmed by it, maybe just slightly dizzy and definitely hungry after it, but his food needed to be taken from the kitchen and not from the other one’s neck unfortunately.</p><p>"You should rest in your own bed for a while," Hokuto said, knowing that the armchair wasn't the most comfortable sleeping choice if both of them used it.</p><p>"Oh, are you trying to get rid of me?" Taiga teased, but finally got up to get dressed.</p><p>"The opposite. I want you to rest well so I can occupy you even more later," Hokuto teased back.</p><p>"Then I guess you need to choose a new book for tonight or I won't get into the right mood," Taiga said and gave the other one a wink before he left Hokuto for his daytime rest.</p><p>While making some food in the kitchen Taiga hummed a random melody when he needed to smile at himself. After months with the same routine he thought he would get tired of it at some point, but he had never felt more at home.</p><p>"I wish we could live like this forever," Taiga whispered to himself, but then his mood dropped as he realized that for him there would be no forever while Hokuto would need to live without him at some point.</p><p>"I guess I just added another fear to my list," Taiga laughed at himself as he had seen death lightly until now while he didn't want to waste any of his precious years with Hokuto now.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts Taiga felt like he had heard something, but usually all he heard was the sound of the waves on the rocks or the wind going through the halls of the castle. But it had been a really calm morning when he had walked through the castle so now Taiga got curious and walked towards the balcony. As expected there were no high waves, the sun was out and the wind was only a light breeze, but when he looked down to the rocks on west side of the castle his eyes grew wide as he realized that the boat he was seeing wasn't their own.</p><p>In panic Taiga ran back into the castle, but on his way down to the library he could hear voices from the lowest floor and instead of making his way to the back of the castle he decided to dash down to the next floor as he didn't want Hokuto to wake up. Who knew how Hokuto would react to a sudden intrusion.</p><p>On the bottom of the next staircase Taiga hid at the wall and carefully looked towards the entrance hall of the castle.</p><p>"Woah this is so awesome!" A boy yelled super excited and kept running forth and back, touching everything in his reach.</p><p>"Shin, stop it. We are not even supposed to be here. It's forbidden," another boy warned him.</p><p>"Don't be poor sports Kochi. You could have stayed behind," a third boy interfered.</p><p>"Juri, you know that if I hadn't come with you trouble makers then you would get yourself into even more problems than we already got in by coming here!"</p><p>All of the boys seemed from one of the harbor towns, simple clothes in beige with no coats or high boots that showed that they were most likely fishers or harbor workers.</p><p>"You already lost the biggest trouble maker so I think you're not that useful after all," Shin joked on which Kochi sighed and rubbed his temples.</p><p>Taiga was relieved to see that they didn't look dangerous, but that didn't mean they wouldn't change their behavior if they encountered Hokuto.</p><p>Taiga had remained almost completely hidden at the stair case yet the last place he thought someone else would show up was directly behind him and that someone had clapped him on the back without any warning, making Taiga squeal and almost fall down the steps of the staircase before he stopped in the middle of the hallway. The three boys all gave him a confused look until the fourth one started laughing way too loud at the staircase. Taiga immediately wanted to tell him to shut up, but luckily Kochi already took care of that.</p><p>"Jesse, for god's sake. We told you to stay quiet."</p><p>"For what reason? To not wake the ghosts?" Jesse laughed, but tried to not be too loud this time.</p><p>"You woke up one," Shin said as he pointed at Taiga. "Look at his clothes. They totally look like from the last century."</p><p>He wasn't wrong as Taiga used the clothes he had found in the castle and had only gotten a new pair of normal clothes for when they were going to town.</p><p>For a moment a weird silence fell between all of them until Juri took a small stone from the ground and threw it against Taiga's chest. In confusion Taiga looked back at them all, but then Juri shrugged his shoulders. "No ghost."</p><p>Kochi approached him and gave him a harsh slap on the back of his head. "Idiot of course he is no ghost."</p><p>"So then who are you and why do you look so fancy?"</p><p>Jesse asked as he walked up to Taiga and pulled on the wide double layered collar of his white shirt.</p><p>"I'm Taiga."</p><p>What else was he supposed to reply? But they all seemed to be satisfied for now and especially relieved that he wasn't indeed a ghost, not that they would run into something even more frightening if Taiga didn't stop them.</p><p>"What are you all doing here?" Taiga asked, trying to get the topic away from himself.</p><p>"Ghost hunting," Shin let out and crossed his arms to his chest.</p><p>"Well not quite," Kochi interfered. "We just wanted to see the ruins of the castle of the last century. We know it's officially not allowed for boats to come close as the docks have been ripped off."</p><p>"Where is your boat?" Jesse asked randomly.</p><p>"On the backside," Taiga replied as it wasn't a lie.</p><p>"So you also came to explore?" Juri asked.</p><p>Taiga didn't know what to reply, but then Jesse hit him on the shoulder. "Then let's all explore the castle together! The weather hasn't been this great in months, but who knows how long it will last."</p><p>Right, usually the bad weather and high waves would keep everyone away, yet of course some curious fisher boys had to make it their task to go on an adventure to the castle.</p><p>"Let's not waste time," Shin said and wanted to go after Jesse who was already back on the stairs.</p><p>"Wait!" Taiga stopped them, making Kochi raise an eyebrow at him.</p><p>"Did you by any chance already explore alone and found something interesting you don't want to share?" Jesse asked and while Taiga wasn't even sure with what kind of lie he should come up Shin suddenly dashed passed him followed by a cheering and yelling Jesse.</p><p>"Well now he's definitely awake," Taiga mumbled to himself.</p><p>"What was that?" Juri asked, but Taiga immediately shook his head.</p><p>"Nothing. Let's go then I think?" Taiga said, trying to play his worries down.</p><p>Kochi and Juri gave him a questioning look, but didn't say anything else.</p><p>"Woah, it's a throne!" Jesse yelled as they had run up towards the main hall.</p><p>"Not as big as I thought," Juri said and looked at the high walls and decorations instead.</p><p>Kochi suddenly slapped Taiga on the shoulder, making the boy jolt more than he normally would, but he was distracted and kept looking down the corridors and tried to hear any noise, not that Hokuto would be easily spotted if he didn't want to be seen.</p><p>"Are you afraid of ghosts or why do you keep looking around so panicked?"</p><p>"You were here all by yourself before, you shouldn't be of the scared type," Jesse joked.</p><p>"Guys, there is food!" Shin yelled from the corridor. Taiga hadn't even realized that he had run out of the hall once more.</p><p>"Food?" Kochi asked with a raised eyebrow as they all made it to the kitchen.</p><p>"This is fresh," Juri said as he touched some of it.</p><p>"That reminds me that in one of the villages they said that sometimes food was vanishing from their stores at night, but instead there were jewelry and other expensive belongings left in its spot," Kochi remembered and then he looked back at Taiga who had fallen silent on the discovery of the kitchen.</p><p>"Taiga, could it be that you didn't come here today, but live here?"</p><p>On Kochi's question Jesse and Shin started yelling around how awesome of a living place this was.</p><p>"Are you all by yourself here?" Juri asked as they took Taiga's embarrassed look as a yes.</p><p>"The reason I live here is complicated," Taiga finally let out and once more his look fell into the corridor where the light didn't reach anymore at the staircase to the third floor.</p><p>"Are you really alone?" Kochi asked this time more serious and also a bit alarmed.</p><p>What was he supposed to reply to that? But unfortunately his panic to reply got interpreted in a wrong way by the others and Juri suddenly drew a fisher knife as he went out to the corridor.</p><p>"No! I'm not being kept here," Taiga immediately yelled after the other one, but Kochi gave him a skeptical look.</p><p>"If you're afraid that we can't stand a chance we can also run?" Kochi suggested. While Shin and Jesse have already gone into attack mode and followed Juri towards the stairs of the third floor.</p><p>With a sigh Taiga put his hands into his hair, not knowing what to say. But then he dashed after the three, knowing that he was the only one who could prevent the worst outcome.</p><p>"Damn, it's dark up here. Why are all the windows hung up?" Shin asked as they kept walking along the third floor corridor.</p><p>"Wait," Taiga yelled after them, Kochi following him, but then stopped at an open door.</p><p>"Why is even the bedroom hung up? Is that person forcing you to live in the dark?"</p><p>"No one is forcing me to do anything. You misunderstood the situation," Taiga finally explained. " But there is someone with you, right?" Juri asked, not putting the knife back yet.</p><p>"Why are you not explaining the situation if you feel like we're misunderstanding?" Kochi asked a bit impatient.</p><p>"As I said, it's all a bit complicated. I don't know how to explain it."</p><p>A gasp from Jesse made them turn towards the two boys who had, of course, gone further into the corridor.</p><p>"What is it?" Juri asked and raised the knife.</p><p>Both boys didn't reply at first as they kept looking towards the dark end of the corridor, but the next second the others also saw it. Silver eyes.</p><p>Shin started screaming first and dashed back, followed by Jesse. Both boys ran behind Juri who was holding the knife out, but Taiga hurried to step in front of him.</p><p>"Please let me explain," Taiga said, holding his hands out towards them so they wouldn't try to attack Hokuto.</p><p>"What is that?" Shin asked in a shaking voice.</p><p>"He's not a thing," Taiga sharply replied, realizing how angry he got at people for judging without even knowing anything, yet Taiga had been the same at the beginning.</p><p>"Taiga, come back here," Kochi said, trying to keep his distance, but also slightly panicking about what he was seeing. "We can just leave this place. Come with us."</p><p>"You think you can outrun me?"</p><p>Now Hokuto had brought a full new level of panic upon them, especially because he had hissed the words more than usual.</p><p>While even Juri started pushing the others to the back now, Taiga rolled his eyes and turned towards Hokuto, approaching the other one with big steps.</p><p>"Is he crazy?" Jesse asked in panic, but didn't dare to follow of course.</p><p>What no one had seen coming was Taiga hitting the other one lightly on the head with a scolding look.</p><p>"I'm trying to make them like you, not fear you. Aren't you having too much fun here?"</p><p>Everyone was left dumbfounded as Hokuto started laughing, which already made Taiga finally relax a bit. He was risking a lot too with his behavior, because if Hokuto really felt threatened by the boys then he could easily get angry at Taiga as well for taking their side. But luckily Hokuto seemed to have already realized that they were in the castle and had decided to turn it into a game.</p><p>Taiga dragged the other one a bit more into the corridor so that the others could finally see him clearer. But of course the silver eyes made them all back away.</p><p>"This is Hokuto. I'm living here with him. As you can see it's not easy to have people around us without them panicking or attacking, that's why we live here."</p><p>"So, you're not something like a ghost or whatsoever hunting this place?" Jesse asked, Hokuto showing a teasing smile on that question.</p><p>"What if I was?"</p><p>"Then I'd say that's really cool," Shin replied instead. Now their teasing attitude finally came back, but Taiga could see how Juri and Kochi were still skeptical, yet Juri had finally put the knife away.</p><p>"But you're not human, are you?" Kochi finally let out and on that question Taiga and Hokuto exchanged a knowing look. What would happen if they told them the truth? And could they even keep living here now that they had found out about them living here? At least Shin and Jesse didn't seem like people who could keep secrets. But Taiga wouldn't even consider hurting them to keep their secret that was out of question. They couldn't keep them here, but they also had to fear that they felt threatened by Hokuto and then the same disaster as at Taiga's city would take place.</p><p>"I'm what you humans would call a vampire."</p><p>"Hokuto," Taiga scolded the other one immediately, but Hokuto looked calm about his decision to tell them.</p><p>"A vampire? What's that?" Shin asked, not having heard of that word, not that Taiga had known until he had read about them and a lot of what humans described about them was also false.</p><p>"Creatures that can't walk in the light and drink human blood," Kochi let out in a low voice, now looking a lot paler than before.</p><p>"Almost right," Hokuto said and then his look fell on Juri. "If you don't attack, I won't either."</p><p>That warning made Juri pull back from trying to get his knife back out after Kochi’s words had made him panic.</p><p>"This is a disaster," Taiga whined on which Hokuto put his arm around his shoulder and gave him a kiss on the hair.</p><p>"I'd say it's a good opportunity for you to make some friends."</p><p>"If you stopped pretending to want to eat them alive then they would make awesome friends I'm sure of that," Taiga scolded the other one, hitting him on the chest.</p><p>"Hey I just told them who I am and that I won't do anything to them," Hokuto replied playfully.</p><p>"We're still here by the way," Jesse interfered as the other two had entered their own private kind of conversation.</p><p>"Sorry, it's just all a bit much right now," Taiga explained. "If you want us to explain more then we will totally do so, but please believe me when I say that we both want to be here, okay?"</p><p>Finally Kochi nodded, even though he still seemed more than scared about Hokuto as he was the only one who had at least heard about vampires before.</p><p>"Can we go back to the hall, I feel creeped out up here in the dark," Shin said.</p><p>"I can go down with you and explain everything," Taiga offered.</p><p>"So it's true? He can't go into the light?" Juri asked.</p><p>"I can go if I have to, but as you don't feel comfortable in the dark, I also don't favor the light."</p><p>This time Taiga was thankful that Hokuto wasn't that honest, because if the boys knew that the light would weaken him then they might rip the covers off the windows if they felt threatened.</p><p>"So are you up for a talk?" Taiga asked and the four boys exchanged a few worried looks until Kochi nodded.</p><p>"Fine, let's hear your story."</p>

  <p>“Any questions?” Taiga closed his talk he had with the boys in a big common room he had never really used as it had too many windows for Hokuto to use it at day time and he had never really planned on having people come to this place, so the room was also quite dusty.</p><p>“Just one,” Shintaro said as he leant with his elbows on the table after he had listened to Taiga with such a fascination like the other one was telling a fairytale. “How the hell are you still alive?”</p><p>Taiga had to smile a bit on the boy’s question, not that he had gone too much into details. He had explained the past of Hokuto’s people and the massacre the humans of his city had brought upon them, but details about his grandfather being involved or his father trying to hunt them down were something he wasn’t sure if he could share with them that easily yet. So they knew that he had run from his family as they wouldn’t understand why he wanted to protect Hokuto and of course he had given the boys some warnings about Hokuto usually not being aggressive, but that they should be careful how they behaved around him. Once more though he had kept his weaknesses a secret for now.</p><p>“That’s a pretty rough start for you two,” Juri let out as he leant back in the old wooden chair, which made a squeaking noise on the weight being pushed against it for the first time in a century.</p><p>“But do you think you can just stay here? We found you so easily and some people at different harbors are talking more and more about the night visits,” Kochi added.</p><p>“I guess if we get too suspicious we just have to keep moving. We only came here, because it was a place Hokuto remembered.”</p><p>“But do you want to spend your entire life hiding like this?” Jesse asked. “I mean I wouldn’t be able to live like this.”</p><p>“Of course you wouldn’t be able to, we would hear you complain about how boring it is out here in like two hours and that all the way from the mainland,” Shintaro teased.</p><p>“Well, I have a library that can keep me busy for a lifetime,” Taiga joked.</p><p>“For your lifetime,” Kochi said, but he had said it more to himself yet Taiga had of course heard him.</p><p>“Can I ask something as well?” Juri asked a bit more serious and Taiga nodded. “If you don’t want to go into details please just say so, I was just wondering, because after what you said about you and Hokuto spending so much time together and even running away together. Are you two, you know…?”</p><p>Taiga immediately caught up to his thought, but wasn’t sure what to reply as he sank a bit awkwardly back into his chair.</p><p>“Well I guess that reaction explains enough,” Kochi said and got up, while Jesse and Shintaro hadn’t even caught up to what exactly Juri had tried to ask. “We should head back before the weather changes.”</p><p>That announcement had the others whine a bit, but he was of course right.</p><p>“You’re welcome to visit again if you want to.”</p><p>That offer hadn’t come from Taiga and it had surprised them all when Hokuto had been the one to offer it and he actually dared to step into the room as some clouds had hidden the sunlight, a sign that had Kochi made them hurry to leave before heavy winds could come up.</p><p>Jesse and Shintaro immediately cheered on that offer while Taiga wasn’t even sure what to say. He wasn’t against it, but it was also hard to tell if Hokuto really meant what he said.</p><p>“You can also come visit us if you want?” Juri offered to their surprise as he also got up, Taiga moving over to Hokuto, checking if he was really okay with walking around at daytime after not getting much rest.</p><p>“We could help you get supplies too. Then the people at the harbors won’t be that suspicious anymore,” Jesse offered.</p><p>“That would actually be amazing,” Taiga let out as he feared that people could really become too suspicious about them soon.</p><p>“Just one warning,” Hokuto added when the boys already got ready to leave and they all looked a bit more serious on the way Hokuto stepped in front of Taiga. “If you betray my trust I can assure you that it will be the last thing you will ever do.”</p><p>The warning was clear, but the boys only nodded as they hadn’t offered anything lightly after encountering Hokuto and getting back to their town alive thanks to Taiga. After all, Taiga hadn’t made it a secret that Hokuto had been betrayed by humans before and that he would if necessary kill even if it was against Taiga’s wishes.</p><p>It was Kochi who stepped to the front with a serious expression next. “We only met and I know that you won’t easily trust humans, but after I have heard your story I can promise you that I would never harm any of you and that not because of the threat you could be to me and the people around me, but because I think you deserve a chance to become happy like anyone else.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Do you believe them?”</p><p>“Would I have offered them to come back if I didn’t?” Hokuto asked when the boys had left right before the weather seemed to really turn into a small storm outside.</p><p>“I feel like you offered so that I wouldn’t go and meet them on the mainland especially at daytime,” Taiga teased as he sat down on his bed after he had urged Hokuto to sleep some more as the day was stressful enough for both of them and when Hokuto suddenly almost threw himself on top of Taiga and pulled him into his embrace with no escape, Taiga chuckled on his clingy behavior. “Look, I’m right.”</p><p>“Never said you weren’t,” Hokuto let out as he rested his chin on the other one’s hair while he refused to let go, but Taiga enjoyed the clingy behavior and he pulled himself against Hokuto’s chest. It still felt so weird that Hokuto’s body felt this warm against his even though he couldn’t find a heartbeat even with his ear against the other one’s chest. Something that had freaked him out the moment he had realized it the first time, while it had been something completely natural for Hokuto. But Taiga hadn’t asked more about it, because his questions about a vampire’s physical features would turn endless if he ever started asking and he was sure that Hokuto didn’t really have any logical explanations for his own body.</p><p>“So are we going to meet them on the mainland for supplies next week?” Taiga asked after Kochi had offered to bring some supplies to a place off the harbor. But when Taiga didn’t get a reply he pushed himself a bit to the back and the loose grip around his body showed him that Hokuto had indeed fallen asleep.</p><p>“The all so mighty vampire got too stressed out by some human boys,” Taiga teased as he snuggled back against the other one’s chest as he could understand that Hokuto had been on high alert the entire day since the boys had arrived. No matter how calm he tried to seem it had all only be a facade. He didn’t necessarily trust the boys, but he wanted to help Taiga get back into contact with humans and if that meant taking the risk of letting those boys get closer then he would gladly take it, but that also meant that Taiga had to take more care of him or he would be too weak to actually protect him in case some real danger would really approach them.</p><p>***</p><p>“You didn’t even stay ten minutes,” Shintaro complained.</p><p>“Be happy that Hokuto even bothered saying thank you,” Taiga laughed as he took another box of bread from Shintaro and put it on the counter of the kitchen.</p><p>They had met with the boys near the harbor a week after their first encounter, but Hokuto had been too restless to actually stay for long, so a week later when the weather had been good enough for the boys do dare their way out once more, they had come to visit them with more supplies this time.</p><p>“Is he this grumpy with you as well?” Jesse asked as he bit into an apple that he had actually brought for Taiga, but after paddling all the way out with quite some waves he had become hungry as well.</p><p>“Not really,” Taiga said as he knew a completely different side of Hokuto.</p><p>“So he is asleep now, right?” Juri asked as he rolled a barrel with fresh water into the room. “Isn’t it quite difficult for you to even get a good rhythm to spend time with each other?”</p><p>“Well I try to stay awake as long as possible and he tries to wake up early so usually we have the evening hours up until late at night, but I can’t deny that it took some time to get used to it.”</p><p>“Did he ever tell you if there were others?” Kochi asked as he put the last supplies on the table and leant back at it with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>Taiga thought about it for a moment, but while he had of course heard more details about Hokuto’s past and also knew that some vampires had been killed in the massacre that had happened, they hadn’t talked much about others.</p><p>“He said that they usually only come together when there is a threat,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“So I guess him getting into trouble with some humans is still not seen as a threat for them,” Juri said. “But who knows if they’d even easily know if someone was in trouble?”</p><p>Again a question Taiga couldn’t find an answer to and he felt like he didn’t know as much about Hokuto as he wanted to.</p><p>“How about you come with us the next time we visit?” Jesse suddenly asked, Shintaro immediately getting excited about the idea. “I mean just to explore for a day or two and then Hokuto can pick you up or we can bring you back?”</p><p>“Just if you feel like it of course,” Kochi added, but it was clear that he wanted to say if Hokuto felt like it. Taiga wasn’t that bothered about Hokuto being overprotective as he had rescued Taiga from certain death, but would he allow a trip to the mainland without being able to be around at daytime?</p><p>“I’ll talk about it with Hokuto,” Taiga promised.</p><p>“By the way, can we look a bit more around the castle? Last time we were kind of shaken after meeting Hokuto and we didn’t really see much,” Shintaro reminded him and Taiga wouldn’t stop them.</p><p>“Just don’t enter my room, okay? Hokuto won’t be as forgiving as me if he gets woken up. So if you’re on his floor, make sure to be quiet.”</p><p>Jesse and Shintaro immediately nodded and dashed out of the room, Kochi excusing himself as he had a bad feeling about leaving them alone so he followed them for now.</p><p>“Are you not going to explore with them?” Taiga asked as he turned to Juri who helped put away the food for now.</p><p>“Maybe later,” the boy said and Taiga helped with the remaining supplies.</p><p>“Thank you so much for bringing all this heavy stuff up here. We really appreciate it.”</p><p>“You do, I’m sure of it,” Juri said a bit coldly. “It’s not like Hokuto needs any of the food.”</p><p>“But he was the one to bring the first food without me even asking,” Taiga said with a nostalgic smile.</p><p>“But do you really think he will keep caring for your human needs?”</p><p>Taiga had not seen the question as offensive, yet he could see that Juri seemed more concerned than the others about Taiga’s situation.</p><p>“He has been in this world for so long, I don’t think he will easily get bored of me as for him my human lifetime is just a blink of an eye,” Taiga said as he sat half on the table, facing Juri.</p><p>“But is that really a life you want? Away from other humans, always on the run? I feel like you are sacrificing way more than him here.”</p><p>“Let me think about that if I ever feel like living with him is a sacrifice in any way,” Taiga let out with a soft smile and finally Juri’s expression also turned a bit more relaxed.</p><p>“I guess it wasn’t my place to judge in the first place, sorry about that.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I can understand that everything is a bit confusing and strange to you. But I am really happy that you decided to protect our secret and still came back to visit while you could have just ignored us.”</p><p>A loud noise interrupted them before Juri could reply, but it hadn’t been from inside the castle and Taiga walked out to the corridor first as he had of course recognized the sound of thunder. Juri followed him towards the next balcony and they weren’t surprised when rain greeted them as they stepped outside.</p><p>“Well here we are back to our bad weather changes,” Juri said as he looked down to the water and the waves were already getting higher through the wind the storm had brought. “We should immediately leave or we won’t make it back today.”</p><p>“Don’t you think with your small boat you should wait until the weather calms down? The castle is huge and has many rooms you can stay overnight if you want?”</p><p>Juri seemed to give it a thought and when a bright lighting came down right over the water before the mainland he sighed. “I guess if we don’t want to risk our lives on the way back we should indeed wait.”</p><p>“Perfect, let’s find you some quarters for tonight. But I fear you have to clean the rooms a bit, they might be quite dusty.”</p><p>They boys didn't mind cleaning and especially Shintaro and Jesse had been excited to stay longer at the castle.</p><p>“Look at these clothes,” Jesse laughed as he put a way too old looking blue tailcoat over his shoulders as he looked through the old closet of the room he had chosen for the night while Shintaro had helped him clean the room after they had been done with his.</p><p>“We should bring Taiga some clothes the next time, I feel sorry for him wearing all these old clothes,” Shintaro said on the sight of the old wardrobe. “I wonder if Hokuto would also like some new clothes? Do vampires change clothes?”</p><p>“I guess so?” Jesse said shrugging his shoulders after he put the clothes back and walked up to get a lamp from the nightstand to turn it on as it had turned dark outside, not just through the rain clouds.</p><p>“Let’s see how the others are doing?” Jesse suggested and they left the room to make it to Juri and Kochi who had chosen two rooms on the other side of the corridor as they were sure that the two boys wouldn’t sleep much and keep running forth and back between their rooms.</p><p>“Wow that I call a library,” Shintaro said as he stopped at an open door which he hadn't paid much attention to yet on this floor and he stepped into the room with the high ceiling. By now even the window wasn’t really offering them any light and only the lamp Jesse was carrying showed them how tall the shelves in the room were.</p><p>Jesse went up to one shelf and read some of the covers. “Macbeth? I can’t even read this one, is this French? How old is this library?”</p><p>“I doubt it’s just the fact that some books are old, but more the fact that you’ve never even once actually read a book in your life that you don’t know any of them,” Shintaro laughed as he kept moving and found another corridor and waved Jesse over as he couldn’t see anything without the lamb.</p><p>“Oh wow, it’s like a secret reading room,” Shintaro said as he moved over to the armchair and sat down like a nobleman, holding one of the books which had been tossed on the floor next to it. While Shintaro was amused by what he had found, Jesse felt slightly uncomfortable at the sight of some piles of books on the table and around the armchair.</p><p>“I feel like we shouldn’t be in here somehow,” Jesse let out.</p><p>“Taiga said to stay away from his bedroom, right? This is definitely not it,” Shintaro interfered, but while Jesse turned towards the corridor with a fast movement as if he had seen something, but wasn’t sure the next moment anymore as he couldn’t really see much more than what the light surrounded, Shintaro kept skimming through one of the books.</p><p>“They seem to keep the interesting books back here. I wonder if this is Taiga’s taste or actually Hokuto’s?”</p><p>“Want to find out?”</p><p>Shintaro looked up at Jesse first, but the boy had turned back to Shintaro on those words as they hadn’t come from him and then Shintaro screamed, almost jumping into Jesse’s arms as he felt the presence right behind the armchair without even having to turn around. Jesse had only started screaming, because of Shintaro’s reaction, but now he had to watch out to not let the lamp drop.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Kochi yelled from behind Taiga who had run towards the library first as he had already guessed from where the voices were coming.</p><p>“We were just exploring,” Shintaro said while he was clinging to Jesse as if his life was depending on it. “But then he showed up out of nowhere.”</p><p>With a shaking hand Shintaro pointed towards the dark corner, silver eyes shining from the dark and both boys still seemed too shocked to actually move.</p><p>“You might need some more time to get used to Hokuto’s way of having fun,” Taiga said as he stepped behind the armchair and instead of him pulling Hokuto out of the dark, the boy had actually pulled him towards the corner, leaving him out of sight to everyone for a moment.</p><p>Jesse wanted to lift the light more towards the corner, but Kochi immediately put his hand on his with a warning look. They had decided on not waking Hokuto up while preparing for their stay so they could be grateful that the boy had such sharp senses and had obviously known exactly who was in the castle when he had woken up, so he had made another game out of it.</p><p>When he finally stepped a bit towards the light with an amused expression, Taiga gave him a scolding look, but the way his cheeks were also a bit flushed Kochi realized that Hokuto didn’t need much privacy and didn’t mind if they knew more about the way they were living together.</p><p>“You should apologize,” Kochi told the two boys, but to his surprise they both pouted.</p><p>“Shouldn’t he apologize for always scaring us?” Shintaro asked back, but when he pointed at Hokuto this time, the boy walked up to him with fast steps, resulting with Shintaro squealing and almost jumping into Jesse’s arms once more.</p><p>“If I ever make you cry then I will apologize,” Hokuto teased, but Taiga hit him on the arm on that comment and pulled him back.</p><p>“You want them to fear you that much?” Taiga scolded him before his look turned a bit softer. “We didn’t want to wake you up. The weather turned too bad for them to head back today, do you mind if they stay for the night?”</p><p>Hokuto seemed to think about it for a moment before he turned towards Taiga and caressed the boy’s cheek. “As long as they can deal with our nighttime activities.”</p><p>Taiga rolled his eyes on the way Hokuto enjoyed making the others feel uncomfortable and this time even Jesse and Shintaro got the hint.</p><p>“We’ll not disturb you at all. It’s late after all we should head back to our rooms,” Shintaro said in a hurry and started pushing Jesse towards the corridor. “Let’s see where Juri is and make sure he’s also not disturbing them.”</p><p>“As if he’d be that oblivious about it,” Kochi said with another sigh. “Please excuse them. They are just getting too carried away sometimes.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I am happy that they are not getting angry at Hokuto,” Taiga replied.</p><p>“Don’t make me the bad guy here,” Hokuto interfered as he put his arm around the other one’s shoulder and this time Kochi also stepped back as he realized how much Hokuto kept putting his hands on Taiga.</p><p>“We’ll make sure to leave as early as possible tomorrow if the weather has calmed down by then. We won’t wake you up if you’re still asleep at that time.”</p><p>“You better don’t,” Hokuto replied in a playful way and Taiga gave Kochi another apologizing smile on the way Hokuto enjoyed this way too much and when Kochi finally left the library Taiga had no time to even scold Hokuto, as the boy turned him around and gave him a rushed kiss.</p><p>“Did you sleep so well that you have too much energy now or did you not sleep well enough?” Taiga asked when he was released again, but he didn’t get an immediate reply when Hokuto moved his lips down to the other one’s neck instead and Taiga shivered a bit when he could already feel Hokuto’s fangs out on his skin.</p><p>“Let’s say I feel more energetic through some extra company,” Hokuto whispered before he buried his fangs in the other one’s skin without any warning. The sudden action had taken Taiga by such a surprise that he had gasped and clenched his hands into the other one’s shirt.</p><p>Maybe energetic wasn’t the right word, threatened was definitely the better choice and Taiga couldn’t even judge him. Hokuto had definitely realized that the boys were in the castle and still he had given them some space until the evening hours, but with them staying in the castle, no matter if threat to them or not, he was on such high alert that he intuitively felt like he needed even more strength to stay alerted so his thirst resulted from that.</p><p>While Taiga had often fainted at first after the pain had been too much for him he had slowly gotten used to being bitten and while he needed to support himself a bit on Hokuto’s shoulders when the other one pulled back there was still not much exhaustion taking over his body as before.</p><p>“Calmer now?” Taiga asked as he of course understood the boy’s action the best and the way Hokuto lifted Taiga up and actually carried him over to their room instead of using the armchair like so often, showed that he had adjusted to Taiga’s human needs a lot. Something Juri was still quite worried about, but Taiga enjoyed watching Hokuto change and adjust his behavior, not that he would judge him if he couldn’t do it sometimes and didn’t understand some of Taiga’s needs.</p><p>One of those needs was a rest after a long day, especially after Hokuto had bitten him, but he would never complain when he got Hokuto’s full attention and he enjoyed the way Hokuto touched him so much softer now, almost like he feared he could break him just through his touch.</p><p>“I will never be calm when I have to share you,” Hokuto finally replied to the previous question, making Taiga smile as he didn’t really have to share him, just maybe some hours a day if the boys came by more often and definitely not in the way he feared.</p><p>“Do you want to go with them?” Hokuto asked as he was obviously still too tense to let his guard down completely for the night, but Taiga enjoyed the intense looks he was getting and the light touches on his body. It wasn’t like they would only enjoy rough body contact all the time.</p><p>“You were awake after all,” Taiga scolded the other one as he pulled Hokuto down on the sheets so that he would lie down next to him. Taiga wasn’t too exhausted so he wouldn’t immediately need to sleep, but he wasn’t awake enough to have complicated talks either.</p><p>“Would you be okay with it?”</p><p>“It will be tough to be out at daytime, but I can handle it,” Hokuto replied, but that was the reply Taiga had already seen coming and he put his hand to the other one’s face.</p><p>“Don’t you think I can handle one or two days in their town on my own?”</p><p>“Oh so you already want to get away from me?” The teasing was obvious in Hokuto’s voice, but Taiga could also see the worry. Hokuto would never trust humans, maybe he would not even trust Taiga fully no matter how long they stayed together, but at some point Taiga would need to speak up for himself and make sure that Hokuto wouldn’t go as far as exhaust himself to a dangerous degree at daytime just to look out for him.</p><p>“How about we start with a nighttime visit first, but no running off after a few minutes, okay? We will stay until sunrise,” Taiga declared without giving Hokuto a choice, but the boy seemed to agree as he finally ran out of patience and moved closer to pull the other one into another greedy kiss.</p><p>“Fine, if you say so.”</p><p>Taiga chuckled on the way Hokuto agreed while he would obviously love to decline and Taiga hoped he could make the others feel more relaxed around Hokuto like this as well. After all, Hokuto needed to take a step towards humans as well if he wanted them to actually accept his kind instead of fearing them like in the past.</p>
