    <h1>Animus Noctis - Spirit Of The Night</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/stormy1990/pseuds/stormy1990">stormy1990</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In the 18th century noblemen played a big part in Great Britain’s economy and trading expansion. In this Age of Enlightenment a lot of commoners dreamed about being part of the nobility, attending balls, meeting and trading with other countries and experiencing other cultures. For Taiga this life felt like a cage he couldn’t escape from and as he approached adulthood his family dreamed of nothing more than to make sure their legacy would be in good hands with a strong bond to another noblemen family. While Taiga had played along as long as he could all he was looking for was a way out. What he found when he finally dared to step out of his overprotective lifestyle was maybe more than he was able to handle, but it would also show him a world he didn’t even think of existing as all he had known so far was the human lifestyle. But discovering this eternal path brought a lot of trouble and consequences towards them both and now his last decision to make was if his new found connection to this eternal being was strong enough to make him want to tag along for his own eternity.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've been on this fic for 2 years and am so excited to finally post it!</p><p>I once wrote a vampire fic similar to this one, so yes if you find parallels then that is bc I wanted to add a few of the same dynamics, but I also wanted to switch the roles.<br/>This was supposed to be a one-shot, now it is a huge multi-chapter. It has a mix of everything. Comedy, action, angst, a bit of horror. I wrote this without any outline at all so I hope you will enjoy reading this chaos.</p><p>As always be prepared for grammar/spelling mistakes and plot holes.</p><p>Hope you'll have fun reading^^/</p></blockquote>

</p><p> </p><p>+++</p><p>1742 - Great Britain</p><p>+++</p><p> </p><p>"Young lord, how often do I have to tell you that you're not allowed outside alone at this hour."</p><p>Well she didn't have to tell him, because he was well aware. Aware of all the stupid overprotective rules his father had established over the years. The cause? None at all.</p><p>Their city was lively, but not dangerous. There was barely any crime at all and while Taiga's family was indeed of high status it wasn't like people disliked them or would give them any reason to worry for their safety.</p><p>Yet Taiga had always felt trapped, not just in his own way too spacious house, but also in the city itself. If he wasn't out with his family he always had someone from the house being at his side. Not even once had he been wandering around alone, at least that is what the maids and guards thought and told his parents.</p><p>Exactly one of those unknown moments had been discovered this time as he had tried to sneak out the house when everyone was asleep. Only at nighttime he could somehow experience some freedom.</p><p>Luckily he had always been prepared getting caught so he came up with a well thought through story of insomnia and sleepwalking which made the maid of the house worry for him enough to not scold him any further.</p><p>As his plans had been discovered that night he made the maid believe he had gone back to bed, but he could at least sneak out to his balcony as it wasn’t really a place away from their house.</p><p>Of course even at such a simple place his parents had always worried for him as well, because he could fall. When he had been a child he could still understand those worries, but with the years the rules got more and more ridiculous and now that he was about to become a young adult he felt like a prisoner in his own house, which actually turned him into a disobedient son, but of course without the knowledge of his father.</p><p>When Taiga stepped out on the balcony it was already right before dawn and he sat on the stone wall from which it was a good five meter fall to the ground floor. It would usually be enough to just stand on the balcony and there was absolutely no reason for him to sit down on the stone wall instead, but that was the disobedience he'd come to find a liking of even if no one was there to actually see it.</p><p>In the distance the fog over the valley slowly cleared away as the first sunbeams made it over the high mountains around the valley.</p><p>Their city was actually the last big one before the valley turned into a mountain chain so high that even though it was spring already the highest peaks were still white.</p><p>So often had he wondered what was beyond those mountains, but never had he gotten the chance to see for himself.</p><p>If they went somewhere then it was the other direction to the even bigger cities, his father always busy with work and Taiga not even in the mood to explore the cities, because after all it was always the same.</p><p>It was a few days later when his father announced that he would head out for a business trip and left the choice to Taiga if he wanted to join. Trying to find a polite excuse he refused, because he didn’t want to cause his father any trouble on the journey and luckily his father seemed more than happy about his wise choice as he had lied about wanting to focus on studying.</p><p>His mother was joining the trip so he ended up being alone at the house for the first time in a while. Of course there were still a few maids and guards around, but Taiga was used to sneaking away from them.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to try and eat something?” The maid tried again, but Taiga shook his head with a played painful expression.</p><p>He had made up a story about having a fever and a stomach ache to make the maids believe he would be in his room for the rest of the day. “It would be great if you could head to the city to get some medicine, but please let me rest for the day. I will come downstairs and pick them up later.”</p><p>Of course the maid nodded understanding and closed the door on which Taiga smiled and jumped out of bed, fully dressed already, because he didn’t want to waste any time.</p><p>He climbed down from his balcony as he knew his way down without falling, at least now and he made his way to the stables, watching out that no one would be around before he saddled his horse and rushed up a mountain path close to the house with his black mare before anyone could spot him.</p><p>“That was easier than expected,” Taiga said smiling to himself as he kept cantering up the path leading away from the city. Luckily it was still early enough so that no people crossed his way as a lot of them worked in the woods. Just through their work Taiga had spotted this path in the first place, but of course he had never been allowed on it.</p><p>At his usual short night escapes he had never dared to make his way up the mountain, after all even with a lamp he wouldn’t have been able to see enough and there wouldn’t have been anything to see from the top of the mountain in the middle of the night.</p><p>This time though he had gotten a pretty awesome opportunity so finally see what was behind their mountain range even though it was pretty cold in the morning, but at least it was sunny and for now Taiga could ignore the clouds coming in from the north as he would be long down the mountain again before they could reach the city.</p><p>He had made it more than half way up the mountain already when the path in front of him seemed to get more narrow with every passing minute until his mare didn’t seem comfortable to keep going as she kept spooking each time the plants around them kept brushing her legs.</p><p>“Seems like your part of the trip ends here,” Taiga said as he got off and decided to leave his horse behind and let her grass until he would come back to pick her up. He only wanted to take a look anyway and even if he walked he was sure he’d be back in less than two hours. It didn’t seem like the workers would usually follow the path this deep into the mountains in the first place.</p><p>The hike got more difficult towards the top and none of his clothes and especially not his shoes were actually made for an adventure like this. High black boots and uncomfortable cotton pants with a white shirt which was definitely going to be a different color on his way back had been a bad choice of clothes, but most of his other clothes were even more uncomfortable and too expensive to actually risk an outburst from his father if he got dirt on them.</p><p>Towards the peak of the mountain the trees slowly got less, but instead a lot of rocks blocked the path and he needed to actually start climbing if he wanted to somehow make it out of the forest and up to the open peak.</p><p>After a few more minutes of cursing and bruises on his hands, which he had to find excuses for later he had finally made it to the peak.</p><p>For someone who had the freedom to come up here as often as they wanted to, it was maybe a normal view, but for Taiga it was fascinating. On one side he could see their city, still covered with a light morning fog. On the other side of the valley the huge white peaks didn’t seem that high anymore now that he was up high as well, but the dark clouds behind them seemed to rush over to the valley even faster now.</p><p>When he turned to the other side all he could see was mountains. One after the other, one bigger than the first one! It wasn’t like he would be thrilled about walking along a mountain range for days, sleeping in the dirt and most likely feeling cold all the time, but it was still a magnificent view!</p><p>Not wanting to leave right away, Taiga sat down on one of the big rocks and just enjoyed the view. The closer he looked the more he was able to spot. There were paths through the thick forest leading away from the city, but they had obviously not been used in years, as it was hard to even spot them. Then his look wandered off to a smaller mountain in between, it was somehow hard to spot with all the white peaks around. A dark fir forest grew over that mountain while the other mountains had a lot of different types of trees, some of them now also showing flowers and bright green leaves.</p><p>Then Taiga spotted something even weirder about that mountain, there was a building on it! Only a part the roof was visible between the dark trees and Taiga couldn’t spot any path leading to it. While he had said he wouldn’t be up for a hiking trip this was a complete different matter. Something made him focus on that hidden building as if it wasn’t supposed to be found. He would need to get down from this peak and climb up to that small mountain again and while it didn’t seem too much of a steep hike there was also no direct path so he would need to make it through the thick forest, which could cost him a lot of time.</p><p>For a moment he turned towards the city, but it was still so silent down there, still too early in the morning to see more than a few carriages on the streets.</p><p>“Guess the only thing that could happen is me getting soaked on the way back,” Taiga said with another look up to the sky before he tried to find the easiest way down.</p><p>On his way off the mountain he still had a small path he could follow, but as expected it lead towards the opposite direction on the bottom, away from the dark forest.</p><p>Maybe it was the missing sunlight on this side of the mountain, but suddenly Taiga felt a lot colder.</p><p>Not knowing where the easiest way up would be, he just went straight up, hoping he could make it to the peak without any big obstacles. To his luck there seemed to be nothing, but a few old trees lying in his way. Some of them looking like they had been cut down by men to make the mountain more accessible, but that had been definitely years ago.</p><p>There was something that he noticed after stopping to take a break for a moment. On his way up to the first mountain with his horse he had spotted a few deer and even on the peak he had heard and seen some birds, yet on this mountain it was silent, way too silent. Not knowing why a shiver went through his body and he had to laugh at himself when he realized the goosebumps on his arms, maybe he should have actually worn a jacket with the low morning temperatures.</p><p>The peak of the mountain came into sight sooner than he had expected and then he also finally spotted the house. “Well that's what I call taste,” Taiga said, but the irony was obvious.</p><p>The building in front of him seemed as if it had been there for at least one century, maybe even longer. It didn’t look too damaged, but it also didn’t look inviting, at all. It was made out of black stones which was pretty unusual, at least if compared to all the cities Taiga had been in.</p><p>Carefully Taiga moved around the house, it was bigger than he had expected it to be. It had a pretty high roof, which was also black and the walls were high enough for two floors and around the corner was a small staircase up to a wooden double door.</p><p>The windows weren’t broken to his surprise, but a lot of weed was growing over them and they were so high up that Taiga wasn’t able to look inside anyway.</p><p>Taiga walked up the stairs as if he had been actually invited to this place before he knocked with one of the black heavy iron rings. The sound echoing through the building sounded as if it had a pretty high ceiling inside, but the house remained silent.</p><p>“Idiot,” Taiga said to himself with a chuckle. “Did you really expect someone to live here?”</p><p>No of course he hadn’t, which made him squeal even louder when something inside the house was heard. A sound like something had been tossed to the ground and Taiga jumped down the stairs. Then the house fell silent again.</p><p>The next thing to happen had him growl in annoyance, when the first rain drops hit him. “Really now?” After he complained the rain started to get even heavier in the matter of minutes until Taiga had to make a decision. Go home in the heavy rain or just try if the door of the building was actually open so he could see if the rain stopped after a while again.</p><p>With the sky getting even darker and lighting and thunder joining the heavy rain Taiga had enough and he hurried back up the stairs and pulled on the heavy wooden doors which moved with an obnoxious squeaking noise, almost sounding like someone screaming.</p><p>Taiga left the door open as he was faced with a pitch black entrance hall. While the building didn’t seem to have taken any damage from the outside it was different for the inside. But it wasn’t time itself which had brought destruction to the interior. Chairs had been ripped apart, vases and mirrors smashed to the ground. Maybe there had been thieves in here over the years, after all Taiga had definitely not been the first person to dare his way to this abandoned house.</p><p>He knew he should just wait at the door for the rain to stop yet he walked further into the entrance hall the same way he had been somehow dragged to this building in the first place he felt like he wanted to explore it more.</p><p>A heavy thunder made him jolt and he made a step back towards the door. Maybe the weather was a bad omen? Shouldn’t he have come to this place? But on the other hand the weather was at fault for him having to seek shelter.</p><p>After the thunder everything fell silent again until Taiga had the weird feeling of hearing something. The heavy rain made it hard to actually hear anything in particular and he wasn’t even sure if it was his imagination.</p><p>With the next lightning he had a better view of the room and he spotted a double staircase to a second floor and right before the room fell dark again he spotted something else, or more...like someone else?</p><p>It had been too short to be sure, he had only seen some shape that could have been some furniture or something else standing around the top of the staircase, which could easily been mistaken with a human, because of its size.</p><p>Always forgetting that thunder would follow after lightning, Taiga jolted again and made a step to the back on which he stepped on a few broken parts of the smashed mirror.</p><p>Then once more it was only the rain, or not? Again he felt like he was hearing something, but maybe he was mistaken, maybe it wasn’t actually a sound he was searching for? It was more of a feeling, something that let the hairs of his neck stand up since a few minutes ago and made his legs feel heavy. Something like a presence.</p><p>While he couldn’t see anything at all in the pitch black room he wanted to back off, to make it closer to the door, yet he felt how his legs seemed to get even heavier.</p><p>He had never been at such a place before so maybe it was natural to feel scared, especially with the weather adding an extra scare factor, but something told him that he wasn’t actually supposed to be THIS scared of an empty old building.</p><p>Just when he somehow managed to make another step backwards another lightning stroke. This time he didn’t even need to look around, this time he was left screaming when someone was standing so close to him that he could have actually touched him. But all he wanted to do was run as whoever that was, whatever that was didn’t actually look friendly. Cold, silver shining eyes had been staring at him from under a black hood and the moment the thunder hit and the room fell dark Taiga screamed again and turned, aiming for the door on shaking legs.</p><p>He slipped and fell hands first into the pieces of the mirror. A cut hand was the least he would whine about now though and all he wanted to was leave. It felt like it took him an eternity to make it to the door. His body feeling heavy, almost paralyzed as he finally got to the door. On unsteady feet he dashed out into the rain, completely forgetting about the staircase and stumbling down until he fell to his knees on the grass in front of the house.</p><p>Again he could hear it, like a voice from within. He knew that whatever was living inside that house was watching him and he didn’t dare to even turn around before he started running down the mountain through the thick forest.</p><p>This hadn’t been the adventure he had been seeking and now he would never be able to unsee. But to unsee what? What had he just seen? How could he not just say this was a human who played a pretty bad prank on him?</p><p>Whatever was living in that building was not human. So Taiga could only hope that it wouldn’t hunt him down, because he was sure he wouldn’t make it out alive!</p>
