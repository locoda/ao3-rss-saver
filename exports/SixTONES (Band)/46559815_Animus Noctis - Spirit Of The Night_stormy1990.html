    <h1>Animus Noctis - Spirit Of The Night</h1>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In the 18th century noblemen played a big part in Great Britain’s economy and trading expansion. In this Age of Enlightenment a lot of commoners dreamed about being part of the nobility, attending balls, meeting and trading with other countries and experiencing other cultures. For Taiga this life felt like a cage he couldn’t escape from and as he approached adulthood his family dreamed of nothing more than to make sure their legacy would be in good hands with a strong bond to another noblemen family. While Taiga had played along as long as he could all he was looking for was a way out. What he found when he finally dared to step out of his overprotective lifestyle was maybe more than he was able to handle, but it would also show him a world he didn’t even think of existing as all he had known so far was the human lifestyle. But discovering this eternal path brought a lot of trouble and consequences towards them both and now his last decision to make was if his new found connection to this eternal being was strong enough to make him want to tag along for his own eternity.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I've been on this fic for 2 years and am so excited to finally post it!</p><p>I once wrote a vampire fic similar to this one, so yes if you find parallels then that is bc I wanted to add a few of the same dynamics, but I also wanted to switch the roles.<br/>This was supposed to be a one-shot, now it is a huge multi-chapter. It has a mix of everything. Comedy, action, angst, a bit of horror. I wrote this without any outline at all so I hope you will enjoy reading this chaos.</p><p>As always be prepared for grammar/spelling mistakes and plot holes.</p><p>Hope you'll have fun reading^^/</p></blockquote>

</p><p> </p><p>+++</p><p>1742 - Great Britain</p><p>+++</p><p> </p><p>"Young lord, how often do I have to tell you that you're not allowed outside alone at this hour."</p><p>Well she didn't have to tell him, because he was well aware. Aware of all the stupid overprotective rules his father had established over the years. The cause? None at all.</p><p>Their city was lively, but not dangerous. There was barely any crime at all and while Taiga's family was indeed of high status it wasn't like people disliked them or would give them any reason to worry for their safety.</p><p>Yet Taiga had always felt trapped, not just in his own way too spacious house, but also in the city itself. If he wasn't out with his family he always had someone from the house being at his side. Not even once had he been wandering around alone, at least that is what the maids and guards thought and told his parents.</p><p>Exactly one of those unknown moments had been discovered this time as he had tried to sneak out the house when everyone was asleep. Only at nighttime he could somehow experience some freedom.</p><p>Luckily he had always been prepared getting caught so he came up with a well thought through story of insomnia and sleepwalking which made the maid of the house worry for him enough to not scold him any further.</p><p>As his plans had been discovered that night he made the maid believe he had gone back to bed, but he could at least sneak out to his balcony as it wasn’t really a place away from their house.</p><p>Of course even at such a simple place his parents had always worried for him as well, because he could fall. When he had been a child he could still understand those worries, but with the years the rules got more and more ridiculous and now that he was about to become a young adult he felt like a prisoner in his own house, which actually turned him into a disobedient son, but of course without the knowledge of his father.</p><p>When Taiga stepped out on the balcony it was already right before dawn and he sat on the stone wall from which it was a good five meter fall to the ground floor. It would usually be enough to just stand on the balcony and there was absolutely no reason for him to sit down on the stone wall instead, but that was the disobedience he'd come to find a liking of even if no one was there to actually see it.</p><p>In the distance the fog over the valley slowly cleared away as the first sunbeams made it over the high mountains around the valley.</p><p>Their city was actually the last big one before the valley turned into a mountain chain so high that even though it was spring already the highest peaks were still white.</p><p>So often had he wondered what was beyond those mountains, but never had he gotten the chance to see for himself.</p><p>If they went somewhere then it was the other direction to the even bigger cities, his father always busy with work and Taiga not even in the mood to explore the cities, because after all it was always the same.</p><p>It was a few days later when his father announced that he would head out for a business trip and left the choice to Taiga if he wanted to join. Trying to find a polite excuse he refused, because he didn’t want to cause his father any trouble on the journey and luckily his father seemed more than happy about his wise choice as he had lied about wanting to focus on studying.</p><p>His mother was joining the trip so he ended up being alone at the house for the first time in a while. Of course there were still a few maids and guards around, but Taiga was used to sneaking away from them.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want to try and eat something?” The maid tried again, but Taiga shook his head with a played painful expression.</p><p>He had made up a story about having a fever and a stomach ache to make the maids believe he would be in his room for the rest of the day. “It would be great if you could head to the city to get some medicine, but please let me rest for the day. I will come downstairs and pick them up later.”</p><p>Of course the maid nodded understanding and closed the door on which Taiga smiled and jumped out of bed, fully dressed already, because he didn’t want to waste any time.</p><p>He climbed down from his balcony as he knew his way down without falling, at least now and he made his way to the stables, watching out that no one would be around before he saddled his horse and rushed up a mountain path close to the house with his black mare before anyone could spot him.</p><p>“That was easier than expected,” Taiga said smiling to himself as he kept cantering up the path leading away from the city. Luckily it was still early enough so that no people crossed his way as a lot of them worked in the woods. Just through their work Taiga had spotted this path in the first place, but of course he had never been allowed on it.</p><p>At his usual short night escapes he had never dared to make his way up the mountain, after all even with a lamp he wouldn’t have been able to see enough and there wouldn’t have been anything to see from the top of the mountain in the middle of the night.</p><p>This time though he had gotten a pretty awesome opportunity so finally see what was behind their mountain range even though it was pretty cold in the morning, but at least it was sunny and for now Taiga could ignore the clouds coming in from the north as he would be long down the mountain again before they could reach the city.</p><p>He had made it more than half way up the mountain already when the path in front of him seemed to get more narrow with every passing minute until his mare didn’t seem comfortable to keep going as she kept spooking each time the plants around them kept brushing her legs.</p><p>“Seems like your part of the trip ends here,” Taiga said as he got off and decided to leave his horse behind and let her grass until he would come back to pick her up. He only wanted to take a look anyway and even if he walked he was sure he’d be back in less than two hours. It didn’t seem like the workers would usually follow the path this deep into the mountains in the first place.</p><p>The hike got more difficult towards the top and none of his clothes and especially not his shoes were actually made for an adventure like this. High black boots and uncomfortable cotton pants with a white shirt which was definitely going to be a different color on his way back had been a bad choice of clothes, but most of his other clothes were even more uncomfortable and too expensive to actually risk an outburst from his father if he got dirt on them.</p><p>Towards the peak of the mountain the trees slowly got less, but instead a lot of rocks blocked the path and he needed to actually start climbing if he wanted to somehow make it out of the forest and up to the open peak.</p><p>After a few more minutes of cursing and bruises on his hands, which he had to find excuses for later he had finally made it to the peak.</p><p>For someone who had the freedom to come up here as often as they wanted to, it was maybe a normal view, but for Taiga it was fascinating. On one side he could see their city, still covered with a light morning fog. On the other side of the valley the huge white peaks didn’t seem that high anymore now that he was up high as well, but the dark clouds behind them seemed to rush over to the valley even faster now.</p><p>When he turned to the other side all he could see was mountains. One after the other, one bigger than the first one! It wasn’t like he would be thrilled about walking along a mountain range for days, sleeping in the dirt and most likely feeling cold all the time, but it was still a magnificent view!</p><p>Not wanting to leave right away, Taiga sat down on one of the big rocks and just enjoyed the view. The closer he looked the more he was able to spot. There were paths through the thick forest leading away from the city, but they had obviously not been used in years, as it was hard to even spot them. Then his look wandered off to a smaller mountain in between, it was somehow hard to spot with all the white peaks around. A dark fir forest grew over that mountain while the other mountains had a lot of different types of trees, some of them now also showing flowers and bright green leaves.</p><p>Then Taiga spotted something even weirder about that mountain, there was a building on it! Only a part the roof was visible between the dark trees and Taiga couldn’t spot any path leading to it. While he had said he wouldn’t be up for a hiking trip this was a complete different matter. Something made him focus on that hidden building as if it wasn’t supposed to be found. He would need to get down from this peak and climb up to that small mountain again and while it didn’t seem too much of a steep hike there was also no direct path so he would need to make it through the thick forest, which could cost him a lot of time.</p><p>For a moment he turned towards the city, but it was still so silent down there, still too early in the morning to see more than a few carriages on the streets.</p><p>“Guess the only thing that could happen is me getting soaked on the way back,” Taiga said with another look up to the sky before he tried to find the easiest way down.</p><p>On his way off the mountain he still had a small path he could follow, but as expected it lead towards the opposite direction on the bottom, away from the dark forest.</p><p>Maybe it was the missing sunlight on this side of the mountain, but suddenly Taiga felt a lot colder.</p><p>Not knowing where the easiest way up would be, he just went straight up, hoping he could make it to the peak without any big obstacles. To his luck there seemed to be nothing, but a few old trees lying in his way. Some of them looking like they had been cut down by men to make the mountain more accessible, but that had been definitely years ago.</p><p>There was something that he noticed after stopping to take a break for a moment. On his way up to the first mountain with his horse he had spotted a few deer and even on the peak he had heard and seen some birds, yet on this mountain it was silent, way too silent. Not knowing why a shiver went through his body and he had to laugh at himself when he realized the goosebumps on his arms, maybe he should have actually worn a jacket with the low morning temperatures.</p><p>The peak of the mountain came into sight sooner than he had expected and then he also finally spotted the house. “Well that's what I call taste,” Taiga said, but the irony was obvious.</p><p>The building in front of him seemed as if it had been there for at least one century, maybe even longer. It didn’t look too damaged, but it also didn’t look inviting, at all. It was made out of black stones which was pretty unusual, at least if compared to all the cities Taiga had been in.</p><p>Carefully Taiga moved around the house, it was bigger than he had expected it to be. It had a pretty high roof, which was also black and the walls were high enough for two floors and around the corner was a small staircase up to a wooden double door.</p><p>The windows weren’t broken to his surprise, but a lot of weed was growing over them and they were so high up that Taiga wasn’t able to look inside anyway.</p><p>Taiga walked up the stairs as if he had been actually invited to this place before he knocked with one of the black heavy iron rings. The sound echoing through the building sounded as if it had a pretty high ceiling inside, but the house remained silent.</p><p>“Idiot,” Taiga said to himself with a chuckle. “Did you really expect someone to live here?”</p><p>No of course he hadn’t, which made him squeal even louder when something inside the house was heard. A sound like something had been tossed to the ground and Taiga jumped down the stairs. Then the house fell silent again.</p><p>The next thing to happen had him growl in annoyance, when the first rain drops hit him. “Really now?” After he complained the rain started to get even heavier in the matter of minutes until Taiga had to make a decision. Go home in the heavy rain or just try if the door of the building was actually open so he could see if the rain stopped after a while again.</p><p>With the sky getting even darker and lighting and thunder joining the heavy rain Taiga had enough and he hurried back up the stairs and pulled on the heavy wooden doors which moved with an obnoxious squeaking noise, almost sounding like someone screaming.</p><p>Taiga left the door open as he was faced with a pitch black entrance hall. While the building didn’t seem to have taken any damage from the outside it was different for the inside. But it wasn’t time itself which had brought destruction to the interior. Chairs had been ripped apart, vases and mirrors smashed to the ground. Maybe there had been thieves in here over the years, after all Taiga had definitely not been the first person to dare his way to this abandoned house.</p><p>He knew he should just wait at the door for the rain to stop yet he walked further into the entrance hall the same way he had been somehow dragged to this building in the first place he felt like he wanted to explore it more.</p><p>A heavy thunder made him jolt and he made a step back towards the door. Maybe the weather was a bad omen? Shouldn’t he have come to this place? But on the other hand the weather was at fault for him having to seek shelter.</p><p>After the thunder everything fell silent again until Taiga had the weird feeling of hearing something. The heavy rain made it hard to actually hear anything in particular and he wasn’t even sure if it was his imagination.</p><p>With the next lightning he had a better view of the room and he spotted a double staircase to a second floor and right before the room fell dark again he spotted something else, or more...like someone else?</p><p>It had been too short to be sure, he had only seen some shape that could have been some furniture or something else standing around the top of the staircase, which could easily been mistaken with a human, because of its size.</p><p>Always forgetting that thunder would follow after lightning, Taiga jolted again and made a step to the back on which he stepped on a few broken parts of the smashed mirror.</p><p>Then once more it was only the rain, or not? Again he felt like he was hearing something, but maybe he was mistaken, maybe it wasn’t actually a sound he was searching for? It was more of a feeling, something that let the hairs of his neck stand up since a few minutes ago and made his legs feel heavy. Something like a presence.</p><p>While he couldn’t see anything at all in the pitch black room he wanted to back off, to make it closer to the door, yet he felt how his legs seemed to get even heavier.</p><p>He had never been at such a place before so maybe it was natural to feel scared, especially with the weather adding an extra scare factor, but something told him that he wasn’t actually supposed to be THIS scared of an empty old building.</p><p>Just when he somehow managed to make another step backwards another lightning stroke. This time he didn’t even need to look around, this time he was left screaming when someone was standing so close to him that he could have actually touched him. But all he wanted to do was run as whoever that was, whatever that was didn’t actually look friendly. Cold, silver shining eyes had been staring at him from under a black hood and the moment the thunder hit and the room fell dark Taiga screamed again and turned, aiming for the door on shaking legs.</p><p>He slipped and fell hands first into the pieces of the mirror. A cut hand was the least he would whine about now though and all he wanted to was leave. It felt like it took him an eternity to make it to the door. His body feeling heavy, almost paralyzed as he finally got to the door. On unsteady feet he dashed out into the rain, completely forgetting about the staircase and stumbling down until he fell to his knees on the grass in front of the house.</p><p>Again he could hear it, like a voice from within. He knew that whatever was living inside that house was watching him and he didn’t dare to even turn around before he started running down the mountain through the thick forest.</p><p>This hadn’t been the adventure he had been seeking and now he would never be able to unsee. But to unsee what? What had he just seen? How could he not just say this was a human who played a pretty bad prank on him?</p><p>Whatever was living in that building was not human. So Taiga could only hope that it wouldn’t hunt him down, because he was sure he wouldn’t make it out alive!</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Feeling as if choking on a silent scream, Taiga sat up with a gasp, needing a moment to realize that he was in his room. A look to the big window showed that it was night time and he could clearly hear the sound of the continuing heavy rain.</p><p>A dream? First Taiga wanted to laugh it off, of course it must have been a dream, but that laugh died in his throat when he looked down at his hands.</p><p>Cut open and bleeding, already having turned half of his bedsheets into a mess. A look down his clothes made his breaths turn more and more erratic as he realized he was indeed in the clothes from his dream, which didn’t seem as if it had been one after all.</p><p>Without knowing what else to do he jumped up and got out of his clothes. He had even worn his boots in bed. He must have been in such a state of panic that he had just dashed back right to his room after-, right…</p><p>Remembering what he had seen another shiver went through his body and he hurried to light a lamp in his room and close the curtains, before he hurried to bandage his hand and rip the sheets of his bed to hide them in case some of the maids would come in.</p><p>Feeling way too shaken and confused about the situation Taiga got into clean clothes and made sure to hide his bruises and cuts as good as he could while walking through the house. Luckily everything seemed normal and one of the maids just handed him the medicine she got for him and asked if he was feeling better.</p><p>Another relief came when he found his mare sound and safe in the stable as he could barely remember how he had made it back in the first place.</p><p>When he got out of the stable he looked up to the mountain range, but he immediately felt like he shouldn’t look. Like he could draw that thing towards the city. Had he woken up something that should have been left alone in that building?</p><p>When he felt the same weird presence as before he almost ran back into the house, but he knew that he was alone this time. It wasn’t the same as in that house, but it felt like he could still feel its presence and it made him fear that it might also work the other way around. What if he could actually track him down?</p><p>There was no way he would be able to get any sleep and in a long time he didn’t feel like having one of his secret night walks through the city. Suddenly the night had become something extremely frightening to him.</p><p>***</p><p>It was the next evening when he realized that he hadn’t gone outside even at daytime, suddenly he felt as if he had fallen ill. Unfortunately not with a normal cold, more something heavy mentally that he had to deal with from now on, but what was he supposed to do? Going to that place ever again was out of question, not even together with his father he would go there.</p><p>Defeated by his own fear Taiga made sure that the lamp on the nightstand was lit when he was going to bed. The curtains were still shut from the evening before.</p><p>Maybe he should at least tell his father about what had happened? But would he believe him and how much scolding would he get? He took a closer look at the cut on his hand, but luckily it didn’t seem too bad, but he still needed to find an excuse for it when his parents returned the next week.</p><p>For what felt like hours he tried to think of a stupid excuse for his wound, while it was actually only a distraction from his mind drifting off to those silver shining eyes. After a lot of turning around he had finally managed to fall asleep.</p><p>But it seemed like in his sleep he was even more vulnerable, getting hunted down by the recent events. After getting chased through the whole city and seeing silver eyes everywhere Taiga woke up with a gasp.</p><p>When he had calmed down a bit he realized that he was feeling pretty cold, which was the fault of him tossing his sheets to the ground through his nightmare. Then another realization hit him when he couldn’t actually see the sheets on the ground, because the light was out!</p><p>He had made sure it was filled up so it shouldn’t be out. The only reason his oil lamp would usually turn off was when he opened the door to the balcony. That thought had him freeze in his movements right before he tried to get his sheets from the ground.</p><p>He looked over to the window and the curtains were closed, almost! There was a small gap open, which let a bit of the moonlight inside of the room. But here was the problem! He was sure that he had closed them completely and the window should be shut as well.</p><p>First Taiga thought if it was time to panic, but then he laughed it off, of course a maid had taken a look at him as he had been in bed way earlier than usual. So she had checked if the window was closed and turned the lamp off.</p><p>“I’m such a scaredy cat, seriously,” Taiga said to himself as he sat up to fetch the sheet from the ground. He sat up again ready to go back to sleep when he was sure he had mistaken waking up with just ending up in another nightmare.</p><p>There could be no silver eyes looking at him in his room if it wasn’t another nightmare, right? Taiga blinked a few times more, ready to wake up, yet nothing happened. Five seconds, ten seconds and then the figure in the dark moved, just slightly and yet it left Taiga screaming, throwing his sheets towards the dark figure before he jumped off his bed towards the other side. “No, no, no. This can’t be real, wake up! WAKE UP!” He was already clawing his fingers into his skin, but unfortunately the pain just proved that this was real.</p><p>He wanted to reach out for the lamp on his nightstand, but when he found enough courage to move again he found the silver eyes staring at him from the side of the bed, making him scream again and curl up on the ground. “GET AWAY FROM ME!”</p><p>For what felt like minutes Taiga remained on the ground, his breathing pace making him feel dizzy. After another moment in which he tried to get the shaking of his body under control he finally dared to look up to find no one standing next to the bed. Was it a dream after all? Carefully he turned towards the bed and this time he didn’t even have the energy to scream anymore when he spotted the figure next to the balcony door. What did he want? Why was he here? How did he even know where to find him?</p><p>“What do you want from me?” Taiga whimpered as he fell down on the ground resting with his back against the bed and hiding his face on his knees.</p><p>“Nothing in particular.”</p><p>The reply left him speechless, not because of what he had said, but because he had said something in the first place.</p><p>“Wait, what?” Taiga finally let out and sat up on his knees, turning carefully around to the figure standing next to the window. “You have no reason to be here?”</p><p>“Not really, but you woke me up so I was bored.”</p><p>Now Taiga was more than confused, but luckily the other one’s not existing intentions made him finally calm down a bit, but he remained cautious.</p><p>“How did you know where to find me and how did you get in here?”</p><p>“I got in through the balcony door and well your blood showed me everything about you.”</p><p>This conversation went towards a really awkward direction, but if they only kept talking then he had nothing to fear, right? “How can my blood tell you where I live? Did you follow me down the mountain?”</p><p>“I don’t need to follow you. I can track you everywhere now. Your scent is easy to track now that I know it.”</p><p>“Okay wait. I have no clue what you’re talking about.” Taiga honestly said before he finally dared to reach out for his lamp.</p><p>“I’d like to ask you to not turn that on,” the other one suddenly said and there was something in his voice that made Taiga refrain from turning the light on.</p><p>“I don’t feel comfortable in the dark,” Taiga replied on which the other one pulled the curtains open so that at least the moonlight would brighten the room up a bit.</p><p>Taiga wasn’t sure what he had expected, but it wasn’t a black haired boy his age, looking back at him with a calm expression. The only thing that made a shiver ran down his spine were the silver eyes.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“Hokuto,” the other one replied.</p><p>“Ehm, okay…” Taiga said. “And what are you?”</p><p>“I guess the same as you? Taiga, right?”</p><p>“How do you know my name?” Taiga asked now finally daring to stand up, but he could feel how his legs felt pretty heavy.</p><p>“I told you, with your blood I know everything about you. Where you live, your name, well everything.”</p><p>“Then I unfortunately have to tell you that you’re not the same as me, because I can’t do that,” Taiga said before he pointed at the other one’s face. “And I don’t have those eyes.”</p><p>“But if we are not the same what am I and what are you?”</p><p>“Well I am a human,” Taiga said, but couldn’t actually think of a reply for Hokuto. “You are, well different?”</p><p>As if he couldn’t tell the difference Hokuto looked down his own body and it could almost be called cute how he seemed so confused.</p><p>“Hokuto was it, right?” Taiga asked carefully and the other one nodded. “Hokuto, you said I woke you up, is that house your living place?”</p><p>“Yes I think so at least. I don't actually remember much.”</p><p>“What do you mean with you don’t remember? You know your name, right?”</p><p>Hokuto nodded, but he didn’t seem to have more to tell.</p><p>“So you lost your memory?”</p><p>“Partly maybe? There are things I remember and things I don’t, but since I woke up I feel indeed weird.”</p><p>“How many days have you’ve been sleeping?” Taiga asked as he crawled back on his bed, but didn’t dare to get closer to the other one.</p><p>“What date do we have?”</p><p>“Today it’s the 14th of the third month.”</p><p>“Which year?”</p><p>Was he serious? But Taiga just shook his head before he replied. “It’s 1742.”</p><p>Hokuto seemed to be lost in his thoughts for a moment  before he nodded. “Well then I have been asleep for 9245 days.”</p><p>This time Taiga just remained silent with his jaw dropping. “Excuse me, what?”</p><p>“You asked how many days I was asleep, right?”</p><p>“But, you- this…” Taiga needed a moment to even calculate before he dared to stand up this time, the closest he had dared to stand to Hokuto. “That is over twenty five years. That's like your entire life judging by your age? How can that be possible?”</p><p>“It’s easy, you lay down and you sleep I guess?”</p><p>This conversation was turning so ridiculous that by now Taiga was almost sure that someone was playing a prank on him.</p><p>“Okay, so let’s just keep going with other questions then,” Taiga said, massaging his temples, because he was getting a huge headache.</p><p>“Maybe next time,” Hokuto said as he took a look out of the window. “I’ve to leave now, but it was entertaining to talk to you. If you don’t mind I will come again and answer your questions next time?”</p><p>There was not a single good reason why Taiga was nodding, but Hokuto seemed pretty happy about it as he flashed him a smile before he opened the balcony door and vanished into the dark night without another word.</p><p>Minutes passed tormenting slow while Taiga tried to make any sense out of the situation and when he realized that it was slowly getting bright outside he gave up on going to bed again. There was no way he would be able to sleep anyway.</p><p>***</p><p>The next evening Taiga stood on his balcony until the last light of the day was finally vanishing behind the mountains. He still wasn’t sure what had actually happened over the past two days and how he was supposed to think about it.</p><p>“Hokuto,” he whispered the name of the other one, but did he want him to come back? Would he be able to actually look at him without getting scared of those silver eyes? What if he made him angry and things would get dangerous? Not that the other one gave him any reason to be scared of him in the first place, except maybe breaking into his room in the middle of the night.</p><p>Not knowing if he should even bother closing the door or the curtains Taiga kept staring outside with a lost expression before a knock on his door had him jolt.</p><p>“Young lord do you need anything?”</p><p>“No thank you, for tonight you can leave.”</p><p>Maybe he shouldn’t have said that, but it wasn’t like one of the maids wasn’t downstairs overnight time anyway. But what was he saying? Was he that afraid?</p><p>Not knowing what else to do he sat on his bed waiting, but even after hours Hokuto didn’t come, even though Taiga had left the door open, because Hokuto had proven that locked doors won’t stop him anyway. Then he realized that it had been maybe his mistake that Hokuto wouldn’t come as he realized that he had left on the lamp for the entire time.</p><p>In a hurry he turned the lamp off, leaving him with only the light from outside, but unfortunately the moon wasn’t out and it was way darker than the night before.</p><p>It was when he felt like light was disturbing him that he realized that he had fallen asleep and it had become morning without Hokuto showing up or had he been there, but didn’t wake Taiga up?</p><p>The weirdest part was that he felt kind of disappointed about it? And to make it all worse Hokuto didn’t show up for the next three days either. At that point Taiga’s disappointment had changed into anger.</p><p>He had been so angry that he had actually taken his horse up the mountain once more to get to Hokuto’s house, because why would he still be afraid of going?</p><p>And it was also his last chance of going before his father would come back the next day, so he could at least ask Hokuto why he wasn’t actually coming back, while he had said he would.</p><p>The weather made it even easier to make it to Hokuto’s house, but to his surprise it was as pitch black inside as before. The windows were so overgrown with plants that they didn’t let any sunlight inside, so Taiga left the door open again as he walked in. But then he stopped in the middle of the entrance hall.</p><p>After everything that had happened he had forgotten about the chaos inside the house and suddenly he felt a bit insecure. Shouldn’t he have come? Maybe Hokuto didn’t want anyone to see this in the first place? After all Taiga knew nothing about the other one, so this was maybe a really bad idea. When he realized that he walked into a stranger’s house without asking he stepped back, not that he had bothered the first time, neither had Hokuto bothered at his place.</p><p>“Hokuto? Are you home?”</p><p>No reply, the same as the first time he had come here, but Hokuto had been home then as well, right? He had said he was asleep, so maybe he had to be louder?</p><p>Once more he dared to get inside the house a bit further and he called out for Hokuto a few more times, but again no reply.</p><p>"I shouldn't do this," Taiga said to himself, yet he made his first steps up the stairs. A long corridor awaited him and the same as the entrance hall there was destruction all over the place. Furniture in several rooms had been turned upside down, doors were half hanging from the doorframes. Carefully Taiga looked inside the first room to his left, but he could barely see anything as the room had no window at all.</p><p>"How is anyone able to live here?" Taiga asked as he looked through the room, but couldn't find candles or lambs. Thinking about it he hadn't seen any candle holders in any part of the house yet.</p><p>With a weird feeling Taiga stepped back inside the corridor and looked through a few more rooms, but to his surprise they were all similar, except for one which was on the right end of the corridor and it was a huge library. There was another huge window in this room as in the entrance hall, but again plants had taken almost all chances of the light making it through, yet at least a bit light was making it in as it was a sunny day.</p><p>Taiga randomly looked through the big room, the shelves so high that he couldn't reach the highest one without a ladder. A big red armchair was standing next to a table where he found a book pile and one book that lay open. He lifted it up and turned it around to look at the cover.</p><p>"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World," Taiga read the cover. A book he had actually read himself when he was younger. But there seemed to be way older books in here as well. Books he had never seen in their town's library and that one was of course a lot bigger. Curiously he picked another book up and started reading on a random page.</p><p>Absentmindedly he walked through the room while reading until a sudden shiver made him remember where he was in the first place and he shook his head at himself before he closed the book and looked up.</p><p>With a yelp he stumbled back, falling over to the back and cursing on the way he had hit the back of his head on a shelf.</p><p>"Why did you fall?"</p><p>"Why did I fall? Come on, it's not every day that silver eyes randomly stare back at me from the dark," Taiga complained as he got back up, but then he halted. What was he doing? This was Hokuto's place. Furthermore he didn't even know the other one that well yet, what if he already angered him?</p><p>Taiga turned back to Hokuto who hadn't moved away from the dark corridor, before he bowed. "I'm sorry for intruding on your house without asking. I'll leave if you want me to."</p><p>"I don't mind," Hokuto said neutral. "I like that book. I read a lot after you woke me up."</p><p>That statement made Taiga remember his original purpose of coming here and he hurried to put the book back on the table, yet Hokuto still didn't follow him so Taiga walked back to the door.</p><p>"Why didn't you come back?" Taiga asked, trying not to sound offended.</p><p>"I didn't want to bother you that soon," Hokuto replied to his surprise.</p><p>"Soon? It's been days."</p><p>"I thought about waiting a few months."</p><p>Now he had left Taiga dumbfounded. Was the boy for real? Had he some trouble with time management, because he also had said a ridiculous number for the days he had been asleep.</p><p>"Okay… But my father is coming back tomorrow and you can't come when he is there."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because- well, strangers are not allowed in our house."</p><p>"But I'm no stranger anymore, you know my name," Hokuto said, this time flashing a small smile and somehow Taiga couldn't take his eyes off him until Hokuto tilted his head with a questioning look.</p><p>"My father is really overprotective. A name won't do it and to be honest I doubt he'll be okay with you coming at night so you would need to come at daytime and introduce yourself."</p><p>"Oh, that's a shame," Hokuto said and suddenly walked away from the room, Taiga first looking after him in confusion before he walked after him.</p><p>"Are you busy at daytime?"</p><p>"I sleep at daytime," Hokuto replied. "You woke me up again."</p><p>"Sorry," Taiga replied. Of course he should have thought of that, not that it made sense to him why he slept at daytime and especially in such a destroyed house.</p><p>Hokuto entered a room at the end of the corridor on the left. It was the same as the others and had nothing more than a bed, a wooden desk and chair in it. When Hokuto sat down on the bed, Taiga suddenly felt kind of awkward.</p><p>"Well, I guess I should be going."</p><p>"Sure," Hokuto said as if he didn't mind at all, but that reaction had Taiga stop once more.</p><p>"So that's it?"</p><p>"What?" Hokuto asked as he was about to just lie down again, but waited on Taiga's words.</p><p>"You came to my place without any further information and now we're not going to meet again?"</p><p>"You're welcome here if your father doesn't want me to come, but I'd prefer if you come at dusk."</p><p>First Taiga wanted to complain, but what other solution could he offer?</p><p>"I can't promise that I can come. My household is really strict," Taiga replied, but Hokuto didn't seem bothered by that.</p><p>"Come when you can make it. And if I'm welcome when your father is not home I can come and visit as well."</p><p>Taiga nodded slowly while Hokuto lay on the bed, telling him with that move that their conversation was obviously over.</p><p>"Then I'm looking forward to our next conversation, I guess…" Taiga whispered more to himself as he stepped out of the room, but there was no door left to close and with slow steps he moved down the corridor. Just after he had closed the double doors of the entrance he released a long breath as if he had held it the entire time.</p><p>"What the hell was this conversation?" He asked himself and tilted his head. After he had been so afraid of Hokuto at first he was not completely confused by him. Maybe his eyes were just something genetic and because he didn't seem to have any kind of job he just liked to sleep during daytime? But there was so much more to this, so many questions. Yet Taiga shook his head and started walking. He didn't want to give himself a headache with all the unsolved mysteries around Hokuto. Maybe if they finally had a real talk, things would finally make more sense.</p><p>But for now all of that had to wait and he needed to make sure his father wouldn't find out about it.</p>

  <p>"So you fell of your horse I've heard?"</p><p>His father's question fell on deaf ears for a moment until Taiga's mother let out an unpleased sound and Taiga's eyes immediately shot up from the dinner plate.</p><p>"Yes-, well, she spooked and I unfortunately hit some branches with my hands when I tried to land safely," Taiga explained after he had told the maids the same lie about his hands.</p><p>"Maybe we should get you a new horse-"</p><p>"No," Taiga interrupted his mother immediately. His horse was fearless and would usually never spook even at the loudest sounds. But then he wondered if she would spook if Hokuto was appearing in front of her.</p><p>"You're spacing out again," his father voiced out next and he gave his son a scanning look while the maids cleaned the dinner table. "Did anything happen?"</p><p>"Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for my fall of course."</p><p>"Okay. Then let's move to another topic. Taiga, we need to talk to you about something important."</p><p>That already didn't sound like a conversation he wanted to have and the kind of proud yet sheepish smile his mother showed, already told him what topic it would be.</p><p>"On our last trip we met some really impressive families. A lot of them are involved in international trading and politics," his father explained in excitement and Taiga tried his best to fake some excitement as well.</p><p>"We are going to meet some of them again next month at the ball at the major’s house," his mother added.</p><p>"And you want me to go there," Taiga concluded, both his parents exchanging a small smile. With a sigh Taiga fell back against the backrest. "And let me guess at least one of the families has a daughter my age."</p><p>"Always a step ahead, aren't you," his mother said, kind of proud. "They are beautiful, both of them.”</p><p>"I think the daughter of the trading family will be of your liking," his father added with an approving nod. "She's quite adventures for a girl and -"</p><p>"I want to introduce you to someone."</p><p>Taiga's words hung in the room for a while until he realized what he had said.</p><p>"Oh, who is she?"</p><p>Of course his mother would immediately guess that he was talking about a girl, but that wasn't even the point. Why had he said that in the first place? There was no way his parents wouldn't declare him crazy and Hokuto as some kind of weirdo if he actually introduced him to his parents. Furthermore they had barely met two times, well three if he counted the time he ran away screaming from Hokuto.</p><p>"It's-, …not a she."</p><p>And again he said something stupid. Why couldn't he just lie? He just did great in lying a few minutes ago.</p><p>"Oh? So you made a new friend? Is he from our city?"</p><p>Taiga relaxed a bit on his father's calm words and luckily his mother also didn't seem to see it necessary to get back to the marriage topic immediately.</p><p>"More or less. He lives close by, but not directly in the city. That's why he can't come by all the time," Taiga explained.</p><p>"Then I hope he can visit soon, we'd be pleased to meet him. After all, it's great news that you made a new friend," his father said.</p><p>A friend, right. Was Hokuto a friend? He wasn't even an acquaintance yet as Taiga knew nothing but his name so far.</p><p>"I can't wait to introduce him to you," Taiga said and wondered why his improvised lie made him smile.</p><p>***</p><p>"Young lord, I'm sorry to interrupt your studies, but the library is closing for today."</p><p>Taiga looked up from the book he was intensely reading for who knew how long. But one look out of the window showed him that it had been too long. Night had already fallen over the city and he was sure that the librarian had already extended the opening hours for him as he had missed to leave on time.</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, I'll make sure to leave immediately," Taiga replied before he closed the book and wanted to put it back into the shelf.</p><p>"If you want to take it home with you then please feel free to do so," the elderly man told him, but Taiga shook his head.</p><p>"I like reading here. I'll come back for it."</p><p>It wasn't a lie, yet the only reason he had already been reading in the city's library for three days straight was to stay away from his parents' continuing marriage talks. He had of course agreed to join the ball, what else was he supposed to answer anyway?</p><p>Yet he had made them believe that for educational purposes he wanted to study more about trading and politics before it. And of course his parents had been more than happy about his idea. In the end he had ended up reading other books. The one he had found today was about the adventures of a man called Robinson Crusoe and Taiga felt kind of jealous while he of course didn't want to be thrown into the same dangerous adventure of survival, the freedom he could feel from the story made him feel even more like a prisoner in his own family.</p><p>At nighttime it was getting colder so Taiga threw his long coat over his white blouse. He hated most of his clothes. All of them were uncomfortable and showing off their noblemen status. So he usually tried to keep it at simple white clothes, black boots and the darkest coat he had when he walked around the city. Without any delay he walked up towards the long main street from where their house was already visible on the small hill before the mountain range.</p><p>When he looked around he could see families preparing their houses for the night. Mother's lighting candles, men closing the heavy wooden windows. It all looked so simple, no maids, no high class interior or fancy entrance halls. The simple things always made Taiga jealous, yet he knew that everyone would laugh at him if he voiced those thoughts out, so he never did.</p><p>There was a tavern on his way as well and he could hear people cheering and shouting from far away already and he dared to take a peek inside the lively place.</p><p>"Hey handsome, want to come in?" He was greeted at the entrance by a lady who was dressed in a way, which would make his mother freak on the spot that was for sure.</p><p>"Maybe some other time," Taiga politely declined, yet the woman took him by the arm and pulled him a bit more inside the tavern.</p><p>"Oh come on, just one drink. Or are we still too young for drinks?" The woman asked teasingly and while Taiga wasn’t that young and also had his good share of drinks at some of his father’s meetings and balls, he was a bit hesitant as it was already late and his mother would definitely scold him if he came home drunk, yet exactly that though made him change his mind and follow inside. He was tired of playing by everyone’s rules.</p><p>"Wait here, the first drink goes on the house," the woman said with a wink and vanished to the counter.</p><p>"Hey young noblemen, how about you pay a round for all of us?" A man on another table shouted, but he didn't sound offensive or threatening, just quite drunk.</p><p>"How about I do so if you win a challenge against me?" Taiga offered and the excitement about daring to talk to a stranger in the first place made him fear that he'd go against all rules his father had ever put up. But recently he had somehow started rebelling without realizing what the trigger was.</p><p>"Interesting. Then what is the challenge?" The man asked and sat down at Taiga's table when the woman brought Taiga his first drink.</p><p>"A drinking game," Taiga challenged. "And a rhythm game at the same time."</p><p>"So the loser pays for all the drinks we used for the game?" The man asked.</p><p>"And a full round for everyone present," Taiga added, making the room cheer.</p><p>"I'm in," the man said with a big laugh and Taiga gave him a challenging smile.</p><p>"Then let's see if you have any rhythm."</p><p>***</p><p>The man had actually done quite a good job at the game, but Taiga had won in the end and didn't need to spend any money. Three things had happened though. First he had ended up drunk and now he cursed himself for that, because he wasn't sure if he could hide it when he made it home. Second, it had become extremely late and he would definitely get scolded and third he had gotten so excited in his own game that he had ended up shattering a glass and cutting his hand, again…</p><p>Nevertheless he carried a light smile as he left the busy part of the city behind him. His parents would be so disappointed in him and somehow he suddenly wanted them to see him this way. Their oh so perfect son, not being that perfect anymore.</p><p>For a moment Taiga stopped as he looked ahead towards his house, the lights still on in some rooms. What would happen if he just didn't go back home? Just the thought of it and the actual thrill he felt through his own idea made him land a tiny bit back in reality and he shook his head.</p><p>"Others would give everything to have your status and yet you behave like this," Taiga scolded himself before he looked up into the night sky and took a deep breath, closing his eyes.</p><p>When he felt ready to finally make it home he lowered his head again, yet when he opened his eyes, the view to his house was blocked. Right in front of him and he wondered why he hadn't jumped and squealed this time? All he did was blink a few times before he formed a playful smile and threw his arms around Hokuto who had once more appeared way too suddenly.</p><p>"There you are," Taiga chirped. Hokuto didn't reply, but he also didn't complain when the other one hugged him. Yet he still looked a bit confused when the other one pulled back with his playful behavior.</p><p>"What are you doing here so late?" Taiga asked as if he had just met an old friend in town after a while and forgot that Hokuto usually seemed to wander around at night.</p><p>"I came to look for you," Hokuto said and first Taiga felt extremely grateful, but then Hokuto looked down at his hand.</p><p>"Wait, is this again about my blood? Come on, as if you could have known that I cut my hand."</p><p>"I didn't know," Hokuto let out. "At least not where you got hurt."</p><p>Taiga snorted on Hokuto's words, but he was still happy to see the other one.</p><p>"But today your blood smells a bit off," Hokuto explained and tilted his head. "As seem you."</p><p>This time Taiga burst out laughing and threw his arm around Hokuto's shoulder as he wanted to walk back with him towards the tavern, because why not, right?</p><p>"Oh come on as if you've never been drunk? Let's hang out now that you're here."</p><p>First Hokuto didn't seem to mind, but when they walked closed to the still lively part of the city, Taiga suddenly stopped.</p><p>"You know what, never mind. Come with me," Taiga said and took the other one by the wrist, pulling him away from the main street.</p><p>His carefree state had almost made him do something extremely dumb. First of all Hokuto didn't like light so the bright shops and taverns weren't a place he'd appreciate. The main problem was still Hokuto's eyes. Taiga had become used to them, but how would the people of his city react? He didn't want to find out.</p><p>"Let's hang out here," Taiga said as he released Hokuto and showed him the river flowing at the side of their city. There were no lights around here, but with the moonlight they could still see enough. Taiga sat down on the grass next to the river and that was when he realized how dizzy he actually felt. With a sigh he dropped to the back and closed his eyes for a moment. When he almost fell asleep he fought himself back up. Now Hokuto was sitting next to him, looking ahead at the river with an absentminded look.</p><p>"Sorry for dragging you along," Taiga finally said, but Hokuto didn't seem to mind. But that was also the problem. He didn't seem to mind anything or enjoy anything in the first place.</p><p>"Why are you living up there all alone?" Taiga asked and now he was thankful for being drunk, because he knew that he'd usually never ask so straight forward.</p><p>"It's a place where I feel safe," Hokuto replied.</p><p>"So it's your home?"</p><p>"I guess so?"</p><p>Taiga fell silent for a moment and tried to remember everything he had been told. "You said you slept for a long time. You don't know if your house is really your home. Hokuto, could it be that you lost your memory in some happening at that house?"</p><p>It made sense, didn't it? The house had been turned upside down and no one else was there while Hokuto seemed extremely confused about himself.</p><p>"Could be."</p><p>"Don't you want to find out?"</p><p>"How?" Hokuto asked and turned to the other one and for once Taiga saw a tiny bit of emotion as if Hokuto had actually hoped for someone to help him find out.</p><p>Taiga thought about it for a moment and then he formed a bright smile. "I've an idea. Meet me here tomorrow evening at the same time?"</p><p>"Sure," Hokuto let out casually and now Taiga suddenly felt like he had found a really good reason to keep up his noblemen behavior in front of his parents as good as possible.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga had waited a bit longer before going home. He had tried to be as sober as possible and luckily the lie he had come up with had been perfectly working out. He had pretended that he had been in the library for so long that he had fallen asleep and accidentally thrown the gas lamp off the table when he woke up and realized that his parents would worry for him.</p><p>Instead of scolding him, they were proud of the energy he was putting in and as the highest noblemen in town his father was allowed to get access to all buildings at all hours. So for the next evening Taiga had gotten the keys for the library so that the librarian wouldn't need to stay with him and that was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>"This one is way bigger than the one at my place," Hokuto said as Taiga had brought him towards their huge city library, but he had of course made sure to turn off the main lights. He only had one small gas lamp as Hokuto was okay with that. "But how can this place help us?"</p><p>"Follow me," Taiga said and made it through some of the long shelf rows towards the back of the room. Then he stopped in front of a shelf where a lot of older books and also rolls were placed.</p><p>"This section is about the history of this area. So I thought maybe we can find out something about the past happenings here?"</p><p>"Worth a try I guess?" Hokuto said.</p><p>"Can you read in the dark?" Taiga asked as he put the gas lamp on the side of the table, a bit away from Hokuto.</p><p>"You can't?" Hokuto asked and the confusion on his face made Taiga smile.</p><p>"I prefer my small light, but feel free to read wherever you want."</p><p>Taiga took out a few books from the shelf and went back to the table. To his surprise Hokuto also took a few and sat on the opposite side of the table.</p><p>It was the first time Taiga could get a closer look at the other one. Black wavy hair, pale skin, strong cheekbones. The silver eyes didn't seem that threatening to him in the light anymore. The boy himself didn't seem at all threatening since their second encounter and Taiga hoped that they could actually find out what had happened, because he really wanted to know more about Hokuto.</p><p>***</p><p>All of Taiga's efforts had been good for nothing the next evening though when his father had invited guests without telling him and so he hadn't been allowed to leave for the library and it would be suspicious if he begged too much, because he was officially just studying on his own.</p><p>He tried his best to not keep looking at the huge wooden clock in their living room, but the noise the pendulum made didn't help him calm down.</p><p>Hours after he had been supposed to meet with Hokuto he finally was able to retreat to his room after their guests had left. In panic he walked up and down the room. What if Hokuto was angry? What if he wasn't going to come anymore?</p><p>For a moment he thought about getting out of the window to make it over to the library, but it was already hours too late, would Hokuto really still be waiting? Yet Taiga didn't know how else he could contact him.</p><p>"Contacting him, right…" Taiga let out, realizing that there was indeed a chance to call Hokuto over. Now that the house had fallen silent he could risk it. He ran for his desk and got the paper knife out before he opened the door to the blacony. First he put the blade on his hand, but then he looked down at the still fresh bandage and realized that his hands had taken too much damage already and he got tired of explaining why. So he moved up his shirt and didn't hesitate to open a cut on the side of his hip.</p><p>For minutes he kept staring into the night, waiting for any kind of movement. Yet he couldn't spot anything.</p><p>"Would have been too easy," Taiga let out in disappointment.</p><p>"What would have been?"</p><p>This time Taiga jolted on the voice and when he swirled around Hokuto was standing right behind him with a calm expression. Taiga punched the other one on the chest, making Hokuto tilt his head in confusion.</p><p>"Dude, can you stop this?"</p><p>"Stopping what?"</p><p>"Sneaking up on me."</p><p>"But I wasn't," Hokuto replied and Taiga flicked his tongue, yet he needed to watch out that they weren't too loud.</p><p>"Whatsoever, let's get inside."</p><p>Hokuto followed and Taiga left the curtains open so that he didn't have to lid a lamp and when he sat on his bed, Hokuto remained at the door, but Taiga pointed at the bed.</p><p>"Won't you sit down?"</p><p>On the question, Hokuto did sit down, but Taiga felt like the boy behaved more like a nobleman than he did himself.</p><p>"Come on, relax," Taiga said and hit the other one on the shoulder, pointing at his legs as he was sitting way too stiff.</p><p>Hokuto got the hint and crawled more on the bed, sitting cross legged.</p><p>"Are you angry?" Taiga finally dared to ask.</p><p>"Why would I?"</p><p>"Because I didn't come."</p><p>"I knew you were busy at home," Hokuto replied and it didn't seem at all like he was angry.</p><p>As so often when Hokuto said something Taiga couldn't make sense of he just shook it off and nodded, but he didn't want the same to happen again.</p><p>"So, you came tonight because you smelled my blood, right?" Taiga asked, still wondering about that, but who was he to question someone with silver eyes. Hokuto only nodded and that made Taiga come up with an idea.</p><p>"We still have lots of books to go through so the next time I'll go to the library I'll let you know with my blood, okay?"</p><p>"Sure, that works for me," Hokuto said and wanted to get up.</p><p>"You don't have to leave. It's still not getting bright outside."</p><p>Taiga was almost laughing at his own words. He had adapted to the boy's behavior so easily.</p><p>"But don't you need to sleep?"</p><p>It was the one moment in which Taiga thought that Hokuto was way too cute for his scary appearance when he realized that he was missing the point.</p><p>"I can stay up a bit longer if you don't need to leave?"</p><p>"I can stay until the morning," Hokuto let out and Taiga moved closer in excitement.</p><p>"Oh wait, my dad bought me new books, shall we look through them? They are no history books, but as I know my father they might be similar to the ones you were reading at your place."</p><p>Hokuto nodded while Taiga got the bag with the unopened books his father had gotten as presents for him. Not that his father had handpicked them. All he did was asking at the bookstore in one of the huge cities he traveled to, to pack some recommendations for his son.</p><p>Just the excitement about being able to spend some time with Hokuto even with his parents present gave Taiga that excited feeling again. Breaking the rules had become his most dangerous hobby and he could only hope that it won't backfire.</p><p>***</p><p>Taiga woke up through a knock on his door and a maid entered seconds later. First Taiga just rolled around in his bed, obviously not getting enough sleep, but when his hand landed on a pile of books his eyes widened and he shot up.</p><p>"Everything okay young lord?" The maid asked as she opened the curtains and bright daylight filled the room. First Taiga looked around the room, but as expected Hokuto wasn't there anymore. At some point Taiga had fallen asleep so the other one must have left.</p><p>"Everything is alright," Taiga said and the maid left again after telling him to get ready for breakfast as his parents were waiting for him.</p><p>Taiga grabbed a few of the books which had fallen off the bed and while putting them back on the shelf he had to smile at some of them.</p><p>Hokuto had started reading some of them in random order on random pages and he kept asking Taiga about the storylines. He had done the same about their history books in the library and Taiga wondered if they would be able to do something about Hokuto's lost memory.</p><p>When Taiga wanted to get ready he spotted a book that had most likely ended up under the bed when they had gone through the books to decide what to read. Taiga looked at the title, but it was a word he had never seen before. Randomly he opened a page and started reading.</p><p>Another knock on his door made him snap out of it and he realized that he had ended up reading for several minutes as he had found a book that weirdly resembled reality more than it should, after all this was fiction, right?</p><p>For now Taiga put it back on the shelf and hurried to get dressed, but he would definitely get back to that book in the evening.</p>
