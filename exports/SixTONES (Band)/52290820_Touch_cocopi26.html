<div class="userstuff">
<p>They walk away from the room after thanking everyone including the staff and leave them. There is no schedule as a group after their YouTube filming so everyone has their own plans. Shintaro and Juri will have another YouTube filming for their game channels. Meanwhile Kochi will have a quick dinner with Jesse before he goes to film his unannounced drama. Hokuto walks after them alone, ears listening to the conversation and some jokes that Jesse throws among them while occasionally replying back a joke to Jesse. Hokuto is getting carried away by the warm and comfy atmosphere around them but then a voice vibrates through his ear, making him startle.</p><p> </p><p>“Was it hurt?”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turns his face and meets Taiga’s figure walking beside him. He doesn't realize that Taiga is there, matching his step with his. Before he finds a chance to answer him, some staff walk after them while bringing some big stuff in a trolley. The staff probably don't see them as they nearly hit Taiga if he doesn't move closer to Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>Their arms slightly bump and Hokuto, who was laughing freely, his body suddenly tensed as he feels Taiga’s warm arms over his own. He hears the staff apologizing before they walk away, leaving them alone in the hallway. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” Taiga asks, looking concerned at him while touching his arm.</p><p> </p><p>“It's okay, it's fine.” Hokuto replies while smiling politely. Taiga nods. But then he rubs Hokuto’s arms as if he cleans the dust over it. Taiga probably feels guilty because he bumped into him, at least that's what Hokuto thinks so he lets him do that even though Hokuto is completely wrapped by awkwardness within him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s rub felt like usual until Hokuto noticed his touch starting to soften on his arm.</p><p> </p><p>“How about that?” he asks gently. Hokuto is completely surprised and confused at the same time, and his reflexes stir him to throw his head towards Taiga and meet his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The world seems to have stopped. Hokuto doesn't even realize that he has been holding his breath as he locks his eyes with Taiga's, as if he's getting dragged into Taiga's world. Hokuto accidentally let his eyes wander around Taiga's figure, satisfying himself by gazing at Taiga's tanned skin that glows under the room lights. Hokuto always thinks Taiga is hot, but this time, he finds Taiga looks sexier.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's long wavy black hair only made him look prettier but his tanned skin. Taiga's tanned skin is something different. If Hokuto loves to see Taiga's long hair, he loves Taiga's tanned skin even more. It was rare to see him tanned. Even Taiga himself wanted to be tanned but it was difficult for him. Hokuto finds it cute at first but after he sees how dark Taiga's skin is for the first time, which is this afternoon when they gathered for filming their YouTube. It feels different.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga is already hot and sexy in his own way. He has a pretty face but he is so manly. Hokuto always admires how cool Taiga could be. The way he sings. The way he plays his guitar. The way he dances. Everything about Taiga was always captivating. And now he has tanned skin. How perfect he wants to be, Hokuto thinks. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto is completely dragged into Taiga's eyes, as if he's standing on the doorway of his world and he doesn't know how to step back. He doesn't even realize how close their faces are if Taiga doesn't speak softly in front of his face, making him feel Taiga's warm breath over his cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Does it still hurt?" Taiga asks half whispers. Hokuto's lips are slightly parted as he watches Taiga moving closer and closer. His heart starts beating faster and his cheeks blooming in pink. Hokuto takes a gulp and darts his eyes into Taiga's. But instead of answering, Hokuto says, “are you flirting with me?”</p><p> </p><p>A thin smirk etches on Taiga's lips. His lashes move beautifully as he blinks slowly, making Hokuto’s heart flutter. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just asking about your condition. Why do you think I'm flirting with you?" He says in a lower tone.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto takes another gulp as he averts his eyes on Taiga's lips. He knows he isn't supposed to be like this, but he can't hold himself anymore. God knows how hard Hokuto has been holding himself. </p><p> </p><p>“It does…” he replies. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiles. But Hokuto knows Taiga will throw another tease again to him. Taiga's lips are slightly parted as if he's being hesitant to ask.</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I want to check something, if you don't mind.” Taiga says while tilting his head. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto doesn't think he's ready for this.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smirks, “do you mind?” as he moves his hand slowly, tracing his palm over Hokuto’s belly before he lands it over his trousers. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s breath hitches as he feels Taiga’s hand on his, palming his shaft behind its cloth while smirking. He grips Taiga's wrist while locking his eyes on his.</p><p> </p><p>“Taiga…” Hokuto asks softly, begging him not to touch him. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you mind?" Taiga asks, not letting Hokuto speak even more. </p><p> </p><p>Of course Hokuto doesn't. He <em> doesn't </em> mind at all. He has been holding it since they met for filming their youtube video this afternoon. Seeing Taiga came with his usual clothes, black t-shirt and training trousers. But then, his long wavy black hair and tanned skin hit Hokuto’s hard. It was really difficult for him not to steal a glance at Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>Many things happened when they were filming for their YouTube video, but this time was something he never expected. They laughed a lot and Hokuto was completely absorbed into the fun atmosphere among them. So when Juri asked Taiga to try what Jesse and Kochi did earlier, Hokuto didn't have any problem. He wasn't aware at all. He thought Taiga wouldn't even have the strength to carry him but Hokuto was completely wrong. The moment when Taiga looped his arms around his waist, Hokuto’s heart skipped a bit. But he managed to act normal by smiling happily. </p><p> </p><p>But the next step that Taiga did to him was something he never expected. He didn't expect that Taiga would touch a part of him. Hurting him accidentally but at the same time, it turned him even more. It was so difficult to gain his focus after that. That was the reason he was struggling to speak English as Jesse did. The words were scattered on his brain, unable to think clearly and his tongue refused to spit it out. He had fun. He was having a lot of fun with his members while playing the game. But his body couldn't forget the tight arms that hooked his lower body. It hurt, but for some reason that Hokuto didn't realize yet, he wanted it again.</p><p> </p><p>And he doesn't mind if Taiga wants to check it.</p><p> </p><p>But can't he <em> at least </em> move to a safer place? He knows they are standing beside bushes in the indoor garden, but still. Does Taiga really want to <em> do </em> that? </p><p> </p><p>“I won't do anything, I just need to check something.” Taiga speaks gently as if he can read Hokuto’s mind. He moves closer to Hokuto’s lips, making the younger one freeze.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto holds his breath as Taiga slips his palm through his trousers, stroking his belly gently before he stops his palm over his shaft. Hokuto can feel how cold Taiga's hand is even though he doesn't touch him directly.</p><p> </p><p>“Aah, as expected,” he says while smirking.</p><p> </p><p>“Is it because of my touch earlier or you're already hardened before that?” Taiga asks again. Hokuto can't hide his flushed cheeks as Taiga leans closer to him, smiling beautifully but clearly teasing him.</p><p> </p><p>“Shall I help you?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Goddammit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto doesn't know how to refuse or his brain is too foggy to think. His blood starts rushing in his veins as Taiga grabs his shaft gently, caressing its tip with his thumb while smiling softly.</p><p> </p><p>“See? You need some help.” Taiga whispers as he nuzzles his nose onto Hokuto’s sharp jaw, sending shivers down Hokuto’s spine. His breath catches as Taiga squeezes him gently, making him throw his head backwards and <em> unintentionally </em> giving Taiga more space to nuzzle his neck. </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, I'm sorry I didn't mean to." Taiga says before a chuckle escapes from his lips. Hokuto’s brow slightly furrows as he brings back his head and locks his eyes on Taiga's.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga really knows how to tease him.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn't like how good Taiga teases him. It doesn't mean he hates him. He just doesn't know how to control himself whenever Taiga teases him. He was utterly fluttering when Taiga gave a sudden back hug and carried him earlier. He was uncontrollably blushing when they laughed at him after he told them that it was a bit painful.</p><p> </p><p>And now Taiga just added more pain around him.</p><p> </p><p>It's painful, but Hokuto likes it. He can't lie, he really likes the way Taiga touches him. Grabbing him gently while whispering inaudible words as Hokuto’s head starts to spin. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto chokes back his moan as Taiga tightens his grip around his boxer, palming his rooster and moving it up and down slowly, sending more shivers down his veins. Hokuto moves his hand fastly to grab Taiga's wrist and stops him before he goes crazier.</p><p> </p><p>“Someone will come."</p><p> </p><p>“You mean, you will <em> come </em>?" Taiga chuckles while smirking. His eyes lit a fire inside Hokuto and it just turned him even more. Hokuto swallows hard as he tries to bring his focus. They need to stop.</p><p> </p><p>“What if someone sees us?" He tries to convince Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>“Then we need to be quick.” Taiga whispers in front of his lips. He looks around and sees the clock hanging on the wall. A widener smirk etches on his lips as he says, “I think everyone is going back already, Hokuto.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Goddammit</em>. Hokuto has been used to being called by his first name even from Taiga. But this is the first time Taiga whispers his name so close to him. So close that Hokuto can feel Taiga's warm breath on his lips. Their lips are parted and inches to crash but Taiga doesn't attack him. He keeps their distance to stay that close while brushing his nose around Hokuto’s blushed cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>The younger can't hold back himself as Taiga leans his forehead on his own, breathing softly in front of his lips while keeping his cold palm on his shaft. Even without moving it, Taiga can make him hardened. Hokuto can feel his cock twitching in Taiga's grip, making him blushed even more.</p><p> </p><p>He wants to run away but his body freezes as Taiga smiles in front of his lips. </p><p> </p><p>“Just let me help you, Hokuto.” Taiga whispers. He nuzzles his nose on Hokuto’s as he starts moving his palm up and down, pleasing the younger and making him comfortable by his touch. Hokuto’s lips slightly open as Taiga parted their touched foreheads. Inaudible moans and heavy breath escapes from his lips as Taiga squeezes his cock and caresses its tip by his fingertip.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Dammit, Taiga. You are even so good at touching.” </em> Hokuto really wants to spill it but he chokes back his words as Taiga holds his shaft tight on his palm and then he starts moving it, making a circle with his shaft. His other hand hooks Hokuto’s back, keeping him in a close distance as if he knows that Hokuto would run away.</p><p> </p><p>But Hokuto gives up.</p><p> </p><p>His breath is heavier and his head is already spinning. Taiga's touch feels amazing and he can feel that he will reach his own peak.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto moves his grip from Taiga's wrist to Taiga's waist, then he brings his forehead to touch Taiga's while catching his own breath. A satisfied smile etches on Taiga's lips as he keeps moving his hand on Hokuto’s shaft behind its cloth.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, I have been saying I really wanted a tan skin and I managed to be tanned even though it's only for my role. But I'm happy to be tanned. What do you think, Hokuto?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga speaks in half whispers in front of Hokuto’s lips while moving his cock under his palm, keeping the rhythm steady. </p><p> </p><p>“I also grow my hair longer this time but I keep it in dark color. What do you think, Hokuto? Do you like it?" Taiga continues, still in the same tone of voice, but this time his hand moves a bit faster.</p><p> </p><p>“I know you have been stealing a glance at me. What is it, Hokuto?" Taiga asks, pulling back his forehead away from Hokuto’s and locking his eyes on him.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s lips become dry. He is not expecting that Taiga also keeps his eyes on him. He really wants to answer all of Taiga's questions but his voice is stuck, getting blocked by moans in his throat. And instead of words, only heavy sighs managed to escape from his lips. </p><p> </p><p>And he swears he not only sees temptation within Taiga's eyes, but also lust and desire. And those eyes only make him aroused even more.</p><p> </p><p>His lips are already parted, words hanging in his tongue. But seeing how Taiga's eyes sparkle only makes the fire in his body burn even more. He can feel his body heating up and sweats rolling on his back.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto can't hold himself back anymore.</p><p> </p><p>He leans closer to Taiga and grabs his chin before crashing his lips on his, smooching him deeply as if he is taking Taiga's soul.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga pulls himself back while saying, “Uhm… hmm… no kisses. I just want to play with this.” He says as he grabs Hokuto’s shaft tightly, making it twitch.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah it's getting wet." Taiga chuckles as he nuzzles his nose onto Hokuto’s chin and caresses his sharp jaw with his nose. Hokuto doesn't know how red his face is after hearing what Taiga says. He can feel he is getting close to his peak and he knows how wet his boxer already is. But Taiga's touch really drags him crazier and it makes him want even more. He wants to beg for it but before he spills his words, Taiga tightens his grip around his arousal, abusing it behind its cloth by moving his hand faster and faster.</p><p> </p><p>“Ahhhh… Taiga—.... I'm going… ahhh—.... ” Hokuto can't hold his moans. His knees are weakened and his body starts trembling. But before his moans get louder, Taiga silences him by saying, “shhhhhh, don't make any sounds or I will stop here." </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No, don't stop. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto chokes back his moans as he locks his eyes on Taiga's, obeying his order. Taiga smiles as he increases his rhythm around Hokuto’s cock, making the younger eyes widened. His pupil dilates and his trembling lips slightly open. Hokuto throws his head backwards as Taiga squeezes him hard and laughs softly, as if he is having fun torturing and teasing him. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto really <em> hates </em> how good Taiga's touch is around him. He really <em> hates </em> how Taiga can be perfect in many things. He really <em> hates </em> how handsome and cool Taiga is. He really <em> hates </em> how Taiga smiles brightly while teasing him.</p><p> </p><p>He really <em> hates </em> that he might fall in love with him.</p><p> </p><p>Nah, Hokuto <em>is</em> <em>already</em> in love with him.</p><p> </p><p>And he hates it.</p><p> </p><p>He hates it but he really loves it. He loves it so much that he hates himself because he wants more and more of Taiga's touch. He wants more and more of Taiga. He wants more. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga squeezes Hokuto’s shaft once more and tightens his grip around him, as if he knows that Hokuto will reach his peak. And he is right. Hokuto spills his own milk and wet his own boxer right after Taiga's last harder squeeze on his cock, making the older look satisfied. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto leans his head on Taiga's shoulder as he spills another liquid under him, flooding his own boxer even more. His breath is still unsteady as Taiga pulls out his hand from Hokuto's trousers.</p><p> </p><p>“How was it?” he whispers in Hokuto's ears softly. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looks up and meets Taiga's gaze beside him. How mesmerizing his eyes are. His lashes look like a butterfly as Taiga blinks slowly while waiting for his answers.</p><p> </p><p>He really wants to kiss those beautiful eyes, but Hokuto has to control himself. </p><p> </p><p>“Amazing…” is a word that managed to escape from his lips. Hokuto takes a deep breath as he moves backwards slowly, creating a distance between him and Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>He looks up and sees Taiga smiles softly towards him. A very soft and warm smile and it feels different from earlier, making his heart flutter. Hokuto looks away as he realizes that his cheeks are flushed again, trying to ignore how Taiga smells his own hands, the same hands that he used to abuse his shaft. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm, I like it." Taiga says as he smirks teasingly.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Hokuto. For letting me help you,” he continues. Hokuto looks at him and sees a glimpse of a genuine smile on Taiga's lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I'd like to help you again if you don't mind." Taiga says as their eyes meet.</p><p> </p><p>For the second time, Hokuto feels like the word seems to have stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s breath has become steady as he watches Taiga's back walk away after he throws a bright smile towards him, making him blushed even more. </p><p> </p><p>But after moving for a few steps, he stops and turns his body to face Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s brows slightly furrow as he sees what kind of face that Taiga has.</p><p> </p><p>“But next time, I want to feel it directly, without any barrier.” He says firmly, as if he is a prince that wants his order to be obeyed. But then, he smiles brightly and says, “good night, Hokuto."  </p><p> </p><p>Taiga walks away, leaving Hokuto alone with a bunch of questions in his head. His body starts heating up again as he thinks about the possibility of what Taiga wants to do next time.</p><p> </p><p><em> “I want to feel it directly, without any barrier…” </em>Hokuto repeats Taiga's words again and again in his head. His breath becomes unsteady again as he gets what Taiga means. His cheeks are flushed and his hands fly onto his face as he collapses on his knees. Wrapping himself tight and burying his face deeply.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto really <em> hates </em>how Taiga is so good at teasing him.</p><p> </p><p>“Damn you, Kyomoto Taiga."</p><p> </p>
