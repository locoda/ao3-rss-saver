</p><p> </p><p>The sound of quick tapping halted and Kochi’s fingers stopped to hover over the keyboard. “For whom?”</p><p>Leaning backwards on his chair at the other side of the breakfast table Shintaro put down his coffee mug, crossed his arms across his chest and tilted his head. “Young? Healthy?”</p><p>“Hot? Likes housework?” Jesse said, grinning as he peeked at the screen across Kochi’s shoulder.</p><p>Kochi snorted. “Don’t be ridiculous. I’d rather prioritize them being able to feed us. They don’t need to be pretty. Also, we can do our own laundry just fine for now.”</p><p>“Yeah. I did Akito’s laundry up until we moved here,” Shintaro pointed out.</p><p>“Even after he changed you?” Jesse asked, surprised. It had almost been a full year since Shintaro became a vampire, just a month longer than Jesse had been one. But Tsuyoshi-san had immediately relieved Jesse from all housework, having already made all the preparations for hiring a new familiar before proceeding to change Jesse.</p><p>“Well, yeah. Akito didn’t find another familiar before now and he couldn’t do laundry during the quiet hours. And since I still can’t sleep at daytime it felt sensible. I guess we just…stuck with it. Old habit.”</p><p>Jesse glanced at Kochi who shrugged, and Jesse didn’t need to ask about him. It was Kochi’s third week as a vampire, and the second week of the three of them living together, so he didn’t have much to say to the topic. Kamenashi-san had been pleased with Kochi, but ever since Shintaro and Jesse had started to plan for living together, Kochi had wanted to join his friends.</p><p>It had been extremely kind of Kamenashi to agree to change Kochi with such a quick schedule. Old vampires tended to take their time with important decisions that affected their daily lives, and Jesse was sure Kamenashi would rather have kept Kochi with him for another fifty years or so. After all, his former familiar had spent a full century with him, while Kochi had only stayed for about thirty years.</p><p>“Your attention, please?” Kochi reminded them both, gnawing his lower lip. “The recruitment process had better not take weeks. I’m hungry.”</p><p> </p><p>- - -</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you want to become a familiar?”</p><p>“I hear vampires don’t need to sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“Can you cook?”</p><p>“Sure, though I must say I have never tried recipes with actual blood.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“What makes you the best applicant for the job?”</p><p>“Are you seeing a queue of applicants in the lobby?”</p>
