<p>"Is everything alright?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeaah!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, you have put everything we need inside, right?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah… yeah I guess I've put them all."</p><p> </p><p>"Do we really need to go this time? Can't we just wait tomorrow?" The other boy with glasses asked his friends, making sure about their decision. </p><p> </p><p>"The sun will go down… It's going to be dark…"</p><p> </p><p>"Then we have to go back before it's dark." The boy with a black hat said convinced.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm… I'm worried about us."</p><p> </p><p>"I've told you we can't help it. If you're not sure then stay here. Don't make us stop just because you can't deal with your fear." He said again. The boy with glasses could only sigh as he mumbled something.</p><p> </p><p>"Tougo Sensei would be mad at us if he knew about it… " he took a gulp after saying that to his friends, worries clearly seen in his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"Well it's better than facing him and telling him that we forgot about our report because we're busy with the art club."</p><p> </p><p>"But, Ryo… he might kill us if he found—...."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh please Toru, we don't have time for debate. If you are worried about it, then stay. I will go with Haruto." Ryo said his last words before turning his face towards Haruto, making sure that his friend would be on his side. Haruto didn't say anything, he would go with Ryo but he could understand if Toru was afraid about it. After all, this was a crazy thing for them to go to explore the sea in twilight just because they forgot about the deadline for their report.</p><p> </p><p>Tougo Sensei asked them to make a report about the difference of sand in the sea. They could just use some journal but Ryo and his arrogance dragged him and his friends to take a sample and test it in the lab. They had to do it now because they wouldn't have time tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>Toru took a deep breath and swallowed hard his fear. He still didn't know the point of this but he didn't want to argue with Ryo. He would be in trouble. So he decided to face his fear and believe in his <em>luck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Ready?"</p><p> </p><p>Toru nodded slowly, his hands gripped the ship tightly as Haruto turned the machine on.</p><p> </p><p>Those three reckless college students went by boat out to sea. Toru kept looking at his back to see how far they've gone. He kept telling them not to go too far because it might be dangerous. Ryo told him to shut up as he kept his eyes focused on the sea. He saw some fishermen were still around and told Haruto to go further. The yellowish evening sky greeted them as they stopped the boat. Ryo took off his clothes, wearing a snorkel, and brought 3 sample vials hanging around his neck.</p><p> </p><p>"Take care, bro. You should quickly get on the boat when you're done." Haruto said as he tried to hide his worries.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm going." Ryo said before he dived.</p><p> </p><p>They were waiting for his friend in silence. Toru couldn't stop biting his lips as he tried to calm himself. It had been 10 minutes and Ryo hadn't come up yet.</p><p> </p><p>"Why's he taking so long?" Toru mumbled as he kept fidgeting with his feet. Haruto didn't say anything. </p><p> </p><p>"It's getting darker. Where's Ryo?" Toru started whining to Haruto. He couldn't hide his worries, a part of him told him to ask Haruto so they could just leave but another part of him telling him to wait, maybe Ryo would appear sooner.</p><p> </p><p>He was going to ask Haruto but he could see how pale his skin was.</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto?"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto you okay?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hey Haruto, answer me!!" Toru started shaking Haruto's shoulder as he tried to bring him back.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you hear that?" Haruto said, his voice was soft, so soft even Toru barely heard him. </p><p> </p><p>"What? What, Haruto? Hear what?"</p><p> </p><p>"There's no one here!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, what do you hear? I can't hear anything!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, tell me what do you h—...." Toru stopped his words as he started hearing a voice.</p><p> </p><p>The voice around him sounded like a choir singing but he couldn't tell the lyrics. It sounded euphonic and mesmerizing. He couldn't help but keep listening to it and hypnotized him. The wind began to shake them. The sky was totally dark, there were no stars or the moon.</p><p> </p><p>It was dark. </p><p> </p><p>"TORU!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Toru blinked and realized that he had been holding his breath, looking at Haruto in confusion. He found Haruto looking at him firmly, his face full of sweat and his arms hurt because of how tight Haruto gripped him.</p><p> </p><p> "We need to go back, now!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Toru was still confused but he nodded and moved closer to Haruto and sat in front of him. He tried to ignore the voice that kept echoing in his ears. He started to realize there was something wrong around him and he tried his best to ignore it, the mellifluous voices in the sea that kept echoing around him. He gulped as realized that nobody was around, but he could hear the voices clearly, making him goosebumps.</p><p> </p><p>"Keep looking ahead, don't listen to them." Haruto said from behind, he might try to sound tough but Toru knew his voice was shaking as he kept his eyes ahead, wishing that they could arrive sooner. </p><p> </p><p>"B-but.. ho-... how about Ryo?" Toru asked, his voice shaking. </p><p> </p><p>Haruto didn't say anything. He wished they could wait for him but he had to bring them outside.</p><p> </p><p>Toru closed his eyes tight as he heard the voice getting louder. If it was mellifluous, it became shrilly. He could hear it clearly and realized that they were singing. </p><p> </p><p>"Why are we still not there? We didn't go that far, did we?" Toru whined as he clenched his hand on his own pants. The voice was getting louder and louder and it was terrified him.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Where are you going, Toru? ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Toru… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Toru, wait for me ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Don't leave me… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Toru shut his eyes tightly as he tried hard to ignore those voices. He bit his trembling lip hard, his hands grabbed his knees as he tried to hold them from shaking.</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, can we go faster?"</p><p> </p><p>The voice sounded like it was echoing behind him. He placed his hands over his ears while shaking and kept talking to wash away the voice off his ears. </p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, please!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Can we go faster?!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto?!! Why don't you answer me?!!" </p><p> </p><p>Toru swallowed an uncomfortable feeling inside him, he lowered one of his hands and touched the wood behind him, trying to find Haruto's feet.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't know whether he moved from his seat or Haruto was the one who did it because he couldn't find anything behind him. He kept seeking anything to hold. </p><p> </p><p>His hand had reached the machine.</p><p> </p><p>But he couldn't find Haruto.</p><p> </p><p><em>Where's Haruto?</em> </p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, please, it's not funny!"</p><p> </p><p>"Give me your hand, feet, anything!! Just let me hold something now!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Toru kept his voice loud, shouting nonsense as he waited for Haruto but he got nothing. He held his breath as the voice began to faint as if carried by the wind. </p><p> </p><p>He let out his breath as he kept his eyes ahead, but his vision got blurred as tears started pooling on his eyes. He couldn't help but cry. He didn't know if he would ever make it to the shore or not, but he would keep trying and he hoped the engine would not run out of fuel. He wiped his tears and moved his body to the end of the ship. He needed the flashlight but he wasn't sure he could look back. His hand kept looking for it behind him and thankfully he got it.</p><p> </p><p>He turned it on and started crying in relief as he saw the shore in front of him. He pushed the button that he found with his thumb, hoping that it would make him go faster. And as he wished, the boat went faster.</p><p> </p><p>But he still hadn't reached the shore yet. The machine had run out of fuel, the flashlight also ran out of battery. It was cold and dark around him.</p><p> </p><p>It was so cold until he couldn't feel his feet. His breath was hitched as he heard the voice calling his name. His widened eyes wandered around him to find anything even though he knew it was useless. It was too dark.</p><p> </p><p>The voice sounded soporific. Toru could feel his body relaxed, his eyes felt heavy. No matter how hard he tried to fight back his sleepiness, he failed. He laid his back on the boat and blinked slowly as if his body moved by itself, breathing slowly as sleepy wrapped him tight.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Sleep, Toru. Sleep… and you will be okay ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Toru closed his eyes as it was told and let the boat sink into the sea.</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>Haruto did think it was a bad idea when Ryo asked him to join his <em>crazy</em> thoughts to get some sand samples in the sea for their report because of his arrogance. But he was pissed off with Tougo Sensei too, that's why he joined him to do this. He was fine at first, he had confidence that they would be fine. That's why he didn't say anything when Toru whined about it. He could see clearly how afraid Toru was. He couldn't blame him though. After all, Ryo was really crazy for dragging them to do this and he was as <em>crazy</em> as him for agreeing. But he couldn't stop his friend from doing it alone, could he? It might be the right decision to follow him.</p><p> </p><p>But Haruto changed his mind the moment when they left the shore. His heartbeat increased, sweat covered up his back as he tried to calm himself. He kept looking at his watch to make sure that he would stop the boat in five minutes. He felt a bit relieved when he saw two fishermen around them, seeming like they wouldn't leave for a while. </p><p> </p><p>As he planned, he stopped the boat after five minutes of their departure (or maybe that was he thought). He took a glance and he still could see the shore. He handed a snorkel to Ryo before all diving into the sea, telling him to be careful and not to dive too long. </p><p> </p><p>"You should quickly get on the boat when you're done." He said as he tried to hide his worries. He saw Ryo nodded before he dived.</p><p> </p><p>They had waited for Ryo to appear. 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 6 minutes…</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Why is he taking so long?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Haruto asked to himself as he clenched his hand into a fist, worries started wrapping him. He leaned over from the boat to look at Ryo under the sea, but it was too dark. He couldn't see anything. He tried to splash the water to see any sign of Ryo, but instead of him, Haruto saw something glowing, swimming so fast to their boat. His breath hitched and raised his body suddenly. He looked at Toru to check him but it seemed like Toru didn't see anything. As he wanted to call him, he heard a voice singing around him, an euphonic voice calling his name. He swallowed hard and looked around, trying to find someone who sang.</p><p> </p><p>But Haruto didn't find anything. The voice got louder and kept calling him. He wanted to ask Toru but his body couldn't move. His voice stuck on his throat. Everything he could do was just whispers. </p><p> </p><p>"Toru… "</p><p> </p><p>"Toru…!!" </p><p> </p><p>He could feel his body was getting colder. He also knew Toru was beside him, shaking his shoulder but he couldn't move his body. He tried his best to fight back, convincing himself that he could move. He had to let out his voice. He had to do this.</p><p> </p><p>"D… did you hear that?" Haruto didn't know whether Toru heard him or not. He felt like his voice was choked. </p><p> </p><p>"What? What, Haruto? Hear what?"</p><p> </p><p>"There's no one here!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, what do you hear? I can't hear anything!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Haruto, tell me wh—...."</p><p> </p><p>Haruto couldn't hear Toru's voice anymore as the song got louder, like it was echoing in his ears. He breathed deeply and slowly as he tried to move his body, clenching his hand a few times before turning towards his friend.</p><p> </p><p>He found Toru was lost in his reverie. It was dark but Haruto could see Toru looking at the sea in an empty gaze. </p><p> </p><p>"T… Toru… ?" Haruto grabbed Toru's shoulder slowly and turned his face at the sea, trying to find something that Toru had been looking at.</p><p> </p><p>It was cold but Haruto was sweaty, his eyes widened and his hands started trembling. He gulped hard before turning his face toward his friend.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered this.</p><p> </p><p>He started remembering this. The most important thing that his grandpa told him about the sea. He was a sailor for many years and he used to tell a story about it to his grandchild. Haruto thought his grandpa only made jokes for them, so he took it easy. But it seemed like his grandpa was right, and he never thought that he would experience the same situation as the story. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Never listen to any voice on the high seas. If you heard it, ignore it. Go away! Save your life!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Haruto blinked repeatedly as he let out his breath he had been holding. He tried to bring back his focus. He took a flashlight from his bag and turned it on. He moved again to Toru and shook his body. </p><p> </p><p>"Toru!! Toru!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Toru, listen to me!!!" </p><p> </p><p>"Toru, can you hear me?!" Haruto placed his hands on Toru's face and turned him facing him. </p><p> </p><p>He saw Toru's eyes were empty, yet it became softened, its pupil dilated and he was smiling. </p><p> </p><p>It was so freaking creepy, Haruto even had goosebumps. He felt like he wanted to leave him alone but he realized where they were. So he had to be brave. He gritted his teeth and shook Toru's arms harder, calling him louder to bring his friend back.</p><p> </p><p>"Toru!! Toru!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Toru, please listen to me!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"TORU!!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>He let out a sigh of relief when he saw Toru was already back, looking at him confused. He knew Toru might have a lot of things to ask but they didn't have time for that. Haruto gulped once again and tightened his grip on Toru's arms.</p><p> </p><p>"We need to go back now!!!" Because they had to, they had to run or they might die soon. Haruto lowered his hands and moved to the end of the boat, reaching for the engine and turned it on.</p><p> </p><p>He turned the boat and left the place as soon as they could. They carried a flashlight that was bright enough, they could see it clearly if it was on land or in the forest, but it didn't work here. It was too foggy around them and they barely saw anything.</p><p> </p><p>The song was getting louder and louder as if it was getting closer. Haruto tightened his grip on the hold, trying his best to ignore even though his knees were trembling. He could see Toru's back was tense, he might have heard it too.</p><p> </p><p>"Keep looking ahead, don't listen to them." He said, trying to convince himself more than Toru that he would be okay, they would be okay.</p><p> </p><p>"B-... But how about Ryo?"</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Shit! That son of bitch. We're here because of him!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I don't think he's still alive…" Haruto mumbled to himself, hoping that Toru wouldn't hear him.</p><p> </p><p>Haruto could see the shore in front of him and he sighed in relief. Just a little bit and they would arrive soon.</p><p> </p><p>But then something came again to distract them, a voice. An euphonic voice singing behind him. A very beautiful song that Haruto had ever heard, making him complacent. The surroundings became noticeably brighter, he could see the beautiful stars glimmering on it. It was beautiful. It made him happy.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Come here, Haruto ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Come to see me, I'm the most beautiful thing you would ever see… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Come to me… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Ohh come here… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Haruto wanted to see that, he wanted to see the most beautiful thing in this world, the thing that was more beautiful than the stars. He wanted it. He wanted to see it. So he dived in. He let himself swim in the cold night, leaving Toru alone on the boat.</p><p> </p><p>And he never comes back.</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>"Take care, bro. You should quickly get on the boat when you're done."</p><p> </p><p>Ryo nodded, "I'm going!" he said. He dived into the sea. He took off the vials around his neck as he reached the seabed, shoveling sand with the first vial. He swam another meter to the right and filled the second vial with new sand. For the third vial, he swam a few meters ahead because he had feelings that he might find something different. As he finished, he hung the vials around his neck again and swam to the surface to check how far he went from the boat.</p><p> </p><p>Ryo was sure he swam for around 5 meters only, he wasn't sure whether he was going too far or Haruto had moved their boat because it seemed like they were like 50 meters away from him. He was shouting their names but seemed like his voice was inaudible. The sun had really set, the cold air started hitting him. He took a deep breath and swam again to reach their boat. </p><p> </p><p>Under the water he barely saw anything. It was so dark and he started thinking that he should've bought a flashlight with him. He swam faster so that he could arrive at the boat. They were 50 meters away but they were still reachable for him. He was good at swimming and it shouldn't take so long to get there. He looked above and saw a silhouette of their boat. </p><p> </p><p>He swam to reach it, but he couldn't find it. He was sure that he swam in the right direction so why didn't he find them? Did he go too far? Did he miss it? </p><p> </p><p>"Did they leave me?"</p><p> </p><p>But he didn't see them leave. Was it the same boat that he saw under the water earlier? It was supposed to be the same, right? </p><p> </p><p>"Woah they really left me, huh?!" He was busy cursing his friends, pissed off of how they behaved at him who sacrificed himself to swim in this <em>fucking</em> cold water. Ryo had to do that because he was the one who could do this, who else could if it wasn't him? They didn't even offer themselves any help.</p><p> </p><p>"Shit!" he punched the water and cursed them again and again, "I definitely will make this report alone!" he declared. He wore the snorkel again and was going to swim, but then a voice suddenly echoed around him. The fog was coming and blocking his visions. The air became colder and colder. It was dark. He couldn't see anything.</p><p> </p><p>He heard the voice again and this time it was singing.</p><p> </p><p>"Who's that?" He looked around to find anything who teased him, becoming alert that it would attack him.</p><p> </p><p>He swam again to reach the shore even though he wasn't sure where he went because he couldn't see anything. He didn't even know the cardinal directions. His body felt tired of swimming too, but it wasn't the right time to whine about it. He had to leave this place.</p><p> </p><p>But no matter how far he went, he didn't find the end of this sea. It was useless. Did he really go that far? But he went back to the direction where he came before, he should've at least arrived at the shore, right?</p><p> </p><p>And the voice, why did he still hear it? Did they follow him?</p><p> </p><p>"Shit! It's so cold!" He gritted his teeth to keep from trembling.</p><p> </p><p>The voice became louder as if it was getting closer. They were singing something that Ryo couldn't get, it kept echoing around him and he didn't find it beautiful, it just pissed him off. He took off the snorkel and shouted out, "You son of bitch!! Show yourself, coward!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think I'm scared?!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think I'm weak?!! Come here and show yourself now!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Ryo would be lying if he said that he wasn't scared, but he convinced himself that he was braver. The voice sounded farther and farther away and this made him proud of himself. He really thought he was safe and alone this time. But then he heard a voice.</p><p> </p><p>No, the voices. There were a lot of voices like a choir singing around him, a melodious song echoing in the sea and no matter how hard he tried to swim, he felt like he didn't move. The voices were still there, frightening him out. </p><p> </p><p>He couldn't stop his teeth from trembling. Sweat, tears and the cold water on his face were mixed, his lips became pale. It was getting colder and colder and he started realizing the song. </p><p> </p><p>He was terrified. Fear wrapped him tight and he didn't think he could swim again.</p><p> </p><p>No he had to. He had to swim to the shore. He didn't want to die from the cold in the sea. He tried to move his arms, gathering his strength to swim.</p><p> </p><p>The song kept echoing around him as he tried catching his own breath. His eyes stung and everything was blurred. He blinked hard to wash away his tears. As he opened his eyes, he saw something floating in front of him. And how shocked he was when he realized that it looked the same as him. More likely, the dead version of him. </p><p> </p><p>Ryo was screaming when he found out that it was just a head that looked the same as him. He shut his eyes tight and cried out loud. Wishing for someone to appear and help him.</p><p> </p><p>But instead of someone, there was a big wood floating around him and he grabbed it, leaned himself on it as he cried. And the voices, he was still hearing them. They were getting louder and louder, torturing him with their song, making him suffer. </p><p> </p><p>He was exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>He was cold.</p><p> </p><p>He felt hopeless.</p><p> </p><p>He screamed again and again, asking anyone to stop their song, stopping him from suffering. And as he wished, the voice became softened. It calling his name again and again, making him sleepy. </p><p> </p><p>He couldn't feel his body as fatigue wrapped him tight and he couldn't hold back his heavy eyes.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬Take some rest, Ryo… ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♬ Take some rest ♬</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He knew that he would die if he closed his eyes, but he couldn't help it. He was exhausted. Maybe it was better if he just shut his eyes, letting himself drown in the middle of the sea.</p><p> </p><p>So he did that.</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>"Woaah! As expected from the best Siren. " The girl with a golden tail fin said to her friend after seeing another beautiful scene up there. </p><p> </p><p>"That was too easy for him. He might just have wanted to play around. Right, Taiga?" said the other girl with a glimmering tail fin like a ruby, named Remi. She greeted Taiga who just came down after playing around.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't say anything as he thought that he had no need to give them an answer. After all, they were right. </p><p> </p><p>"You don't want to eat these again this time?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained silent for a few minutes before glancing at Remi and answered her, "No, you guys can have it."</p><p> </p><p>"As expected."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam away and entered his place to take some rest. He had fun with them. But it was tiring and he needed to recharge his energy. Maybe good food would come sooner. </p>

<p>There was a place in the deep ocean, a very dark place with a high pressure inside and cold water and it's known as the cave. The walls are made of bumpy stone and stalactites hanging in the ceiling. There were a few rocks inside and chewed bones scattered on the ground. The cave has only one narrow entrance so it doesn't get much sunlight. There were not many animals inside, only some of them that could survive in that kind of place like starfish, snailfish, and a siren named Kyomoto Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>Unlike the other fish or the other sirens that love to gather in wreckage of a plane falling in the ocean or a sunken ship, Taiga preferred the small and the dark cave underwater to be his place because no one would bother him inside. He found this place years ago when he caught a prey (<em>a good prey</em>) but he couldn't eat them all at once. He had to keep them. So he took them with him while swimming through the ocean until he found this place.</p><p> </p><p><em>"Such a good place to keep my food,"</em> he thought. </p><p> </p><p>Why did he keep his food meanwhile the other sirens would eat their food in one sitting after hunting and then hunt again later when they are hungry? </p><p> </p><p>It's just because Taiga was simply... different.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't go hunting frequently, but when he saw good prey, he would catch them and keep them in a good place, eating them bit by bit, leaving the rest for him to eat later when he was hungry. He didn't eat that much, he wasn't hungry for blood or flesh, he would eat just enough then kept them and that's how he never ran out of food.</p><p> </p><p>He would just spend his time resting, or watching other sirens singing (hunting), or seeing them arguing with each other about their food or showing off their skills, or watching other sirens talking and somehow flirting with others to find a mate. Taiga wasn't interested in any of them. They looked the same for him and they're not on the same level. </p><p> </p><p>He preferred to be alone. He didn't have to share his place, he didn't have to talk or argue with other sirens, he didn't have to find a mate and he didn't have to share his food. If he died, then he would die alone and he didn't find any problem with it. They're the same, the predators of humans, or monsters (that's how human see them).</p><p> </p><p>But he was popular. He was so popular because of how elegant his look, how good his capabilities were and how cruel he was. Nobody wanted to make any trouble with him.</p><p> </p><p>He used to be alone but it didn't mean that he had no friends (or maybe that was what other sirens did to him, pairing him with the others and then calling them a group called the great sirens). There was Juri with his glittering blue tail and wide flukes, dark green eyes and black short hair, scales on his left cheek making him look handsome. He's good at catching his victims with his orotund voice. When they listened to his song, they would get dizzy, stressed, or have an extreme headache that made them want to kill themselves. </p><p> </p><p>The other one was Remi with her red tail glistened like rubies, thin flukes twisted in the end like ribbons, white eyes and shoulder length hair in the same color as her eyes. She could catch her victims with her feathery voice and when they listened to her song, they would see butterflies and flowers around them, making them want to pick one of them and eat them. Without them realizing that they ate themselves and dived into the sea.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile Taiga, he's like the strongest siren with many great capabilities. He could change his voice as he wanted, like making songs that sounded euphonic, soporific, or ethereal. He could make the most beautiful song ever with only his voice. Calling the fog was also his forte. That's why whenever he sang, the fog would come and surround them and the air would become colder and colder.</p><p> </p><p>While the others kill quickly, Taiga prefers to kill slowly. He gave such a great performance on his own show and made them suffer. He could also choose between his prey which one he wanted to kill first or who he wanted to hear his voice, making them confused, hypnotizing them, and killing them bit by bit.</p><p> </p><p>Because of his capabilities and how cruel he was while killing humans, Taiga was known as the most sadistic Siren and became the favorite of The King of The Sirens. </p><p> </p><p>Sirens are similar to humans. They're alive and they could be dead. The difference between them and humans is just that they don't have mercy. They're craving for flesh and being cruel to others apart from them (means to humans). They live in the ocean, but they could sense their prey many kilometers away from them. They were willing to go up or swim away to the sea to see their prey and distract them by their voices, inviting them to come closer. </p><p> </p><p>No matter whether they were good or bad, small or big, old or young, if sirens were hungry, they would definitely hunt them. Even they would love to help especially those humans who attempted suicide.</p><p> </p><p>If they sensed that their prey would come, they would catch them and destroy them. Mostly sirens would eat humans in general but Taiga, he's quite <em>picky</em>. Sirens could understand some of human nature. Humans would show their true self when they're sailing and Taiga took the opportunity to pick his prey. His favorite body part is their heart. So he only wanted humans with a good heart and kept it for the last. He didn't want humans with a bad heart. Based on his experience, he caught a bad one many years ago and he said their heart and flesh tasted bitter. It wasn't the same with innocent humans, they tasted sweet. </p><p> </p><p>But if he was bored, he could just play around with his prey. </p><p> </p><p>Like this time.</p><p> </p><p>He just finished eating his food and he had enough rest earlier. He was bored and he didn't think he could find something interesting. So he went out of his place and swam to Juri's place to meet him. He was bored and maybe being with Juri would be more interesting. </p><p> </p><p>"Yae saw three boys sailing up there. They're still a few kilometers away from us, though. Is anyone hungry?" Remi asked the sirens around her, but it seemed like they were already full. She just caught a large ship of fishermen passing by above. They could just kill again but it might be a waste of energy. </p><p> </p><p>"No one? Juri?" </p><p> </p><p>Juri didn't give any answer as he kept his eyes closed, he was probably sleeping. </p><p> </p><p>"Well maybe Yae can do it by herself."</p><p> </p><p>"Eh? I-... I'm not confident with my capability…" Yae's voice was soft, too soft and made it difficult for humans to hear her. </p><p> </p><p>"I will go." Taiga said as he swam closer.</p><p> </p><p>"You really want to go for them? There were only three boys and they might just be some arrogant boys who want to show off!" Juri said suddenly, feeling surprised by Taiga's words.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't say anything and swam away leaving them, reaching those boys who would arrive sooner. He swam quietly as he saw the silhouette of the boat a few meters away from him. He went up to check his victims before he started his game. There were three boys in a small boat without any flashlights in his hands. One of them was wearing glasses and the rest were wearing a hat. Taiga went back into the water and followed them quietly, listening to them arguing over the distance. He smiled at himself as he heard the other boy insist on going further. </p><p> </p><p>"They really don't know how far they're going, huh." He said while smirking. </p><p> </p><p>He kept his distance away from them as he heard one of them would dive. He moved his tail and swam under the boat, staying for a moment while watching the boy going down and shoveling some sand with something on his neck. Taiga looked up to the boat and saw the other boys were waiting for their friends to come back. A smirk formed on his lips after targeting his first victim.</p><p> </p><p>He swam away from the boat and went deeper to keep his distance from the boy who dived in. As he thought he was far enough from the boy, he stopped swimming and turned his body, straightened himself and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before he let out his voice. Just a single voice that sounded beautiful and echoing around the sea. He kept humming his song as he kept his mind on the boy who drove the boat. He started calling his name afterwards, again and again, making a beautiful song just by his name. Taiga's song was soft, yet strong. It would be so hard for his target to ignore him, making him freeze and not having any options but to listen to his song.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stopped his singing for a few seconds, he opened his eyes and smiled softly before he started singing again, letting his voice reach the other boy and hypnotized him.</p><p> </p><p>He increased his volume bit by bit to scare them. The fog was coming as he made his voice softened, producing beautiful melodies just by his voice and echoing through the sea. It was getting louder and louder, and then softer and softer until the boy couldn't hear him, manipulating him as if they were getting away, but they were just going further and further. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga smirked again as he kept his voice only to his first target, singing another beautiful song about the sea, hypnotizing him with his melody. He made him see the beauty around, the glimmering stars on the water, promising him to see more and more and making him greedier. He kept calling his name with his melodious voice and dragged him to jump into the sea by his voice.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Come here, Haruto ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Come to see me, I'm the most beautiful thing you would ever see… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Come to me… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Ohh come here… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A smirk formed on his beautiful lips while watching Hikaru dived in, letting him drown deeper and deeper into the deep sea, leaving him out of breath until death greeted him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moved to his next target. An arrogant boy who insisted on going further and sacrificed his own friends. He hated this kind of human. He didn't even want to eat them. He wanted to go back but his show had to be finished. So he followed him.</p><p> </p><p>He could see the boy was swimming up when he was done with the task. He watched him from below, seeing him stopped for a while and swam again going further. Taiga let out a chuckle when he saw the boy only swam towards his friend in the middle of the sea.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wanted to enjoy it for a few moments before he started his show again. </p><p> </p><p>As he saw the boy start swimming again, he followed him quietly and swam down to the opposite direction as the boy swam up.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga closed his eyes after seeing the boy stopped. He started singing one tone only to hear the reaction. His voice sounded too soft but it reached him and he was sure that the fog had come surrounding the boy. He opened his eyes and saw the boy was swimming further. Taiga smiled and sang another tone and made it longer this time as he wanted to show off.</p><p> </p><p>He kept singing and singing another tone again and again until he created a song with them. His voice sounded soft and sweet and it was echoing around the sea. He made his voice sound as if he was singing behind his victim and scared them. This one was also his forte. Not only choose the victim but also he could control his voice. He made his voice sound ethereal. </p><p> </p><p>He was going to sing another song but then he heard a scream, a very loud scream that annoyed him.</p><p> </p><p>"SHOW YOURSELF, COWARD!!!" </p><p> </p><p>"DO YOU THINK I'M SCARED?!!" </p><p> </p><p>"DO YOU THINK I'M WEAK?!! COME HERE AND SHOW YOURSELF NOW!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clicked his tongue and stared cynically to nothing.</p><p> </p><p>"I really hate that kind of human."</p><p> </p><p>He <em>hated</em> this kind of human the most. </p><p> </p><p>He could just kill him right away by his squeaky voice until the boy's head exploded. But he wouldn't do that. He wanted to make him suffer any longer. He wanted to make him frightened. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga wanted to <em>teach</em> him about how bad his behavior was to him, the most sadistic siren in the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He gritted his fangs as he lit a fire inside him and swam deeper. </p><p> </p><p>He opened his eyes that glowed in the dark before attacking his victim. He swam fastly around the boy, creating a vertex under the deep sea, then he went up as he started singing. He called the boy's name again and again with a harmonious voice and created a melodious song afterwards. A story that he used to tell to a greedy human.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ There was a man with a big brain ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ And his two friends without brain ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Sailing to the sea, looking for the lost treasure ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ They were a great team before, until selfishness ate their soul ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ The man with a big brain cell asked his two friends to dive into the sea ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Promised that he would give them half of the treasure ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Selfishness ate their soul, craving for more and more… So they dived in ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ The man saw his friends bringing what he was looking for, taking it then throwing his friends… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Killing them without any weapon… and leaving their bodies to drown into the ocean ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ But he forgot he wasn't the only one who looked for it ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga moved his wide and beautifully flukes up and down slowly, going deeper and deeper as he kept singing his beautiful (terrified) song. His voice was getting softer and softer but he managed to awaken the deepest fear in the boy's mind. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Did he manage to survive? ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Did he manage to live? ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Did he manage to save his own head? ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He kept singing as if he didn't bother hearing another scream up there, begging anyone to stop, asking to end his own life from suffering. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiled before he softened his voice, calling the boy's name with his harmonious voice, asking him to sleep. And the next thing that he saw was the boy fainted and drowned into the sea and entered the vertex that he made earlier.</p><p> </p><p>He finished his song and watched the death kissing the boy's body with a satisfied smile forming on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Rest well, smart boy." He said while smiling sweetly. </p><p> </p><p>"Ah, I'm thirsty…" He gulped as he felt his throat drying. He needed to drink, he didn't expect that his game would drain his energy this much.</p><p> </p><p>"That boy made me tired." He clicked his tongue again and turned his face to the last victim up there. </p><p> </p><p>The last one. The last boy that he had to drag into his game. But Taiga was tired, and he wanted to end this quickly.</p><p> </p><p>He swam fastly to the boat in the middle of the sea while humming another song before he started singing, his voice sounded shrill as he saw the boy leaving him. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Where are you going, Toru? ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Toru, wait for me ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Oh My dear Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Don't leave me… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He kept calling his name again and again (Taiga loves calling other's names). He kept his voice soft as he heard a whimper up there. He changed his song and tried to comfort him, telling him that he would be okay. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Why are you crying? ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Don't cry ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Don't cry… I'm here for you ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ It's okay… It's okay, Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>This time, Taiga swam closer to the boat as he made sure that the boy could hear him clearly. He could see Toru's back trembling. He swam again under the boat and bit the boat with his fangs, causing a small hole because he didn't want Toru to feel the cold water all at once.</p><p> </p><p>He moved his tail slowly, swimming deeper while humming, softened his voice as he heard Toru was crying. He stopped and turned around, looking up at the boat before calling him. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ My dear Toru… It's okay ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ You will be okay with me ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ So just sleep… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Sleep, Toru… ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>♫ Sleep… and you will be okay ♫</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his body and swam away when he saw the boat sinking into the sea. Drowning deeper and deeper until it crashed. He left his victims alone and went back to his place, telling other sirens that he was finished with his job.</p><p> </p><p>"Woaah! As expected from the best siren." Yae said when she saw him coming back. Apparently she watched him all this time, probably wanted to learn something from the best siren. </p><p> </p><p>"That was too easy for him. He might just have wanted to play around. Right, Taiga?" said Remi.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't say anything because she already knew the answer. Remi knew him well because they used to hunt together back then. </p><p> </p><p>"You don't want to eat these again this time?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained silent for a few minutes before glancing at Remi and gave her an answer, "No, you guys can have it."</p><p> </p><p>He left them and swam away to his place. He was thirsty, he needed to drink. As he arrived, he took a cup of blood from his storage and sipped it fastly. </p><p> </p><p>"Ahhhh… Sweet..." He said and put the cup back onto its place. He moved to his bed (which was a rock) and took some rest. Playing around with those boys drained his energy. He needed to eat but before that, he wanted to enjoy and rest his body for a while after working hard.</p><p> </p><p>"I hope good food will come sooner for my payment." Taiga said to himself before he closed his eyes, letting him sleep before he fed himself with another flesh. </p>

<p>Hokuto opened his eyes slowly as he heard the bird's song from his alarm vibrated in his ears. The sunlight peeked from its window and woke him up. His hand fumbled above the bedside to find the clock.</p><p> </p><p>7.10 am, still a bit early to start the day but Hokuto had to wake up early. He had been like this in the past year. This habit helped him to refresh his mind, giving him some peace and distracted him so he wouldn't think of any painful memories. </p><p> </p><p>Especially in this house.</p><p> </p><p>He opened the curtain and its window, stretching his body and greeting the sun. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the smell of flowers after rainfall last night. He closed his eyes and let the autumn breeze touch his face, feeling the gentleness of nature in the morning. As he heard the bird whistle among the gentle breeze on his ears, a short memory of him and his father crossed his mind.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered when he was young, he had been friends with nature. His father was a photographer of nature and Hokuto used to travel with him anywhere to explore the beauty of them. He visited a lot of places around the world, seeing rivers and their waterfalls, the forest and their animals. He had seen many of them and learned about a lot of things. The beauty of nature, the balance of them, the profits that we can get from them, and the importance of protecting them and keeping them in balance. He remembered his father's wise words back then when they were eating sandwiches while listening to the sound of the running river.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Nature gives us life, son. We live side by side with other humans, animals, and plants on this earth. Each of us takes many advantages of earth. But we have to keep them in balance. Between animals, us, and plants, the one that could protect our world is us. Be kind and be wise, son."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Those words stayed in his mind all the time. He couldn't stop thinking about what he could do to earth, to help them, to protect them. And he chose his path to be a scientist.</p><p> </p><p>As his mind brought another memory of them, a ping sound of his phone distracted him. He walked closer to his desk and took his phone, checking the messages that had been piled up, waiting to be replied. A smile etched on his lips when he read the last message from his old friend, Kochi. Telling him that he would meet him today after his flight from N country.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p align="right">
<em>Don't forget my gift!</em>
</p>
</blockquote><p>He smiled to himself after sending his reply to Kochi, wishing him to have a safe flight before he went out of his room to take a shower.</p><p> </p><p>The cold water poured on his body and gave his goosebumps. He rubbed his arms and breathed heavily as his body tried to adjust with the water. He forgot that the electricity in its shower was broken so it couldn't change the water temperature. He took the honey-scented shampoo (that belonged to someone else) on the shelf and poured it onto his hand, washing his curly black hair gently after he turned the shower off before he froze from its water. He took the honey lemon soap beside it and washed his body. He did it to shorten the time, so he didn't have to deal with the cold water any longer. </p><p> </p><p>When he's done, Hokuto wrapped a towel on his torso and on his hair to dry himself. He walked toward the mirror in his bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth. He applied some skincare on his face before walking out of the bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>He went to the kitchen to make breakfast and a lunchbox for him. He chose to have a sandwich and a cup of coffee. After finishing his breakfast, he prepared his lunch box. He took some pieces of sausage and a small pack of veggies and cooked them together. He also made tamagoyaki and placed them neatly on its box. </p><p> </p><p>"Finished!" he said while a satisfied smile formed on his lips. After he cleaned up the kitchen and washed the dishes, he walked into his room to change himself before going to the office. </p><p> </p><p>He wore a white shirt and an oversized trousers with caramel coat and a black backpack. He also brought a bottle of coffee in his hands then went outside and locked the door. Hokuto stayed in S country, living in a small apartment near to the beach and surrounded by friendly neighbors. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh Hokuto!!! Good morning!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning, Nakayama-san. How are you doing?" Hokuto greeted him back while smiling warmly. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm good!! My wife slept peacefully last night after talking a lot with you. I think she likes you that much."</p><p> </p><p>"No no, Nakayama-san. I just listened to her worries like you do."</p><p> </p><p>"You're just being humble. Thank you for listening to my wife's worries." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shook his head slowly and gave a soft smile, "I'm glad if I could help."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! Please take this!" Nakayama said as he handed him a lunchbox. </p><p> </p><p>"Eeh is it okay? Thank you so much!"</p><p> </p><p>"I cooked it this morning. I'm good at cooking so don't worry about the taste."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let out an airy laugh, "I believe in your taste, Nakayama-san. Don't worry!" he said while smiling brightly. Hokuto bowed once again and bid him good-bye as he walked away with a lunchbox in his hand. Hokuto was a newcomer in this small town, living in a new place alone, but his ikemen face with black curly hair and his gentle smile like an angel caught attention. He became popular. Whenever he walked alone, they would greet him. Some of them even gave him seafood like crabs, shellfish, or fishes. Hokuto didn't know the reason they gave it, but he felt grateful for being treated like that. </p><p> </p><p>"Morning!" Hokuto greeted his friends as he arrived at their office, placing his lunchbox and his bag on its desk.</p><p> </p><p>"Good morning…" said Sato, a tanned guy with glasses wearing a beanie hat, sitting beside him while eating a piece of onigiri.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto poured his coffee into its cup and handed it to Sato. He took his lab coat and wore it while walking to the lab to do measurements. He was working in the Environmental Science and Health Institution for around 5 years and then moved to dedicate himself to an organization Ocean Society. He found out about this new organization a few years ago through the news on TV. They wanted to gather public awareness to take any action about issues of ocean health and to build a global community of people working toward improved ocean stewardship. Basically his job was to control and monitor the state of the ocean, he also participated in some research on marine conservation. Some of his friends moved from one country to another (Kochi was one of them) depending on how many volunteers were needed and Hokuto was one of the three scientists that stayed in this small town.</p><p> </p><p>"GOOD MORNING!!!!!" said someone with a loud voice from outside and distracted Hokuto from his work. He looked at him, who was wearing a yellow jacket, smiling brightly as he walked towards Sato and greeted him. Hokuto tried to ignore it and went back to his work, letting those noises fill the room as he kept his eyes on the microscope. As he wanted to continue to the next sample, someone called him and waved hand at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Kochi?!" he said with eyes widened in surprise, seeing his friend was standing there with a big grin and a small bag on his hands. Hokuto took off his gloves and walked outside, smiling happily as he looped his arms around Kochi, his old friend.</p><p> </p><p>"Why didn't you tell me that you've arrived?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why did I have to do that?" Kochi said jokingly, "I heard that you guys are trying to get more people to join, so I came to help," he continued. Kochi had the same work as Hokuto's father, he was a photographer of nature but Kochi also dedicated himself to be a volunteer for Ocean Society. He helped to gain online public attention by publishing his pictures and his writing skills. The place where Hokuto lived was small, but lacked care. So they targeted to gain public attention about this place, especially the ocean. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled as he tapped Kochi's back, thanking him for going back to help them. </p><p> </p><p>"Where is my gift?"</p><p> </p><p>"You really just want a gift, don't you?" Kochi rolled his eyes before he handed him a small paper bag. Hokuto took it with a wide smile formed on his lips, feeling excited to get a small gift. </p><p> </p><p>But his smile faded when he lowered his head to look into it. He raised his head and stared at Kochi for a while, then cleaned his throat before he let out his words.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you give me this?" Hokuto whispered as he gritted his teeth, glaring at Kochi who acted innocent. </p><p> </p><p>"Why not? Maybe you want to put your dick into someone else and—..." Hokuto silenced Kochi's mouth before he spitted everything out. He looked at Sato who watched them from his seat, staring confusedly towards them. Hokuto forced a smile and dragged Kochi out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>"You've lost your mind, Kochi Yugo." </p><p> </p><p>"I was kidding."</p><p> </p><p>"It's not funny!" Because indeed, it wasn't funny for Hokuto to get a pack of condoms as a handgift from his friend.</p><p> </p><p>"Well… maybe you want to try to fuck someone else butt?"</p><p> </p><p>"What the fuck!!" Hokuto said with furrowed eyebrows, while Kochi was laughing freely at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright, forgive me." He said after a while, feeling guilty for annoying his friend.</p><p> </p><p>"I was just... trying to cheer you up. I know this past year has been tough for you after breaking up with Yuki... " Kochi continued again, making a thin line on his lips, feeling bad for bringing up this topic as he saw Hokuto avoiding his eyes. Not wanting to talk about his past relationships with his ex.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you..."</p><p> </p><p>"No, you don't have to apologize." Hokuto said right away. "The past is in the past. We're here in the present." Hokuto spoke in a soft voice, clenching his hand into a fist as the painful memories came to hit him again. Thus wasn't a right time to be sentimental </p><p> </p><p>"Thank you anyway, for the condom." Hokuto said calmly while holding the pack of condoms in his hands, making Kochi bursted out laughing again as he saw how pitiful his friend was.</p><p> </p><p>That was how their friendship went. If Hokuto could say, he didn't see Kochi as his friend, but as a brother. Maybe he could say their friendship more like Tom and Jerry. They loved to tease or make fun of each other, get mad at each other or be silly at little things. But Hokuto was never really mad at him. Kochi was there for him when his father passed away, when he felt like the world was crashing onto him. He was there and saved him. He couldn't be mad at Kochi for not being there physically when his ex-girlfriend left him and tore his heart apart. There were a lot of good things that Kochi had done to him and Hokuto was happy to see him again.</p><p> </p><p>"Ummm, Matsumura-san?" Someone called him and interrupted their talks, "do you have some time? Kochi-san too." Hokuto looked at Kochi and gave a nod to Yamada, a boy with glasses and wearing an oversized black t-shirt and black jeans standing in the doorway and waiting for them. </p><p> </p><p>"So we have some projects and research in the future, but we lack funds. We need more help from people, and our plans to gain public attention about this place is the Whale Watching Tour." Yamada said after serving them two cups of tea. </p><p> </p><p>"Whale watching tour?" Kochi asked.</p><p> </p><p>Yamada nodded and answered him, "yes, Kochi-san. We will have a small trip in a day and a whale watching tour."</p><p> </p><p>"Are there any whales here?" Hokuto asked after a while, "I have never gone further to the place where we can see whales."</p><p> </p><p>"We still don't know about that..."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a glance at Kochi before he let out another question. </p><p> </p><p>"There's no information at all?"</p><p> </p><p>"There are a few articles about this place, but none of them ever mentioned whales. Only sea turtle conservation and it was a few years ago. Oh anyway, Sea Turtle Conservation will be our future project too."</p><p> </p><p>"So we need to check it before we can continue to the next step."</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, Kochi-san." Yamada smiled as he looked at both of them as if he still had something to ask.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry for asking again, Matsumura-san, but would you please accompany me to take a small trip for this? Kento can't help because his wife is in the hospital. I can't go with Sato and the rest are busy with other preparations." </p><p> </p><p>"Yeah! Sure of course I'd like to help. But I still need to finish the measurement. When will we go?"</p><p> </p><p>"Whenever you have time but if you don't mind, we can go this afternoon. Maybe around 4." Yamada formed a thin line as he waited for Hokuto's answer. Yamada looked at Kochi then asked him, "Kochi-san too, please join us."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi nodded and smiled widely as he looked at Hokuto, telling him that he was fine as if he could read Hokuto's mind that he was worried about him after a long flight. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, we can leave at 4."</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>The autumn breeze blew towards him, brushing away his bangs gently. The smell of sand filled his lungs, bringing the fresh air inside him. The beautiful sound of waves collided with the shore vibrated through his ears, soothing his soul. The soft and fluffy clouds covered the sky, holding back the sun from shining brightly to the earth. Upon the autumn breeze on the beach, Hokuto let himself get carried away by the beauty of nature. </p><p> </p><p>He always loved nature, but the beach, the waves, and the ocean have special places in his heart. He barely visited the beach or had a trip through to the ocean because his father didn't let him join. <em>It's dangerous,</em> he would say. So Hokuto was always curious about it. What would he see on the sea, how beautiful it would be. He was always curious about that. He could see them on TV or know the story from others, but he wanted to tell his own story. He couldn't deny that it was also one of his reasons to join the Ocean Society. He wanted to protect the place that he never visited before, he wanted to create more beautiful memories with it, and he wanted to experience it.</p><p> </p><p>He was happy when Yamada asked him to join him even though he didn't show it on his face, because the day that he had been waiting for has come. Having a trip, a short trip, visiting the ocean, enjoying the blue water and its magic in front of his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto patiently waited for Kochi to come back after placing his luggage in his house (he agreed when Kochi asked him to stay in his house for a while until he found a new apartment). Yamada had finished preparing the ship for them and as Hokuto walked towards it, Kochi called them out loud while waving his hand, a camera hanging on his neck. </p><p> </p><p>"Come on!!!" Hokuto shouted back at him, waving back at him, signaling him to come faster as he kept walking until he reached the ship and got on it.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait…." Kochi said as he bent down exhausted and tried to catch some air.</p><p> </p><p>"You run out of breath just by running this short distance?" Hokuto asked jokingly with an eyebrow raised.</p><p> </p><p>"I was running from your house!!" said Kochi after catching some air.</p><p> </p><p>"Nobody told you to run."</p><p> </p><p>Well, Hokuto was right. But it made Kochi pissed off. His jaw dropped and his eyes widened in surprise after hearing what Hokuto said to him. He was ready to curse Hokuto and his mouth but Yamada held him and told him to get on the ship.</p><p> </p><p>"Is it too big for the three of us?" Kochi asked while walking on the ship.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to swim?"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi clicked his tongue and before he could argue more, Yamada had stopped them and asked Kochi <em>again</em> to take a seat. </p><p> </p><p>After making sure that they didn't leave anything behind, Yamada led them to leave the shore and went to the sea slowly. Hokuto couldn't hide his excitement as he kept his eyes widened, a wide smile formed on his lips and his hair was blowing due to the strong wind. He looked behind and he barely saw the shore as they kept going. The blue water stretches as far as the eye could see, giving peace to his mind. The sound of a group of birds formed neatly on the sky and the strong wind in the middle of the sea mixed together, echoing in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes wandered and found some fishermen around. Some of them were his neighbors. They waved their hands towards him, calling him out loud and asking him where he wanted to go. The silence in the middle of the sea was gone as their voices echoed around.</p><p> </p><p>"You're popular, huh?" Kochi stood beside him after taking some pictures.</p><p> </p><p>"I told you, I'm a good man." Hokuto said proudly, yet looking away as he started holding his smile, feeling embarrassed of what he just said about himself.</p><p> </p><p>"They're good people." Hokuto said after passing them. "They're friendly with the newcomers in this countryside. They just... lack knowledge about how to look after this place and its ecosystem." </p><p> </p><p>Kochi hummed as he nodded, "that's why you chose to stay here?" he asked, "isn't it more painful for you to stay in this place?" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned his face away after hearing Kochi's words. Why did he have to ask something that was clear enough? Indeed it was painful for him. He had been staying here for 3 years and during that time he also lived with his ex-girlfriend im his current house. Meeting her in this place when he was still mourning because of his father, receiving so many loves from her, making him feel safe, loved, and joyed. But then things didn't work and he had to deal with another pain. It took months for him to start a new life. Of course it was difficult for him, he wanted to run away, but he loved this place. He wanted to stay here. He wanted to create more memories here and replaced the painful memories inside him.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe my love for nature is bigger than I thought." He said softly. </p><p> </p><p>Kochi patted his back as he let out a long sigh, "You're a good man," Kochi said before moving away, leaving him alone on the right side of the ship. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked at his watch and he was surprised that it had been one hour since they left the shore. But as he remembered, he didn't see a whale or dolphin around. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto!! Come here!!" He turned to Kochi who called him suddenly, holding some onigiri in his hands and showing it to him. He gave a thin smile and walked towards them.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind if we wait for another 30 minutes, perhaps?" Yamada asked after swallowing his food. Hokuto shook his head as he chewed his onigiri. They still had time before the sun went down. If they were lucky enough, maybe they would see dolphins or whales in a few minutes.</p><p> </p><p>And as they wished, after waiting for another 30 minutes, they saw something big swimming under the ocean. His eyes widened in excitement, waiting for the beautiful creatures to appear in front of them. Kochi was ready with his camera and Yamada kept his eyes under the ship. Hokuto could feel excitement running in his veins as he saw a silhouette underwater swimming closer to them. And as he thought, a very big whale in black and white color covered its body appeared in front of them. Hokuto smiled brightly when he saw there was another whale in the same color appeared behind them.</p><p> </p><p>"That's an orca!!" Yamada said as he pointed at them. Kochi was busy taking pictures of them while Hokuto couldn't take his eyes off of them. They were swimming freely as if they were dancing in front of him, greeting him with the beautiful colors and very cute voices like a whistle. </p><p> </p><p>"They sound like dolphins..." he said softly with eyes sparkling. It was such an unbelievable moment for him when he saw two orcas swimming beautifully in front of him. He couldn't hide his happiness as he kept smiling widely, keeping his eyes on them, creating beautiful memories inside him. He couldn't believe that one of his dreams came true, when he had a trip through the ocean, enjoying the view of the blue water, the sound of waves, and the whistle of birds upon the sky. And now he had a trip while watching two orcas swimming beside them.</p><p> </p><p>Such a very beautiful memory to keep in his mind. It felt like this could wash away his pain, making him forget how broken his heart was, how hard he dealt with his pain when she left him, and how hard he fought to stay here, dealing with his pain just because he wanted to protect this place. And he had no regrets. Just as his words to Kochi, his love for nature was bigger than he thought. He got so carried away by his feelings that he didn't even realize tears dropped from his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Being sentimental again?" Kochi asked suddenly while holding a bottle of water in his hand.</p><p> </p><p>"Shut up..." Hokuto said as he wiped his tears with his thumb, smiling bitterly and sniffed his running nose.</p><p> </p><p>They kept talking and talking about some silly stories of their childhood. Yamada, who just came from checking their fuel, told them that he would turn their ship back. Kochi walked towards him to help him as Hokuto stayed where he stood, enjoying a little bit of time by watching the twilight sky. The clouds had gone bit by bit and he could see the sun clearly. The sun emitted the light to the red-ish ocean, the autumn wind touched his body and made him shiver. Hokuto pulled up his coat around his neck and pocketed his own hands.</p><p> </p><p>He moved to the back of the ship, saying goodbye to the ocean. He felt like he could watch the waves foam under their ship and the glimmering sunlight on the water all day. It was really beautiful and gave him peace of mind. He just wanted to stay here longer. Since Hokuto stood alone in the back, he didn't know how far they were going. He couldn't hear Kochi or Yamada's voices so he looked back, eyes wandering around to find his friends. But he couldn't find them.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe they're inside," he mumbled to himself. Hokuto then moved forward to go inside the ship. But his step had stopped as he heard a voice. A mesmerizing voice calling him. He turned back to check it but he found nothing. He looked around to find someone who called him, but still nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Who was it?</p><p> </p><p>Was he hallucinating?</p><p> </p><p>He shook his head and tapped his cheeks a few times to bring back his focus. But before he moved again, his ears caught a voice, a singing voice. Hokuto was sure it was the same voice as before but this one sounded different. This one sounded calm and soft, soothing him as if he had been showered by pleasant feelings through his head into his heart, and his soul.  </p><p> </p><p>He couldn't tell if he was dreaming or not. There was no one around yet it was clearly echoing around the ocean. He must be dreaming but the voice sounded too real to be called a dream. It sounded... familiar.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto inhaled deeply and breathed slowly as the voice echoing through his ears, his mind tried to remember who had a voice like this but he couldn't. The singing had stopped, the voice was gone for a moment. But before Hokuto realized, the voice had come again, calling him softly with a tone that was full of gentleness and warmth, making him feel loved. Beautiful memories crossed in his mind one by one, reminding him of how happy he was. He's happy now, indeed, but he felt different... He couldn't deny that the hole caused by Yuki inside him was still there. He tried his best to cover it but it was so tough. Until one memory popped up, hitting him hard. There was one time when he spent his time with Yuki. The moment when he felt he was over the moon, it was beautiful, but it had become painful now. The more he saw them inside his mind, the more pain running in his veins. Without him realizing, tears started falling down on his cheeks. And the moment when he lowered his head to look into the blue ocean, he saw her smiling. But then he also saw his father come beside her, smiling softly towards him and waving their hands. </p><p> </p><p>"Father…… Yuki…." Hokuto smiled with tears that kept running on his cheeks. The next thing he did was throw himself to join them into the ocean. </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga saw Hokuto dive in, he moved his tail up and down beautifully to get him. He didn't care with the two of them up there, he was only interested in this one since the first time he saw him. Taiga had a good instinct that it would be a great prey. He moved his tail fastly, catching him before he fell too deep into the ocean. As Taiga grabbed his wrist, he pulled him into his arms and looked at him with hungry eyes while smirking as if he couldn't wait to eat him and tasted his heart. </p><p> </p><p>But he saw something he never expected.</p><p> </p><p>Mostly humans that he caught before, they would die instantly or at least faint with closed eyes while they were drowning in the ocean, but this one was different. Taiga was astounded when he saw Hokuto's face in his arms, his curly hair flew in the water, his eyes slightly opened and stared at him with eyes that Taiga couldn't understand. He was so confused with everything that he didn't even realize a weak hand was placed on his cheeks, and Taiga was sure he could see something that humans probably called tears in the corner of his eyes. Taiga was sure he was singing to make him joyful before he took his life, but why did he cry? Why did this human cry? </p><p> </p><p>Why? </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's mouth slightly opened when he saw Hokuto said something while holding his cheeks, looking at his eyes deeply but Taiga couldn't get it. What did he say? What did he want? Before Taiga could digest his confusion, Hokuto lowered his hand slowly and closed his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga swore he didn't know what he thought, but there was something burning inside him yet he didn't know it. He didn't understand his confusion, he didn't know how this thing could happen. He wasn't sure about many things but one thing, just one thing that he could be sure of for now.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't want to kill him. He didn't want to eat him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga pulled him into his arms and swam to the surface. He looked around to check something and he saw the two people in the ship earlier behind him. Taiga brought himself and Hokuto back and swam in a hurry. He pushed out his energy by moving his tail fastly to reach the shore, wishing the man in his arms was still alive as he kept checking on him a few times, tightened his arms around him, and wishing that nobody would see him or he might be in trouble.</p><p> </p><p>He placed Hokuto gently on the shore, staring at him for a few moments, trying to figure out what he was thinking before. Without him realizing, he placed his cold palm on Hokuto's chest, feeling his weak heartbeat through his soaked clothes into his palm.</p><p> </p><p>Slow, weak, fragile… </p><p> </p><p>"I don't get it..." he said quietly before pulling back his hand. </p><p> </p><p>The sky had become dark. The sun had been replaced by the moon. The wind had become stronger. The waves had called him to go back to the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at him in the last moments before he vanished into the sea. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't get it at all. He was supposed to kill him, eating him, feeding his hungry self, but here he is. Swimming fastly into the ocean with so many thoughts inside him. Confusion filled himself as Hokuto's face stayed in his mind. He didn't even realize that he had reached his place until Juri called him.</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga?"</p><p> </p><p>"I thought you were going to catch your prey!" Taiga paused for a few moments before turning his face towards Juri, "huh?" he asked, frowning.</p><p> </p><p>Well, Juri was right. He <em>was</em> supposed to catch his prey.</p><p> </p><p>"I saw you were going up, and I think I heard your singing."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept his face straight while staring at Juri.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I was up there."</p><p> </p><p>"Did you sing earlier?"</p><p> </p><p>"I did."</p><p> </p><p>"For nothing?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept his face straight before letting out his words. "Is that wrong if I just want to sing?" he asked casually. </p><p> </p><p>"Well… it's just… I've never seen you do that before."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga managed to keep his face straight after hearing Juri's words. He gritted his teeth and turned his face away, moving his tail up and down and swam fastly, leaving Juri in front of the window of the sunken ship, staring at him in wonder. </p><p> </p><p>Also he couldn't tell Juri by saying <em>I let him free by taking him to the shore.</em> Juri definitely would be mad at him because it would be bad for them, sirens. Then he would definitely ask him some questions that Taiga himself didn't know the answer to yet. He was still confused with his own thoughts, why did he have to bother to explain it to others? </p><p> </p><p>As he entered the cave, he was swimming further towards his hiding place between the two rocks. Facing his chest to the ground while floating, staring at the scattered bones in front of him while his mind kept wondering about the same thing. What was the meaning of those eyes, Hokuto's deep eyes that were staring at him as if he was telling him something, the touch of his weak hand over his cheek, and the soft movement of his lips said something that Taiga still didn't understand. </p><p> </p><p>What did he say? What did he want?</p><p> </p><p>"Help me?.... Save me?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"......Kill me?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his body around, letting himself completely rested on the ground as his eyes wandered to the stalactites in the ceiling. He wasn't sure about many things. It was clear that he didn't get what Hokuto said, but why did he still save him? He could just kill him right away no matter what he said. Why did he choose to save him? Being bothered to take him to the shore even though he knew he shouldn't have done that because if humans saw him, they would definitely hunt him even though he was stronger than them. It was just a simple that the land isn't a place for sirens and the ocean isn't a place for humans. Yet he was still there, saving the man that was supposed to be his food.</p><p> </p><p>What did Taiga think? What was something that burned inside him? What was something that told him to save Hokuto? What was something that prickled inside him and gave a little pain around his chest.</p><p> </p><p>What was that?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't know. He didn't have any idea about it. He never thought or considered about others before. He didn't know what was going on with him.</p><p> </p><p>But there was one thing that he knew, and he was sure about. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He wished to see him again… </p>

<em>Hokuto...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hokuto...</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hokuto... </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto slowly opened his eyes, blinked repeatedly to sharpen the blurred view around him. The beeping sounds and the heavy breath of him filled the room, washing away the silence around him. Hokuto glanced around the room, white color schemed the wall and the blue color of the blanket covered his body. He moved his hand slowly and found out that he had been using oxygen. </p><p> </p><p>He was definitely in the hospital. How long had he been here?</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto shut his eyes again, trying to remember what had happened to him. Some puzzles of memories started becoming one. Everything hit him hard, the memory of him when he heard a voice calling him, then seeing his father and Yuki on the ocean, bringing himself jumped into it to catch them. But when he inhaled the cold water he realized that there was no one there. No one around him. He was all alone, drowning into the cold water in the darkness with a bunch of painful memories that wrapped him tight. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto!!"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi walked in a hurry into his bed and took a seat beside him. Hokuto opened his eyes slowly to look at his friend.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh God!! We found you unconscious on the shore!! I thought we would never see you again!!" Kochi said as he grabbed Hokuto's hand, looking at him with eyes full of worries. </p><p> </p><p>"What the hell are you thinking about!!!" Kochi snapped on him suddenly and threw his hand off him. "Do you really want to end your life?!!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto closed his eyes as he let Kochi's words fill his ears, showering him with his anger but Hokuto knew he was just worried about him. </p><p> </p><p>"Kochi, believe me. I didn't mean to do that." He said after a while, looking at his friend furrowing.</p><p> </p><p>"Then why?!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"Look if you're angry or annoyed because I keep teasing you, I will stop. But please don't ever try to end your life because I can't imagine losing you!!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was stunned after hearing his words. He blinked a few times, trying to let out his words that stuck on his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>"Are.... are you..." he gulped, "are you... in love… with me?"</p><p> </p><p>The silence suddenly filled the room, both were staring at each other while processing their own words.</p><p> </p><p>It happened for a while before Kochi blinked, bringing back his mind and looking away, getting ready to leave him.</p><p>"Bye!"</p><p>Hokuto let out a free laugh while telling Kochi not to leave him.</p><p>"Alright, I'm sorry. Thank you for worrying me," he said while giving a thin smile.</p><p> </p><p>He took off the oxygen and brought his body to sit on its bed. He let out a sigh before continuing to speak as the last memories he had in the ship playing in his head. Maybe he should tell him the truth.</p><p>"I was hearing a voice." Hokuto turned his face, looking straight at Kochi as he continued his story. </p><p> </p><p>"I was alone on the back of the ship, remember? It was when you left me. I can't remember how long I was there, but then I wanted to go back. I was looking for you and Yamada. But I couldn't find you, and then I heard a voice, calling me."</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's jaw straightened as he listened to Hokuto carefully.</p><p> </p><p>"The voice sounded familiar but I don't know who it was. I'm sure I wasn't dreaming, Kochi. I could remember it clearly and it felt too real to be a dream."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto paused for a while, lowering his head as the voice rang in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>"Then some memories come hitting me. Those memories about me and Yuki... " Hokuto swallowed hard as he tried to wash those memories away from him.</p><p> </p><p>"Then I saw her, and my father. I don't know how my father could be there, though. But then... " he took a deep breath, "I jumped into the water," he continued, turning his face at Kochi who looked surprised after knowing the story.</p><p> </p><p>"You're not kidding, are you?"</p><p>"Do I look like that?"</p><p> </p><p>".... No… " Kochi blinked repeatedly, "no, you don't..." he let out a breath that he had been holding.</p><p> </p><p>"I won't blame you if you can't believe it. Even myself still can't believe it either." Hokuto let out a long sigh, bringing his back on the bed and closed his eyes, trying to take some rest. He felt relief by telling Kochi about that, but then another thing was bothering him.</p><p> </p><p>"How did you find me?" He turned his face to Kochi who still looked confused.</p><p> </p><p>"On the shore, Hokuto. I don't know how you could reach it and I don't know how long you had been there, but your body was cold and you looked so pale. I did what I could to help you but it was... useless. Your body didn't react at all. I couldn't even feel your pulse, Hokuto. And I panicked. I thought you were dead!!"</p><p> </p><p>It was his turn to be surprised by Kochi's story.</p><p> </p><p>"It was terrifying." Kochi closed his eyes and shook his head before he continued, "and then an ambulance came, Yamada probably had called them when we found you."</p><p> </p><p>"And you know what the doctor said?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto gulped as he prepared himself to hear the next words.</p><p> </p><p>"Doctor said it was such luck that you could pass your crisis time." Kochi lowered his head and exhaled a long breath, loosening his tensed body as he remembered how terrified he was when the doctor told him those things.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was completely speechless. He couldn't remember how he reached the shore. If he thought about it, the place where he jumped was far enough from the shore. Did someone find him and take him there? Or did the waves carry him?</p><p> </p><p>If it was someone then why did they leave him? Why didn't help him before Kochi came? They could help him before he reached the shore and Hokuto could be saved sooner. Was it possible if the waves carried him? But if it was the waves, it probably carried him anywhere and he might have died before he reached the shore.</p><p> </p><p>The most possible thing that happened to him was someone had taken him to the shore then they left him. They might be too afraid of being accused of being a suspect. So they helped him to the shore and then left him alone until someone came—...</p><p>Wait, that was far-fetched. Hokuto was sure it wasn't like that.</p><p> </p><p>Then how was it? How could he reach the shore? Was it the waves that actually carried him to shore? He had been lucky since that?</p><p>Wait, why did he have to think about it? Did it matter? He was here, breathing and lucky enough for being alive. Why did he have to think about how he could reach the shore? Did it bother him? He could just forget it and—...</p><p> </p><p>...He remembered it.</p><p> </p><p>He remembered what happened to him after he jumped into the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>His memory about the past was blurred slowly and all he could think was just he knew he was drowning. He wanted to move his body but he couldn't. He wanted to hold his breath but it just made him weaker. He surrendered. Everything, every precious moment in his life crossed inside his mind, bringing happiness inside him.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe if he died in this way, it wouldn't be that bad. He could be happy in the afterlife, he could stop thinking about Yuki, and could meet his father.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Yeah, it wouldn't be that bad.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He did think about death for a few seconds until someone grabbed his wrist and pulled him into his embrace. He couldn't remember the face but he remembered the eyes. A pair of round glimmering eyes staring at him for a few moments. His embrace was cold but Hokuto felt warm.</p><p> </p><p>He felt safe. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto changed his mind. He realized he was scared of death. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. He wanted to stay alive. There were a lot of things that he hadn't explored yet. He wanted to see them, he wanted to enjoy more of the beauty of nature and make himself happy. He wanted to spend more time with them, with nature and their animals, with his friends, and if it was possible, he wanted to feel a new love.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to be happy, he didn't want to die.</p><p> </p><p>As his thoughts of being alive filled his mind, he moved his hand with all one's might to reach their cheek. It felt rough as if he touched scales, yet it felt soft. </p><p>Just one thing. There was one thing that stuck in his mind at the last moment.</p><p>He wanted to be alive.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Save me..."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>And he couldn't remember anything after that.</p><p>Was it possible that they brought me to the shore?</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto!!"</p><p> </p><p>Kochi's voice distracted him from his deep thoughts.</p><p>"What are you thinking about?"</p><p>Hokuto looked at him frowning, "nothing," he said as he tried to bury his confusion.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>Hokuto nodded as he tried to convince Kochi.</p><p>"Okay… do you want to eat something?"</p><p>"... Oh yes please, I want ramen." He said spontaneously. Kochi nodded, "okay, I will bring it for you. I'll be back. You take some rest!" he said then left him alone in his room.</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>The waves that were usually calm underwater had started to feel strong. It seemed like the sky was covered by dark clouds, preventing the sunlight from shining through the sky into the earth, making the underwater world even darker. It was not a problem for some of the living creatures in it, the fish still got enough food, and the oxygen they got was still in excess. The sirens got what they wanted. The ecosystem was stable, but not with Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>Day by day had passed after the first time he met someone (a human that was supposed to be his food but he set him free). The gray-ish sky represented his anxiety within him that he didn't understand (he didn't even know since when he started to know about feeling). He even lost interest in hunting prey, ignoring his rumbling stomach. Well, he only ate some fish around him. He didn't matter with the bland taste of them, Taiga just wanted to feed his hungry stomach. He chose to have fish rather than have the bitter flesh of humans from other's sirens. His desire to devour delicious prey seemed to be stored tightly within him. It was something that he couldn't understand. How could he lose his appetite? His mind was too foggy and he was focused on only one thing that had been perched for a week.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>How was he? What happened to him after the last time Taiga carried him to the shore? Was he still alive? Did his friends find him? What if they didn’t? What if he didn’t survive? He still remembered clearly how weak Hokuto’s heartbeat was under his touch. The meaningful eyes that looked at him deeply. The soft movement of his lips said something that until now Taiga still couldn't understand.</p><p> </p><p>He just met him once but Taiga remembered Hokuto clearly. His face, his body, his skin, as if his figure had made a deep impression on him. He didn't understand. Taiga still had no clue about it, but he didn't want to think of it.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept waiting everyday. Spending his time wandering around, swimming to the surface of the water to see anyone's figure. He used to spend his time in his cave, eating flesh or drinking blood, or even taking some rest. Taiga didn't want to go anywhere except for prey or being bored. But not this time. He wasn't hungry, nor was he bored. But waiting patiently between the rocks inside his cave only made him uneasy. He couldn't stop thinking about what if Hokuto comes again accidentally and other sirens catch him? He didn't want it. He never wanted to see it happen. Maybe he just wanted Hokuto to be his prey? Or maybe because of something else? He didn't know. He just kept doing what his instinct told him.</p><p> </p><p>He saw other sirens excusing their prey, watching them behind the darkness while they were busy eating their food. Juri, who probably had been watching him, started asking him about many things.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"I think I've been seeing you a lot wandering around."</p><p>"Are you waiting for something?"</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga kept his mouth shut. He didn't have to tell him about it. Juri couldn't help him. He and Juri weren't that close. He could deal with it alone.</p><p> </p><p>"Why do you follow me?" he asked after a while, he kept his face straight, but Juri could see Taiga was annoyed with what he did to him.</p><p> </p><p>"I just want to know what my friend does. I barely see you eat, you keep leaving your place. You have no intention to join us… Well the last one is something usual, though. But still, Kyomo. What happened to you?"</p><p> </p><p>Here again. How could he tell Juri what happened to him when Taiga himself didn't know the reason. He had been like this for a couple weeks and he still couldn't fucking find the reason why he become like this. He felt sick, he felt like he wanted to throw everything inside of him.</p><p> </p><p>"You know that I am always on my own, don't you? I don't need friends, I don't need you. I can find my own prey. I do me, you do you. " Taiga said coldly as he swam away, leaving Juri again without looking back at how he stared at him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga waited again patiently (how long he had been waiting like this) under the sunlight between the surface of the water. Today's weather seemed nice. The sun shined brightly, the white clouds placed neatly on the sky. The waves underwater had become calm like usual.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was a good time for him.</p><p> </p><p>And as he wished, he could hear someone come closer to him. He moved his glimmering tail up and down slowly, going up to see who it was. He got closer to the boat, a small white boat with something that pushed it forward and drove by itself. Taiga could see someone sitting above it, but he couldn't see their faces, seemed like they bent down. So he swam closer, holding the boat carefully and peeked up to the boat. That human raised his own body and Taiga's eyes widened when he could see their face. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">
<em>A week ago. </em>
</p><p align="left">"Anyway I told Yamada about your story and asked him about our projects. He said he would postpone it for a while until it's safe. We need to make sure that there is nothing dangerous in the ocean."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto hummed as he nodded, he had expected that Yamada wouldn't drop this project. But it was a good thing that he agreed to make sure about this place.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"And he also told me about another thing."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto turned his face to Kochi and saw him looking nervous. "What's that?" he asked calmly. He could clearly see Kochi looked scared.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Remember your story when you heard the voice calling around you?" Hokuto nodded."It happened once many years ago… " Hokuto's eyes widened, staring at his friend in disbelief.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Wh… what do you mean?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yamada said there was a story about three college boys going to the sea in twilight. They took a boat from an ossan that lived around there. He saw them and warned them, not because of the boat, but because he knew they would leave to the sea. He yelled at them and told them it would be dangerous. But none of them listened, and they left." Kochi swallowed hard as a single sweat ran on his temple, meanwhile Hokuto kept his face straight, listening to the story carefully. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"But until the next day, no one had ever seen them again."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Are you sure they weren't coming back?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yamada said that the ossan didn't see his boat. He had looked anywhere around the shore, but nothing."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It seemed unreal but Hokuto couldn't say that because he experienced it. The difference was just… he was still alive.</p><p align="left">"Then what about the fishermen here?" He asked as if looking for other proof.</p><p align="left">"That's it! That's the point!! No one ever died here. I don't know how far the fishermen go, but compared to us, we went further than them. We sailed for around 3 hours. I think Yamada said that if we went further for another 3 hours, we could—...."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Wait wait wait… What did you say? We sailed for 3 hours?!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Yes of course it was 3 hours! That was why I felt sick. How long did you think we were there, seriously."</p><p align="left">"I saw my watch and it was only 1 hour since we left!!!!!" It was Kochi's turn to be shocked because of Hokuto.</p><p align="left">"Are you kidding me?!!! We sailed for 3 hours, Hokuto!! And it became 6 hours in total!!! That's why the doctor said that you're so lucky to be alive!!!"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto went blank after knowing another fact from Kochi. He was sure that his watch worked properly and he was sure that he saw it right. It was only one hour after they left the shore but why did Kochi say that they had left for 3 hours?</p><p align="left">There was something wrong with it.</p><hr/><p align="left">
<em>A week later after the story from Kochi.</em>
</p><p align="left">Hokuto leaned his back on his seat, swaying his body from side to side as his mind kept thinking the same thing all day. 2 weeks had passed since that incident. He wasn't thinking about it a lot when he was being hospitalized. But after Kochi told him a story while driving him home from the hospital, he couldn't stop thinking about it. He knew there was something wrong with it and he couldn't ignore it. He felt like he had to find the truth.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto stood up from his seat, walking away to check if Kochi was in his office or not. He just posted a new article about this place and the beauty of it. Yamada indeed told them that they have to postpone some projects but they agreed to keep promoting this place and the ocean. They asked some permission from the government and asked their favor to patrol around the ocean. Some of them had come back safely while the others were still there. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I think he isn't here." Hokuto mumbled to himself after checking the other room. He walked back to his seat, taking out his lunchbox and eating them as he was thinking about something.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was crazy enough after knowing all those things in these 2 weeks, but seemed like it could be crazier. Hokuto was sure he had lost his mind when he decided to go alone to check the place using a simple white boat with a machine on the back. He told Katori to tell Kochi that he had a business with the government for a moment. He felt bad for doing this but he promised he would stop if he couldn't find anything, "I promise I will be fine this time, Kochi."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He pushed the boat off the shore and drove it carefully. He was wearing a life vest and brought a flashlight, a wood, an ax and an anchor just in case it was needed. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It seemed like winter would come sooner. The weather was colder than yesterday, but the sky was bright. The sun kissed his skin with its light, transferring their warmth to him. The fluffy clouds scattered around the sky, as if they were hesitant to cover the earth but they didn't want to. Hokuto looked forward, he was planning to cover himself but it would be suspicious if someone saw him. So he decided to let himself as it's. He looked around and as he expected, some of his neighbors saw him and waved at him, asking him where he wanted to go alone around the sea. Of course Hokuto didn't tell the truth, he said that the police needed him so he had to go. He waved back and smiled brightly as he passed them. Bringing back his focus while wishing that the police wouldn't meet him at least for now.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He looked at his watch and it had been 2 hours since he left the shore. He made sure that the watch worked properly as he kept watching it for a few seconds. He moved to the back to check the machine's fuel, making sure that he had enough until he arrived at the shore.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Let's wait here."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes… </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He had been waiting for 30 minutes for nothing. If he thought about it, why did he have to check it? Why did he have to spend his precious time for nothing here? He was alone, there was no one here. Not even the fishermen. He was sure that he went far from them. But what for? What did he seeked? What was that making him curious? </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I shouldn't have done this… " he started regretting what he had done. He should have gone back now before the sun went down. He turned around the boat to go back, getting ready to leave but then something caught his attention.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The voice.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The voice calling him. It was the same voice as he heard 2 weeks ago, he was sure about it. But this time it sounded… softer… as if they had become weak. Hokuto could feel it. He could feel the voice showed yearning.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"No!! No I can't let myself do the same thing!!" Hokuto said as he took a pair of earbuds from his pocket and wore them before his mind started remembering those memories and made him dive again into the ocean (even though he had worn a life vest).</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">But he still could hear them. It still vibrated through his ears, touching him gently by its melody, making him sleepy. He tried his best to fight, he couldn't sleep here or something bad might happen. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to bring back his focus and ignored the voice, but it was useless. The slower he breathed, the sleepier he became.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Don't!! Please don't, Hokuto. You can't sleep here or you might die!!" He said firmly. But his body couldn't resist. He laid his back slowly on the boat, looking at the beautiful sky as he blinked slowly. Letting sleepiness embrace him tightly. He wished it wouldn't be the last time he saw nature and their beauty, and then, he closed his eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Taiga held the boat and brought it with him. He had been waiting all the time. He wanted to see Hokuto, and his time had come. He didn't want to let him go, at least for now. He promised he wouldn't hurt him, he would never do that. He just wanted to see him longer, but not here. He needed to bring him with him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga moved his tail fastly, bringing them swimming towards the east, far from his place and other sirens. He remembered he saw a cave around here when he was looking for prey a few years ago. He brought Hokuto with him to go there because it would be safer. He didn't think he would see any sirens there. The cave was still in the ocean and as far as Taiga remembered, he didn't think he ever caught or saw humans around there. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He pushed the boat to the right side inside the cave as it touched the sand, taking the anchor and dropping it down (Thanks to the sunken ship, taiga learned it from that). He moved his body with difficulty beside the boat and flipped it to the ground slowly. Hokuto landed with his whole left body on the ground, but Taiga turned Hokuto carefully until his back lay perfectly. He pushed the boat away from Hokuto so he had some space to watch him closer to his face. Taiga's tail moved side to side beautifully as he laid his chin on his hands, watching Hokuto's figure from his side. His skin was smooth, the tip of his nose was sharp and pretty, his thin lips opened slightly as he breathed slowly. Taiga found himself staring at Hokuto closely. So close until he could feel his own breath from Hokuto's cheeks. He raised his chest and hooked his arms on Hokuto's and brought him closer. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">But he just realized that Hokuto was wearing something on his body.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga knew this thing. He had been living for one hundred years and it would be shameful if he didnt know how to open this puffy orange thing (the life vest). Usually, Taiga just tore them apart with his sharp nails, but this time he wanted to be gentler. He didn't want to cause any scratch on Hokuto's. He looked at it for a moment, observing until he found there was a hook in the center. It wasn't easy for him to take it off. He almost tore them like he used to do but then he managed to open it accidentally. Taiga moved the puffy thing away from Hokuto's chest and saw how his chest moved up and down slowly, showing that he was breathing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga placed his right hand, cold and wet hand on Hokuto's chest, feeling his heartbeat while his eyes stared at his figure. He still remembered how Hokuto's heartbeat felt and how weak it was. But this time it felt different. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto's heart was beating normally, not too fast nor too slow. Taiga could feel he was… living.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He tilted his head when his eyes caught a black dot in the corner of Hokuto's lips. "What is it?" Taiga said softly, his index finger touched it a few times carefully, did not want to hurt him with his sharp nail.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It's… unique. I have never seen something like this before…" He said quietly while playing with the black dot on the corner of Hokuto's lips. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He placed his cold palm back on Hokuto's chest, wanting to feel more of his heartbeat as his mind was thinking about another thing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga swore he didn't know what was going on with him. Everything seemed confusing since he met Hokuto but he didn't want to think about it. He would let his instinct lead him. He pulled back his hand while caressing Hokuto's chest, and bringing his head down onto it slowly. Touching his own head, leaning down his cheeks on Hokuto's chest as he felt his heartbeat vibrate through his ears, letting the water drop from his hair onto Hokuto's chest one by one, wetting his clothes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Hmm?" Taiga mumbled to himself, "it's weird… " he continued. He could feel it was beating faster and harder this time. Taiga even felt it in his cheeks.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">
<em>How come? Eh? This thing could happen? How?</em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He knew the heart could beat faster, it happened to him too but only when he was catching his prey, the adrenaline he felt when he was hunting. But he didn't know that a human's heart could beat faster because of nothing. How come?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga raised his head slowly, letting his eyes wander on Hokuto's figure one more time and closer, blowing his own breath on Hokuto's chin.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He was going to touch Hokuto's lips but then another hand caught him and surprised him. His eyes widened when he saw Hokuto had woken up, staring at him with a look that was no less surprised than him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Who are you?" Hokuto asked. He realized he had been holding the other's hand as he kept his eyes on him, staring at him confusedly. Hokuto tightened his grip as he woke his body up, trying to push the distance between them but the other one brought his body away from Hokuto until he sat on the ground. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto kept his eyes on Taiga's. The dazzling green eyes staring at him in confusion, surprise, and a little bit of worry. The same eyes that he saw under the ocean before pulling him into his embrace. Those eyes were alluring as if it could hypnotize anyone that looked into them. Hokuto didn't realize he had been staring a lot at Taiga and probably Hokuto scared him as he tried to let his hand off him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Wait, I just want to ask you some questions."</p><p align="left">"I won't hurt you, I promise." Hokuto said softly. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga knew Hokuto wouldn't do that, his instinct told him so, but he was just surprised. He didn't know when Hokuto had woken up. Did he know that Taiga was listening to his heartbeat? Or did he wake Hokuto up when he leaned his head on his chest?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga swallowed hard as he tried to be calm in front of someone that was supposed to be his prey.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It was your voice that I heard two weeks ago, wasn't it?" Hokuto asked softly while looking at the half mermaid and half man in front of him (he was sure this figure was a man because he didn't see any boobs when he took a quick glance at him). It took a few moments until he saw him nodded. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"And you're the one who made me sleep here?"</p><p align="left">Taiga nodded again, his face was still straight but his eyes told everything. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"But you're also the one who saved me 2 weeks ago?" Hokuto asked the last question softly, tightening his grip on Taiga's webbed hand.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga nodded again and averted his eyes. He didn't want to see Hokuto's reaction. He didn't know why he was suddenly scared of what others thought about him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Thank you… " Hokuto spoke softly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Thank you for saving my life… " Hokuto looked at him with a warm smile. "I was thinking about death for a few moments, but then you pulled me into your embrace. And I changed my mind…" Hokuto lowered his head but kept his smile on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I was scared… I was really scared of death and when I was thinking and wishing I could get another chance to be alive, you saved me."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It was difficult for you, wasn't it? Swimming from the middle of the ocean to the shore while holding a big human like me." Hokuto raised his head and looked at Taiga, letting out a chuckle as he found it was kind of funny.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Thank you… " Hokuto spoke softly. Taiga kept his face straight as his eyes locked on Hokuto's. He was completely confused by those eyes, but this time he understood. Hokuto was scared to death, wishing himself to be alive, crying because of frustration, and asked for Taiga's help. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga understood it now.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"What's your name?" Hokuto asked after a while, making Taiga surprised <em>again</em>. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It was safe for him to talk above the ground, right? He remembered Juri ever told him that sirens couldn't sing above the ground, but Taiga didn't know he could speak normally or not. But he wanted to try. At least he could make sure that he wouldn't hurt Hokuto by his singing. He really wanted to tell him his name but he didn't know why he couldn't let his voice out. His lips become dry, his words stuck on his throat. Taiga blinked repeatedly as he tried his best to speak.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"K… Kyo-..."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Hmm?" Hokuto tilted his head as he waited for Taiga to speak, taking off his earbuds fastly. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Kyo… Kyomoto… T-... Taiga… " He said quietly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Kyomoto Taiga?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga nodded. His face was still straight but Hokuto could see his eyes were telling something, and Hokuto replied by smiling warmly at him.</p><p align="left">"Can I call you Taiga?" Hokuto asked softly. Taiga nodded as he kept his face straight <em>again</em>. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">They were sitting on the sand inside the cave for a few moments, letting the waves sound filled their ears and the wind blowing towards them. When he found Taiga wasn't looking at him, Hokuto stole this chance to admire the figure in front of him. His eyes were busily wandering around Taiga. His tail was glistening like an emerald. Taiga had thin yet wide flukes like a whale and it was the same color as his pelvic fins which were dark green, like everything looked perfectly with his emerald tail. There was a sharp part like a sword in the notch of his flukes, Hokuto assumed this siren used it to stab the victims.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto turned his eyes on Taiga's face.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">No wonder he felt like he was touching scales. Taiga's cheeks felt rough yet soft when Hokuto touched it. The scales laid beautifully and perfectly on his cheekbones to under his eyes, covering half of his cheeks, making him look marvelous. His damp black long hair (that reached his neck) glimmering because of the sunlight behind him, making him look glamorous. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Never once he thought that he would meet a Greek mythology creature, a siren. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Most precisely, the most beautiful creature he had ever seen.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He couldn't deny he was scared at first, but Taiga looked gorgeous.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga looked... amazing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Hokuto almost forgot how to breathe, but then he realized that he had been caught up with those dazzling eyes, staring at him as if he wanted to attack him. But instead of stopping, Hokuto smiled gently at him, touching his scales slowly as his eyes wandered on Taiga's face. He gently touched Taiga's small lips that slightly opened using his thumb.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"You're so beautiful..." Hokuto said before he looked at those dazzling eyes. He didn't know if it was the water in Taiga's eyes that made them twinkle or because of his touch. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The next thing Hokuto knew was that he had pressed his own lips on his, feeling the saltiness and the softness of Taiga's lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga was stunned when he felt Hokuto's lips on his. Feeling his breath on his nose, seeing how close they were. He couldn't even blink when Hokuto broke their lips, locking his eyes on him and smiling softly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">What was it?</p><p align="left">What was something touching his chest?</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">It happened when he saw Hokuto's eyes two weeks ago, but it caused a little bit of pain. But this time, it was different. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">He felt different. He felt like something was tickling inside him. It was more like… a vibration. A vibration within him and flowing in his blood, making him dizzy. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">When Taiga was still busy processing his other confusion, he was given another surprise as Hokuto pressed his lips on his own again. If the first one Taiga could only feel the lips, this one he could feel Hokuto's tongue on his lips, trying to push it and open it forcibly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">As if reality hit him hard, Hokuto broke his kiss, placing his own palm over his lips and his eyes widened in surprise as if he couldn't believe what he had done to Taiga. He didn't have the guts to look at those eyes as he was in a hurry, hooking his life vest on his body, pushing his boat off the ground, and getting into it. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I… I would love to meet you again here… " Hokuto said before he drove his boat leaving the cave. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Taiga watched Hokuto's back away from him while placing his own hand on his chest, feeling his heart was beating faster. Meanwhile the other hand pushed his own lips, remembering how Hokuto's lips tasted on his.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"So soft… "</p>

<p>"You're so dumb <em>fucking</em> idiot, Matsumura Hokuto." Hokuto couldn't stop cursing himself alone while sailing in the middle of the sea. The sound of waves filled his ears, the yellowish red rays from the sun began to refract around him. The wind was blowing hard towards him, making him shiver as he took the scarf under his seat. It had been two hours since he left Taiga after kissing him <em>unconsciously</em>. He still remembered, after realizing what he had done, Hokuto pulled himself back and looked away from Taiga. He didn't have any guts to see his eyes and just left him in a hurry instead of explaining. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let himself got lost in his reverie as his mind was repeating the same moment that happened a few hours ago, a shocking moment if he could say. He knew that it was the same thing that made him fall into the ocean weeks ago, and he still failed to fight its voice and fell asleep. Before he lost his consciousness completely, he had a feeling that it might not be human. Well, at least he believed a human couldn't hypnotize him and make him sleep or jump into the ocean. But no matter what would happen later, he just hoped he could prove it. </p><p> </p><p>As God granted his wish, he woke up. He knew he got pushed to enter a cave, and he managed to hide himself by pretending to sleep when Taiga dropped him from the boat, opening the hook of the life vest on his chest, and placing his cold and wet palm onto it. Hokuto managed to stay calm and let Taiga observe him even though it was really difficult for him not to move, especially when he could feel Taiga's breath on his chin when he touched and played with his mole.</p><p> </p><p>But he failed to stay calm when Taiga leaned his head onto his chest, feeling his heartbeat, letting the water drop from Taiga's hair wetting his clothes. He was sure Taiga could hear how loud his heartbeat was. It was so damn loud. He really thought he might explode if Taiga did more to him so he grabbed his hand, pretending that he just woke up. For a few seconds, Hokuto really thought that it was a girl. Guessing by how pretty the hands were, how beautiful the voice was, and how pretty his face was when Hokuto slightly saw him. But no, he wasn't a girl.</p><p> </p><p>He was a man, clearly a half man with a glimmering emerald tail. Honestly it was difficult for Hokuto to believe that Taiga was a siren. He had heard about it from his father when he was young. He believed it back then, but when he was getting older, it became unbelievable for him.</p><p> </p><p>But here he was, meeting Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't even realize that he had been staring at him for a few moments and probably scared him. Hokuto didn't even realize what he had said to Taiga when he found out that Taiga was his savior. Hokuto did think that Taiga might have wanted to kill him, but the fact that he saved him stayed in his mind. He couldn't stop thinking about it. Even thanking him was not enough.</p><p> </p><p>"But it doesn't mean you have to kiss him, idiot!!" He murmured to himself again and let out a long sigh. Indeed he was like an idiot for kissing a siren that he just met for less than 30 minutes.</p><p> </p><p>But at the same time, it was real.</p><p> </p><p>The beauty of Taiga, the glimmering emerald tail that amazed him, the sharpen eyes that hypnotized him, the cute webbed hands, the scales around his cheeks that made him looked marvelous, the small and pretty lips that wet, yet soft when Hokuto crashed his lips to Taiga's, and the fangs that made Hokuto realize who he had kissed and brought him back to reality. </p><p> </p><p>Moreover, everything he felt about Taiga was real. Hokuto's throbbing heart, his increased pulse when Taiga stared at him, and the heat inside him when they kissed. </p><p> </p><p>Everything was real.</p><p> </p><p>"How could that be possible… " Hokuto spoke quietly while staring at his feet as he thought about Taiga, comparing him and himself unintentionally.</p><p> </p><p>Was he just being impulsive because he got too carried away by his feelings and then he kissed Taiga? Or was it really because of Taiga's ethereal beauty, or he just… fell in love with him?</p><p> </p><p>Nah. It wouldn't be love. It was too fast if he called it love. It might be because of Taiga's beauty. He might just be surprised after knowing that Taiga saved him and he got too carried away by his own feelings. The atmosphere around also gave an impact for those kisses. </p><p> </p><p>"Right, I can't possibly fall in love with him. I just need to stop meeting him and everything will be back to normal." Hokuto tried to convince himself. </p><p> </p><p>But he just made a promise, an indirect promise that he would love to meet Taiga again, but how could he face him later? </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let out a long sigh again and again, emptying his lungs from the heavy feelings inside him. He then looked up, realizing that around him was getting dark, there weren't any yellowish red rays anymore, only the navy blue sky and the moon shone beautifully above him. Hokuto also found out that he was getting closer to the shore. </p><p> </p><p>Let's forget Taiga for a while, he had to arrive at his house and make some excuses if Kochi asked him where he had been. </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>"Where have you been?" Remi asked calmly after seeing Taiga swimming down in the middle of the night. Taiga stayed in the cave above for hours. He was overwhelmed because of Hokuto. He was still a bit overwhelmed by his action, though. That was the reason he didn't even realize how Remi and Juri stared at him, showering him with a lot of questions. Of course they would suspect him. Taiga had been doing this everyday and tonight he had been away for hours and came back without anything. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't have to answer your question, do I?" Taiga replied coldly, throwing a glare with his cold eyes at them, cold enough to shut them for a while. </p><p> </p><p>"Yae said she saw you swimming towards someone. I assumed you went hunting," Remi tilted her head and crossed her arms, "but I don't see your food, nor even smell any blood." She raised her eyebrows and stared suspiciously at Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga let out a sharp breath through his nose. He was completely annoyed by Remi. He didn't have any energy to argue with her. So he only turned his face away from them, swimming and leaving them. But then Remi stopped him with her words. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you want King Jesse to hear about it?" Remi asked in a challenging tone. Taiga clenched his hand into a fist and turned his body at Remi, stared sharply at her as he swam slowly towards her. </p><p> </p><p>"What? You want to tell him? What do you want to say? <em>'Kyomoto Taiga has been acting strangely for days and Yae saw him swimming towards someone, maybe he wanted to kill a human but I don't see any flesh or smell any blood on him'</em> that is what you want to tell? Do you have any proof? Are you sure King Jesse will believe you? You haven't forgotten that<em> I am his favorite</em>, have you?" Taiga spoke deeply and fastly as if he forgot to take a breath. He brought his face closer to Remi and glared at her, scaring her.</p><p> </p><p>"Try it, and you will see." Taiga spoke deeply but putting a lot of pressure on his voice, indirectly threatening Remi with his words. He moved his tail to push himself away from Remi and glared at Juri who looked frowning at him. Taiga really thought Juri might be the one who came up with this <em>stupid</em> idea. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam further inside his cave, hiding behind the rock as he laid down, not wanting to move even for an inch as he knew Juri was still there, staring at his cave, wanting to be noticed. </p><p> </p><p>"Fuck off!" Taiga murmured to himself as he closed his eyes, placing his own hand over his face as he tried to shut down his brain and to calm his heartbeat. Not because of what Remi said to him about King Jesse, but because of Hokuto. It had been hours, but he still couldn't calm after what Hokuto did to him. He couldn't stop thinking about him and his heart couldn't stop pounding hard.</p><p> </p><p>Let's forget about Hokuto for now (as if he could do this), he needed to rest or he might explode from the strong heartbeat. </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his glimmering tail up and down slowly, swimming towards his place while his mind was wondering about food. The waves underwater felt strong and the sky seemed dark. There wasn't any light shone between the blue water. It had been weeks since the last time he ate human's flesh and Taiga had forgotten how it tasted. As he arrived, he looked around and screened the ground to see if there was any flesh or blood left for him. He moved his tail side by side, his hair flying beautifully as he searched behind the rock and around his storage to find any cup of blood from the last prey of a human that he killed. But he found nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Of course there was nothing left. He even forgot when was the last time he hunted properly.</p><p> </p><p>"I was supposed to catch Hokuto but things changed suddenly and look at me now… " Taiga sighed as he leaned his back on the rock, staring blankly at the ground as he thought about food, a delicious food that could feed his rumbling stomach. </p><p> </p><p>"Maybe a shark will be good."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his tail and swam outside his cave, wandering around to find a new prey. A smirk formed on his lips when he spotted a shark (in the same size as him) swimming in front of him. He hid inside the trench for a moment, waiting for the right time to stab it. As he found the shark catched another prey, Taiga pushed himself and moved his tail fastly. He flipped his body and pointed his sharp fin at the shark and thrust it a few times, letting its blood spread around the cold water and then dragging the shark to his place.</p><p> </p><p>As he arrived, Taiga threw the shark to the side of the cave, taking a seat beside it and tearing its skin until he could taste its meat. </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't expect that a shark could taste like this." said him while chewing the food, letting a bit of sweet taste flow down his throat. Taiga was starving, he didn't even realize that he had eaten half of the shark and flipped it to finish the other side. He ate them peacefully, throwing the shark's head and its bonds and scattered them around him, licking his fingers to enjoy the last taste. </p><p> </p><p>He thought he would be full after finishing a big shark in one sitting, but no. Well, his stomach was full but there was something else that felt empty. </p><p> </p><p>Nah, not something again. It was clear enough.</p><p> </p><p>He was thinking about Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>What was Hokuto doing? Did he arrive at the shore safely after leaving him in the cave? Did he really come to visit him again when he wasn't there? Taiga wanted to see him in the same place as before, but the other sirens were still around. It seemed like the rumor about him having a fight with Juri and Remi spread faster. He couldn't even go away from his place as one or two sirens kept watching him from afar.</p><p> </p><p>This happened a few times, sometimes they watched him to learn how Taiga killed his prey, and he didn't mind it. But this time it was different.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't want other sirens to find out about Hokuto, so he had to stay closer to his own cave. </p><p> </p><p>"Kyomo!!"</p><p> </p><p>Juri's voice echoed around and distracted him from his thoughts. Taiga wanted to stay in his place, but he had to act normally so the others wouldn't suspect him again. If it worked, he could go away to see Hokuto again. </p><p> </p><p>Juri told him that he just catched a prey, a good prey he said and he offered Taiga to have some, knowing that Taiga didn't go hunting (for humans) for no specific reasons. Taiga only looked at the victim with a vertical line formed between his brows, staring at a half body of a swollen human that laid down on a flat rock inside the sunken ship. Taiga kept staring at their figure as if he was observing them. </p><p> </p><p>"Do you wanna try?" Juri asked softly. Taiga still didn't turn his eyes off them while thinking. He didn't find this prey good. The human looked so fresh, indeed. He could smell its good scent from its blood around. But he didn't want to eat it.</p><p> </p><p>It was odd, wasn't it? He was searching for any blood in his storage an hour ago but then when he saw a good prey in front of his eyes, he had no interest in eating them.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't want it?" Juri asked, tilting his head to meet Taiga's eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"No, I'm not hungry." He answered. He wasn't lying when he said it, he just didn't say the next words that he lost his appetite when he saw humans. Well, Juri didn't have to know the reason, did he? Because he might spill everything to Remi again. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure? I don't think I've seen you eat anything for weeks…"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam away from the human and took a seat beside the window, staring at nothing outside, ignoring what Juri said to him. Juri (who had followed Taiga) turned Taiga's body gently and looked at him, making Taiga surprised as his eyes widened.</p><p> </p><p>"What's going on?" He asked softly. Rather than answer, Taiga kept his eyes rounded, staring at Juri as something crossed his mind. He blinked a few times as he brought his face closer to Juri, bit by bit, until Juri noticed it. </p><p> </p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga even grabbed Juri's hand and placed it over his scales on his cheeks to see if something happened to him, but nothing. He locked his eyes on Juri, bringing their faces closer and closer again until he felt his own breath in front of Juri's face, but still nothing. Nothing happened. Taiga didn't feel anything, not the vibration nor the increased heartbeat. Just nothing.</p><p> </p><p>"That's weird." Taiga mumbled to himself after pulling himself away from Juri, "why's your face becoming red?" Taiga asked, his brows furrowed as he felt annoyed. Juri turned his face away from him and stuttered, "y…yo-you're the one who's weird here. Why did you stare at me like that?" Juri asked, trying to hide his flushed cheeks in front of Taiga. He took a glance at him and saw what Taiga's face looked like.</p><p> </p><p>"You're thinking again, aren't you?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept his face straight as he looked at Juri, "I was just checking something." He said calmly.</p><p> </p><p>"What's that?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga still didn't want to spill this thing to Juri, but thinking about Hokuto only made his head spin.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Juri would keep this for him alone. Taiga wanted to believe it wouldn't be a bad idea. As Taiga knew, Juri used to get closer with anyone, women sirens, girl sirens, everyone. Maybe Juri could help him to figure this vibration inside him. But he still needed to be careful not to oversharing.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you kissed?" Taiga asked while keeping his face down, didn't want Juri to see him talking about it.</p><p> </p><p>"Hmm? Why suddenly?" Juri replied, looking at his friend in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>"Have you?" Taiga changed his tone, sounded colder and glanced at Juri, making the other freeze in his place.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, of course I have, a few times with… them…" Juri pointed at some girl sirens outside that swam together around the sunken ship, telling Taiga how many girls he had dated. </p><p> </p><p>"Did you feel something?"</p><p> </p><p>"Like… something tickling inside you and making you confused or… just anything?" Taiga turned his face away slowly while saying his words, not wanting to know how Juri would react to his questions.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga didn't hear anything, so he took a glance for a few seconds and saw Juri's brows furrowed while his mouth hanging loosely. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't get what you mean." Juri said after a while, still staring confused at him. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept his face straight without giving any further explanation. If Juri didn't get it, then it's fine.</p><p> </p><p>"Well, I just feel like it's good, it makes me happy and comfortable. But it never confuses me. I mean, that's normal, isn't it? We need to find a mate for us so we can be happy and reproduce offspring. You know, to keep our population. Just like what humans or other creatures do."</p><p> </p><p>Juri's answer actually didn't help. Taiga got what he meant for those things, finding a mate and reproducing offspring, Taiga knew about that. He just had zero interest in doing those things. </p><p> </p><p>There was another thing that Taiga hadn't understood yet. </p><p> </p><p>The touch, the lips, the cute black dot close to the lips that he wanted to touch more and more, the tingling inside his stomach, the vibration in his chest, the sparkling eyes that stared at him deeply and made him hold his breath without him realizing. </p><p> </p><p>The kiss.</p><p> </p><p>… and Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>See? Hokuto, Hokuto, and Hokuto again. Always Hokuto. Why couldn't Taiga stop thinking about him? It had been days, even weeks, since the last time he met him. Did Hokuto really make him curious? Or was it because of what Hokuto did to him? The softened eyes that looked at him deeply, the fast heartbeat of Hokuto when he touched it, and the kiss…</p><p> </p><p>Why did Hokuto kiss him after telling him that he was beautiful? What did Hokuto mean? What did he imply? And why did Taiga feel the vibration inside his chest? Not a usual vibration but it was strong, it was hard, he could feel his own heartbeat increase when Hokuto touched his lips with his. How? Hokuto's heart was also beating harder when Taiga leaned his head onto it. How could it be? </p><p> </p><p>Also, why did Taiga care so much about it? Why did he have to spend his time thinking a lot about Hokuto?</p><p> </p><p>…Well, he never wanted to, it was like Hokuto was staying in his mind all the time and Taiga didn't know how to drag him out. And Taiga never cared what other sirens thought about him, why did he have to care about what Hokuto thought about him? </p><p> </p><p>"See? You're thinking again." Juri's voice brought him back from his thoughts. Taiga took a glance at Juri for the last time and clucked his tongue before leaving him alone in the sunken ship.</p><p> </p><p>The waves felt calm, the fish were still swimming around, catching their prey, and the others were hiding behind the corals and playing around with each other. Taiga leaned his chin over his hands, laying down his chest on the ground on the narrow cave mouth, staring blankly at nothing as he got lost in his reverie. He blew softly the air through his lips, watching the bubble that formed because of it. Seeing a jellyfish with orange pearls color swim closer to him, as if knowing that he felt lonely.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to see Hokuto… " he whispered to one of them, touching the bell of a jellyfish as he leaned his head over his hand, "do you think I can see him again?" he continued. He placed his own thumbs over his lips, pushing it gently as he remembered Hokuto's lips on his. His body suddenly couldn't feel how cold the water was as he felt something strange iver his body, his heart started beating faster again as he caressed his lips. Without him realizing, he opened his own lips, pushing his thumb gently as he imagined how soft and warm Hokuto's tongue was. But he stopped when his thumb touched his fangs, bringing him back from his reverie.</p><p> </p><p>"Was it because of my fangs?" Taiga said quietly. For some reason that he hadn't known yet, he felt his heart sting a bit. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked a few times as he raised his head. He brought his eyes to look around and realized that those fish were swimming away fastly. Taiga raised his body up and pushed his body to swim slowly, looking for where the fish were going. </p><p> </p><p>"Where are they?" He mumbled alone while turning his head side by side, and he saw those fish were hiding behind the rock. Taiga looked around to find the reason they were hiding, and then he saw a shadow above him. He flipped his body to look at it and he found a couple of whales swimming above him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>Wait, a couple of whales?</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He remembered the first time he met Hokuto was because of the whale. What if he would meet him again this time? Taiga closed his eyes as he sharpened his ears, trying to hear any sounds from many kilometers away from him.</p><p> </p><p>He heard laughter… of children. Boys played around, women's voices called some children's names, and men's voices, loud and big laughter.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hokuto!!! Come here!! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga opened his eyes as he heard someone's voice calling Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>He would definitely meet Hokuto, it must be him. Taiga had to go up. He looked around and saw there were no sirens around him, then he swam fastly, getting closer to the whales and hiding between them. Taiga swam following them until he could hear the voice of a ship around him. </p><p> </p><p>The ray of the sun greeted him between the surface of water, the waves became stronger because of the machine. The whales were swimming up slowly, probably wanting to greet humans up there and entertain them. Taiga's eyes widened as he saw someone he knew was hiding in the dark, getting ready to attack the ship above.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Yae! </em>
</p><p>Taiga was too caught up by the ship earlier, he didn't realize that a jellyfish had been following him, swimming closer to him until it met his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"You have been following me?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head as he thought about something else. "Alright, can you please help me to check if she's alone or if she has someone around her?" The jellyfish swam as fast as it could towards Yae to do what Taiga said. As the whales separated and swam away from him, Taiga pushed his tail and swam fastly to hide into the darkness.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't take long as he saw a jellyfish had come back towards him.</p><p> </p><p>"Is she alone?" he whispered, the jellyfish moving its bell, answering Taiga's question.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, thank you. You better stay here or go back to the cave. It might be dangerous." He gave a nod before leaving it behind, swimming quietly in the darkness towards Yae. His eyes radiated green light as he glared at her back when he stood behind her, taking a piece of leaf that he knew as a poison to give it to her. No no, it wasn't that dangerous. It would make her unconscious for…. maybe an hour if she bites it. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga moved his tail up and down fastly, but still quietly. So quiet that Yae didn't even notice until he managed to cover her mouth with his hand and a poisoned leaf over it. Taiga pushed its leaf inside her mouth. She struggled to look at him but her body became weaker. Taiga really thought it was because of him but then he saw a jellyfish move its bell and got closer to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! You attacked her?" Taiga asked, a very slight smirk formed on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, I will give you delicious food someday." He continued, patting the jellyfish's bell gently before swimming away to the surface. Taiga swam towards the whales fastly and stayed under the ship, hiding himself perfectly and following their move. </p><p> </p><p>He swam beautifully while moving his tail side by side as he looked at the ship, ignoring how loud the machine and how strong the waves were. He just wanted to try to find Hokuto's figure. He could hear how loud the crowd was up there after seeing a couple of whales jumping and showing their beauty flukes, letting out their voices as they tried to communicate with humans. Taiga scoffed, "My voice sounds so much better if you want to know," and a smirk formed on his lips. But then he shook his head, washing away any thoughts of showing off his skill as he remembered there was Hokuto up there. Indeed he really wanted to meet him, but not in this way. Not again. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept swimming together with the whales while hiding under the ship a few times, worrying there might be any humans seeing him. He kept his eyes sharp, being alarmed of any sirens around. He could see how the sky was bright up there as the sunlight penetrated the blue water, making his tail sparkling under its light. He didn't know how long he had been swimming with the whales, perhaps in an hour as he heard a man speak with his loud voice on the ship.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Alright it's time to say goodbye to Pearl and Jimmy!!"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"They named them?" Taiga spoke to himself while raising one of his brows. He moved a bit under the ship as he saw the whales coming down after showing their flukes for the last time, making those humans excited then bid them goodbye. Taiga thought that a couple of whales would leave him and go back to their places, but he saw one of them stopped and swam towards him.</p><p> </p><p>How surprised Taiga was when he heard the whale speak to him, telling him that someone had been waiting for him so he had to meet him soon.</p><p> </p><p>"Did he tell you this?" Taiga asked, feeling unsure of what the whale told him.</p><p> </p><p>His heart beating faster as he heard the next thing from the whale. He bit his bottom lip as he held his throbbing heart, bidding them goodbye and swimming as fast as he could towards the cave.</p><p> </p><p>The same cave where he and Hokuto kissed for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>He waited for him in the cave, hoping that he would see Hokuto's figure or perhaps hear his small boat or his voice calling him. But he didn't see any boats crossing or hear Hokuto's voice around. Taiga started to think that the whale just wanted to fool him by making him wait for hours. He clenched his webbed hand into a fist, gritting his teeth as he held the sting inside his heart. He was ready to go back to his place as he dragged himself back to the water, but then he heard a machine boat getting closer.</p><p> </p><p>He turned his face and let his eyes wander around to find the boat. And his eyes widened as he saw Hokuto come towards him, waving his hand and calling his name out loud. Taiga dragged his body back to the sand and took a seat beautifully, watching Hokuto getting closer to him. He placed his own palm on his chest and felt how loud his heartbeat was. He swallowed hard and blinked fastly as he tried to calm down when he saw Hokuto walk towards him while panting. </p><p> </p><p>"Hi… " Hokuto said while holding a box and smiling shyly at him. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga (tried to) keep his face straight as he gritted his teeth, letting Hokuto take a seat beside him and placed the box on his own lap. Hokuto lowered his head, biting his bottom lips while occasionally stealing glances at Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept his eyes on Hokuto's side profile, admiring how beautiful his tip of nose was and how sharp his jawline was. Hokuto looked tired. His black curly hair looked damp, his forehead covered with sweat or maybe it was the sea water, Taiga wasn't sure. He swallowed hard as he saw Hokuto scratched his own neck, looking hesitant. </p><p> </p><p>"This is so awkward… " Hokuto mumbled to himself. He looked up and turned his face towards Taiga and met his sight. Taiga's round eyes sparkling with his scales, making him look more beautiful. Hokuto forgot he had been holding his breath again. He looked away and blinked repeatedly, trying to go back to reality. </p><p> </p><p>"Ummm… " </p><p> </p><p>"Ah… I- I brought you a lunchbox. I'm not sure if you would like it or not, but… well, would you try?" He tried to break the ice between them by handing Taiga a lunchbox hesitantly without looking at him. Taiga blinked and took its box and opened it. His brows frowning as he spotted a meat with some green leaf and pale yellow small stem beside it. He sniffed it while looking confused. </p><p> </p><p>"That is french fries," Hokuto said while looking at one stick of french fries in Taiga's finger, "made from potato."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was hesitant at first but decided to have a bite of it. A vertical line between his brows was gone when he chewed it. The crunchy texture and a sweet from its food made his eyes rounded in appreciation. He took more french fries again and again until nothing was left.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled softly while watching Taiga eating heartily. "Oh! That is the main dish, a steak. Made from beef." Hokuto said as he saw Taiga stared at the meat, as if he knew Taiga's mind.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga grabbed its meat on his full hand, staring at it for a while as he saw the brown liquid dripping onto his tail. He sniffed the meat and his eyes widened in surprise as he smelled a strong flavor come from its meat. He turned to Hokuto while frowning, he wasn't sure if he had to try this, but Hokuto smiled softly at him as if telling him that it would be okay.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a bite of the meat on his hand slowly, chewing it while closing his eyes as he imagined a bitter taste of it. But then his eyes widened in appreciation, his cheeks slightly bloomed in happiness as he kept eating the meat with gusto, ignoring how messy the sauce was over his mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let out a chuckle before he took a paper of tissue, moving closer to Taiga to wipe his lips. As Hokuto's hand touched his lips, Taiga couldn't move at all. Hokuto's touch felt different on his lips and Taiga felt the same vibration again on his chest. He even forgot the delicious taste of food in his mouth as his eyes locked on Hokuto, staring at him deeply as he saw his own reflection on Hokuto's sparkling eyes. </p><p> </p><p>"Taiga… " Hokuto called him softly. Taiga kept his mouth hanging loosely as he watched Hokuto lowering his hand, clenching a tissue paper on his hand as he looked at Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you eat humans?"</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<em>A few days after Hokuto kissed Taiga.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The night autumn wind blew into Hokuto's window, opening its curtain and entering his house. Hokuto walked into his room and placed a cup of tea on his desk. He walked towards the window and looked outside, happily letting the night wind touch his face. The ticking sound of the clock hanging on its wall filled the room, killing the emptiness inside. Hokuto looked up, feasting his eyes on the half beautiful moon surrounded by stars and making the sky sparkling above him. Being alone in his room and fascinated by the beautiful nature around only made Hokuto get carried away. A thin smile etched on his lips as something crossed his mind. </p><p> </p><p>Just a month ago he was still sometimes thinking about his past, about someone that used to live here with him and being alone only made him fall into his sentimental self. </p><p> </p><p>But tonight, he realized he never thought about that anymore. Maybe he had already moved on completely. Maybe he had forgiven himself and accepted everything. </p><p> </p><p>Or maybe his mind had completely diverted to someone else.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>What was he doing? Was he fine? Did he come to see him again in that place? Or did he just forget about him by ignoring everything that he said to him and what he had done to him. </p><p> </p><p>… Did he hurt him for leaving him in that way?</p><p> </p><p>But he told Taiga that he would love to meet him again even though he was still unsure about it.</p><p> </p><p>The night breeze blew his hair and brushed his bangs gently. Hokuto blinked a few times as he brought his finger to his lips, trying to remember how soft Taiga's lips were on his, how wet it was, and how it tasted like seasalt.</p><p> </p><p>His finger stopped as his mind wandered about something else. What did Taiga think about lips? </p><p> </p><p>Did he like it?</p><p> </p><p>Did he like the kiss? Did he want more? </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto slapped his cheeks to bring himself back to reality, "How dare you, Hokuto!!!" He shook his head to wash away any thoughts about Taiga's lips. He took the tea and drank it slowly, letting the sweet and the warmth of it enter his throat. He placed the cup back on its plate, turning his face towards the outside to satisfy him by its beauty for the last, before he closed the window, cleaning himself and walking back to his bed to get some sleep.</p><p> </p><p>As he thought he could sleep, his body kept turning side by side, looking for any comfortable position but he couldn't. His mind couldn't stop thinking about Taiga. There was something else that still bothered him. Hokuto woke his body up, taking his laptop and turning it on, letting the blue lights from its screen shine towards him. He looked up to see the clock hanging on the wall in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>12.46 pm. It was already late for him, who used to sleep around 10. Even Kochi might have slept as well in this hour. </p><p> </p><p>As the white screen popped up, he clicked Google Icon in the corner of its screen and typed fastly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>What is Siren?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let his eyes focus on the screen as he read some articles about sirens, starting from <em>"what is a siren, where they come from, are they real, until where they live".</em> There were so many results about it and Hokuto found what he had been looking for.</p><p> </p><p>"Why does Siren kill humans?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes widened in surprise as he read the full article. He couldn't stop thinking about the incident that happened to him a few weeks ago. If sirens really eat humans, why did Taiga set him free? Why did he bother to carry him to the shore? Was he not interested in Hokuto after seeing him? And the last time when he brought him to the cave, why did he bother doing all those things to him? Those touching on his chest and his mole, did that all mean anything? Was he curious about him? Did he mean to save him so that he could kill him later?</p><p> </p><p>"But I don't think he wants to do that… " Hokuto's eyes softened as he stared at nothing. If Hokuto thought about it, he remembered how Taiga reacted to everything he did to him. The way he looked at him, and his dazzling eyes that spoke to him. Hokuto wasn't sure about it, he didn't want to assume everything based on what he saw. But, something inside him told him that Taiga would never kill hin. He saved his life once, why did he want to kill him later? He could just do that in their second meet, couldn't he? </p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto was too busy with his thoughts, Kochi opened his door and startled him, making Hokuto close his laptop suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing?" He asked, trying to be calm.</p><p> </p><p>"I was just checking you."</p><p> </p><p>"You act like my father. Thanks for that but you don't have to." Hokuto replied as he placed his laptop back on its desk.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi only looked at his friend in wonder, noticing how his friend acted strangely. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, did Yamada tell you that we will start watching whales this weekend?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto hummed as he pulled his blanket to his chest, "he told me."</p><p> </p><p>"Are you okay with that?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could tell Kochi was being concerned after what happened to him.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay, we will be okay." He replied, turning his back towards Kochi. As he heard a click sound from the door, Hokuto let a long sigh escape quietly before he closed his eyes and fell asleep. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>"Do you eat humans?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was shocked after hearing Hokuto's question. He didn't expect that Hokuto would directly throw him a question, <em>that kind</em> of question. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga swallowed the meat and lowered his head. Maybe it was his time to tell everything to Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>"I used to eat humans, but I don't do it anymore." Taiga said softly while tightening his grip on the box on his hands, "I don't eat human flesh anymore… "</p><p> </p><p>"Everything started after I met you."</p><p> </p><p>"I lost my appetite but I don't even know why. I don't have any desire even just for hunting humans." Taiga took a breath before he continued, "I stopped eating until I felt starving and I realized I have to eat something, so I decided to catch other fish around and have them as my food." Taiga kept lowering his head and made a thin line on his lips. He didn't know if Hokuto would believe him or not, and he didn't know why he really wanted Hokuto to believe him. But he didn't want to show that, he just didn't like begging. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed in relief through his nose as he loosened his tensed body, smiling softly at Taiga even though he didn't see it. He felt glad for believing that Taiga would never do that.. </p><p> </p><p>"So, how is it?" Hokuto asked and this time Taiga turned his face towards him, looking confused. "The steak, how is it? Do you like it?" he continued.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could only blink, he looked at the empty box in his hands, realizing that he had finished all the food. He was silent for a moment before giving an answer to Hokuto, "it's yummy… " he replied.</p><p> </p><p>"I like it." He spoke softly while turning his face at Hokuto, seeing how Hokuto's eyes softened while gazing back at him. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm so happy to hear that."</p><p> </p><p>The strong wind from the ocean blew towards them, filling their ears and brushing their hair, covering their sights from each other. Hokuto gulped as he saw how beautiful Taiga's features were when the wind blew towards him, making his black shiny hair fall and covering half of his face. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry for making you wait." Hokuto spoke softly while lowering his head.</p><p> </p><p>"I was blocked by work. We decided to continue our project on watching whales. I wanted to help them by gathering some people that were interested to have a small trip here and we managed to do it a few hours ago." Hokuto spoke calmly. He did think Taiga had the right to know even though he wasn't sure if Taiga waited for him or not (and a part of him believed that Taiga did wait). Also, Hokuto liked how Taiga listened as if he was completely paying attention to everything he said, so he kept going, telling him about his story. </p><p> </p><p>"I came with them because… maybe I would meet you again. But I didn't see you… " he said softly, turning his face and meeting Taiga's sight. Taiga's eyes sparkling, his hair danced gently in the wind. The sound of waves filled their ears as they looked into each other, gazing at the beauty in front of their eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto cleared his throat and averted his eyes, lowering his head as a soft breath escaped from his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"I tried to talk to one of those whales… " said Hikuto after a while. "I told them how much I miss you and how I really want to see you. I even told them about this cave, you know." Hokuto let out a single laugh softly while telling Taiga about his feelings. </p><p> </p><p>"And then you come." Hokuto turned his eyes to Taiga, feasting himself by locking his eyes with him. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto, once again letting his heart lead his body. He touched Taiga's hair and tucked it behind his ear, watching how Taiga's lips slightly opened as if he was surprised by Hokuto's action. They gazed into each other's eyes. Hokuto didn't hear anything but his loud pounding heart. The way Taiga looked at him, the way his eyes spoke to him, the way his lips opened slightly when he grew closer to him. His heart told him that Taiga might feel the same as him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga watched Hokuto's lips getting closer to his, feeling his hot breath in front of his lips.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>There it is.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could feel his stomach start getting tickled. He could feel his chest vibrate strongly. His heartbeat was increasing and he felt strange over his body. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't understand, he didn't understand any of this. He didn't understand why he felt like this. He didn't understand why his heartbeat increased when Hokuto grew closer to him. He didn't understand why he felt strange over his body. He didn't understand any vibration inside him, only when he was with Hokuto. He didn't understand why he thought about Hokuto a lot. He didn't understand why he wanted to know what Hokuto thought about him. He didn't understand why he wanted Hokuto to believe that he never ate any human anymore.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't understand. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's lips were only one inch from Taiga, but his movement stopped as Taiga threw him an unexpected question.</p><p> </p><p>"Why did you kiss me?" Taiga spoke in front of Hokuto's lips, making him stunned. Hokuto's ears flushed as Taiga looked into his eyes. Hokuto pulled himself back and turned his eyes away from Taiga as he worried that Taiga might hear his nearly exploded heart. He stuttered, he had no idea how to answer Taiga's question without blushing.</p><p> </p><p>So Hokuto decided to take another way by throwing him back an unexpected question.</p><p> </p><p>"D… didn't you… hate it?" He spoke softly, so soft that Taiga barely heard him. He dared himself to take a glance at Taiga and saw what kind of expression showed on Taiga's face.</p><p> </p><p>"Do… do you think I don't like it?" He asked, his brows furrowed in surprise by Hokuto's question.</p><p> </p><p>This time, it was Taiga's turn who was stuttering. His mouth slightly opened and closed a few times as he tried to collect his words, sorting everything that happened inside him.</p><p> </p><p>"I… I have been confused all this time. Since the first time we met, when I took you to the shore. Then our second meeting in this cave, and when you kissed me. Everything makes me confused."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto lowered his head and gulped, preparing himself if he had to face another pain.</p><p> </p><p>"The first time we met, I don't know what the thing inside me that made me wanted to save you. So I took you to the shore. And when I came back, I couldn't stop thinking about you. I was scared of what if other sirens caught you and killed you, or maybe what if you died alone because nobody saved you. What if I couldn't see you again? But then you came alone. And I wanted to spend more time with you, that's why I brought you to this cave."</p><p> </p><p>"And then you woke up, you talked to me. I wanted to hear more so I stayed. But then you touched me and kissed me... Those things made me felt like there was something tickling me inside and my heart was beating so fast. I felt something over my body and it was strange, I couldn't feel the cold even though I stayed in the cold place underwater. I was overwhelmed." Taiga took a deep breath as he felt the vibration getting stronger inside his chest. </p><p> </p><p>"I keep thinking about you all the time. I don't even go hunting, I let myself starve. I lost my appetite. I feel lonely and everything I want is just… I want to see you. I want to meet you, I want to figure everything out. About the vibration, about the increased heartbeat, and about your thoughts about me. I want— " Taiga stopped his words as he looked at Hokuto and saw how close their faces were. He could feel Hokuto's warm breath blowing gently to his lips.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled warmly as he felt the heat on his cheeks. He let his eyes wander on Taiga's ethereal beauty and landed his sight on his eyes, letting a soft laugh escape from his lips.</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't expect you're so innocent." He spoke gently. Taiga's brows furrowed as he didn't get what Hokuto meant. Didn't other sirens call him the greatest and the most sadistic siren? Why did Hokuto call him an innocent one?</p><p> </p><p>"So, do you like it? My lips… " Hokuto tilted his head to adjust his lips on Taiga, getting closer to him. </p><p> </p><p>"... I do… " Taiga whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to know about those things? Everything you feel after meeting me." Hokuto lifted his own chin to tease Taiga, but not close enough to kiss him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could feel his breath become unsteady, the adrenaline rushed inside him as if he was catching his prey, but he wasn't. It was just Hokuto and he wasn't a prey.</p><p> </p><p>"I will let you know after this." Hokuto crashed his lips on Taiga's and kissed him softly. He grabbed Taiga's cheek and tilted his head to the other side. Taiga was surprised by Hokuto's actions, but this time he decided to let everything flow. He closed his eyes, letting Hokuto do what he wanted to him. Feeling Hokuto's warm lips over him. Taiga's hand moved by itself, grabbing Hokuto's cheek and bringing their bodies closer. He just had let Hokuto open his lips and slid his tongue inside him, touching his fangs and reaching the back of his throat and making him let out a sound that he had never produced before. </p><p> </p><p>It was just a hum, but it sounded so beautiful from Taiga. The most beautiful sound that Hokuto ever heard, making his head spin and he had to break the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>"That is a moan." He spoke breathlessly in front of Taiga's lips. But before Taiga could ask, Hokuto attacked him again with another kiss and produced some sounds from their clashing teeth and their smooches, making Taiga's head spin in a good way. <em>A very good way</em> if Taiga could say.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto broke the kiss again as he took a deep breath, letting a string of saliva hang between their lips. </p><p> </p><p>"If you feel strange over your body, it's probably the heat that is caused because we're kissing." Hokuto crashed his lips again on Taiga and grabbed his neck, bringing their body closer. Their kisses were stable but fiercely. Hokuto could be sure that he never kissed someone like this before. He didn't even know that he could kiss someone this hungrily. The sweet and soft lips mixed in the taste of barbeque sauce over Taiga's mouth made their kisses felt good. Hokuto was too caught up by Taiga's lips that he didn't realize that Taiga had moved his own hand on his back and pushed Hokuto's body to get closer, so close that he could feel Taiga's throbbing heart on his chest. Taiga was just following what Hokuto did to him. Hokuto cupped Taiga's face with his hands and tilted his head to suck him deeper and deeper. Their ears full of each other moans and heavy breaths.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto broke the kiss again and wiped a single blood on his lips. </p><p> </p><p>"You're bleeding." Taiga whispered in front of his lips, but instead of answering. Hokuto smooched Taiga's lips with his again because he noticed how Taiga's eyes seemed to enjoy their kisses. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto broke the kiss and they opened their eyes slowly. He let his eyes wander over Taiga's face, gazing deeply as he cupped Taiga's cheeks. "Do you want to date me?" He asked softly while stroking Taiga's scales gently before he moved to Taiga's swollen and reddened lips. </p><p> </p><p>"If you can't stop thinking about me, feeling the vibration inside your chest whenever we're together, then…" Hokuto slightly opened his lips and averted his eyes for a while before he continued, "I'm not in the position to tell you about that. I am still not sure about it either. But the only thing that I can be sure of is, I feel the same as you. I can't stop thinking about you too. I feel lonely and I want to see you so badly…" Hokuto continued. He turned his eyes to Taiga, seeing his reflection on those dazzling green eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"Why don't we try to figure it out together?" </p><p> </p><p>"Figure it out… together?" Taiga spoke gently as he placed his hand over Hokuto's.</p><p> </p><p>"Together, a date, be my boyfriend…" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto wasn't lying if he wasn't sure about it. It was Taiga's feeling, he didn't want to convince Taiga by telling him that he might have been in love with him. On the other hand, he also wasn't sure if he was really in love with Taiga, or if everything was just a temporary feeling because it all happened too suddenly. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe time would help them to find their answer. </p><p> </p><p>But then if he thought about it, everything was clear. The reason he couldn't stop thinking about Taiga. The reason their heartbeat increased, the reason he blushed, the reason he wanted to tell him for just a small thing that happened to him in his life (even if they had more time, Hokuto would willingly tell everything to him). The reason they felt lonely. The reason he could believe that Taiga wouldn't hurt him, and the reason why Taiga saved him. </p><p> </p><p>Also his kisses, it wasn't just a physical attraction. But it was one of Hokuto's ways to tell someone that he really fell for them. He wouldn't just kiss anyone or sucked their lips randomly. He wouldn't do that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>… Maybe it was really love.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Hokuto was just surprised because he never fell for a man, especially a siren before.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Maybe they might have been in love with each other without them realizing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto tucked the strand of Taiga's hair behind his ears and smiled genuinely, bringing their forehead touched and sharing the warmth as they breathed in front of each other's lips. </p><p> </p><p>The wind of autumn blew towards them. The strong waves crashed the rocks behind them. The red-ish sun ray peeked behind Hokuto's body as if it wanted to join their warmth moment before leaving them. </p><p> </p><p>Upon the end of the cold autumn, they both sat above the beautiful sand. The sounds of waves and wind churned behind them, and among their throbbing hearts and their soft breath that filled their ears, they kissed again until the moon replaced the sun and made their night sparkle. </p>

<p>The sun rays touched Hokuto's skin, making him stirred. He opened his eyes slowly and rubbed them gently, letting them wander around, seeing the beautiful sky above him. The foam of waves kissed his feet and made him shiver. He took a look at his clothes and found it wet. His hands touched the ground and met the sand. </p><p> </p><p>"Hmmm?" His brows furrowed. He didn't remember how he fell asleep on the shore. How could it be? He turned his face towards his left and found Taiga's sleeping face beside him.</p><p> </p><p>He stared wide-eyed as he tried to remember what happened to him yesterday. He remembered he went back to the sea after fighting hard his hesitation, bringing his lunch box with him, and going out alone using the boat to meet Taiga in the cave. But he was surprised when he saw Taiga was already there, waiting for him. And then he talked, they talked a lot, about many things that Hokuto never expected he would hear. Especially when Taiga told him about his feelings. How confused he was about it and how he really wanted to figure it out.</p><p> </p><p>His cheeks started blushing as he remembered how he asked him bravely to date him. He also remembered how they kissed, soft and gentle kisses yet sexy. Hokuto brought his palms to hide his face as he felt the heat spread over his cheeks. He took a deep breath as his heart started pounding hard.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a look at someone from between his fingers, someone that just called his name softly, someone that just woke up and looked at him beautifully. Hokuto lowered his hands and looked at Taiga in front of him. His pale skin glimmered together with his scales, his hand laid weakly beside him, his hair fall covered his eyes, and his lips slightly opened as if he waited for any answer. Hokuto moved closer to Taiga and brushed his hair gently, tucking it behind his ear as the sound of waves passed through his own ears. </p><p> </p><p>"Good morning…" Hokuto spoke gently. Taiga blinked and placed his hand over Hokuto's cheek, eyes locked on him.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of waves became unheard due to the loud sound of their hearts beating. The sunlight shining on them from the eastern horizon, only made them look more beautiful in front of each other's eyes. Taiga turned his eyes and moved his palm to Hokuto's chest, feeling his heartbeat. It was loud and fast, faster than the last time he felt it. And knowing it only made Taiga's heart beat faster. He turned his eyes to meet Hokuto's gaze in front of him. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't the first time for Taiga to see how handsome Hokuto was, but seeing him smiling warmly at him among the ray of sun that shone on Hokuto and enhanced the handsomeness of his figure, only made Taiga's heart flutter. Hokuto's caressing touch on his cheeks made Taiga hold his breath. Taiga's eyes followed Hokuto's lips as he lowered his body, landing a soft kiss on his. The kiss was light, leaving no sounds when they were apart.</p><p> </p><p>But it was soft and warm. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you hungry?" Hokuto whispered in front of Taiga's lips. Taiga blinked and shook his head, "No, I'm not." Hokuto smiled, he didn't say anything afterwards as he kept his eyes on Taiga's while tucking Taiga's strand hair behind his ear. </p><p> </p><p>"Are you?" </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto could feel his cheeks getting warm. Did a siren can read a human's mind too?</p><p> </p><p>"Just a bit." </p><p> </p><p>Of course it was a lie. Hokuto was starving but he didn't want to show it to Taiga. More likely, he didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay any longer, spending more time with Taiga under the sun, admiring his beautiful figure. </p><p> </p><p>"Taiga… "</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hummed softly.</p><p> </p><p>"When do you usually catch your prey?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked. He didn't expect that Hokuto would throw him another question about this thing again.</p><p> </p><p>"At twilight, until the sky becomes completely dark."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded, "How?" he added. </p><p> </p><p>Taga woke his body to sit beside him, "well, I sing a song and then they would see many things and bring themselves to jump into the ocean. They drown, and I will let them die."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto hummed and gave a nod, lowering his head as he thought about something else. But it seemed like Taiga misunderstood him.</p><p> </p><p>"But I don't do it anymore, catching prey or eating them… " he said quietly while lowering his head. He didn't want Hokuto to think that he was still hunting humans.</p><p> </p><p>"I do believe you, don't worry." Hokuto said while cupping Taiga's cheeks. </p><p> </p><p>"Did you eat well?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head slowly, "Like I said, I was starved, but fish doesn't taste that great."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled as he stroked Taiga's head gently. He probably knew the reason Taiga lost appetite, so he had a plan for their next time. It might be crazy but it was worth trying.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you leaving now?" Taiga asked again, tilting his head slightly to meet Hokuto's eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes softened. He didn't want to leave, but he really had to. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry…" he spoke softly, "I have to change and I have to eat something. My bottle is already empty too."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wanted to ask Hokuto to stay, but he realized he had to go back to his place too. He had spent the night together too long. He worried that those sirens might suspect him again.</p><p> </p><p>"It's okay."</p><p> </p><p>"But will you come to see me again?" Taiga reached Hokuto's hand on the sand and held it tight. Hokuto smiled genuinely as he placed his other hand over Taiga's, "I will! I promise," said Hokuto as he planted a soft kiss on Taiga's knuckle.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga brought himself to the sea before Hokuto. So he could watch his boyfriend pushing his boat to the shore, putting back his own stuff inside it and getting ready to leave. But before that, Hokuto walked closer to Taiga, letting his clothes soaked as he walked into the water. Taiga frowned in wonder, why Hokuto came closer and bent down to reach him. But before he asked, he found himself gasped after being pulled into his embrace. Hokuto buried his face on Taiga's shoulder, feeding himself by kissing Taiga's ethereal skin, and filling his lungs with Taiga's scent. He tightened his embrace, not wanting to let Taiga off him.</p><p> </p><p>"Please wait for me again here." Hokuto whispered to him. Taiga's heart was beating faster again, but now there was a small sting inside that he still wasn't sure where it came from. </p><p> </p><p>But he chose not to think about it. He chose to hook his arms around Hokuto's shoulders and closed his eyes, burying his face on his shoulder and filling his lungs with Hokuto's scent.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm leaving." Hokuto pulled himself back and landed a soft kiss on Taiga's forehead. Caressing Taiga's cheeks behind his scales with his fingertip for the last time before leaving him alone.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga waved at Hokuto until he couldn't see his back anymore. He let out a long sigh, already wanting to see Hokuto again. But he had to think about himself for now.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his fin and swam down. He couldn't deny that he was being alarmed that other sirens might follow him again this time. Remi might throw him some questions — <em>stupid questions</em> if Taiga could say. So he prepared himself, even for the worst thing.</p><p> </p><p>But on the way to his place, Taiga didn't see any siren around. He met a group of turtles that migrated to the other side of the ocean. He met a couple of whales swimming around, catching their food. He saw a group of dolphins swimming above him.</p><p> </p><p>But he saw no sirens around. </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga arrived at his place, he saw a group of sirens surrounding something. Taiga let his fin flow as he looked at them, trying to see what they were doing. And then Taiga saw a small boat split in two and crushed several people underneath, probably three or four humans as he saw some feet laid on the sand. It seemed like someone just came back from hunting. Taiga trailed his eyes to see those sirens, trying to find out whether Juri and Remi were there or not.</p><p> </p><p>But he didn't see them.</p><p> </p><p>"Weird." He mumbled to himself, brows furrowed as he kept his eyes on those sirens. They were so busy with their own business that they didn't even recognize Taiga who stared at them. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga pushed his body by moving his tail up and down, entering his own cave while thinking about what he just saw. Well, that was a good thing if they ignored him, though. That was what Taiga wanted. So he could go anywhere to meet Hokuto. But he still couldn't let his guard down because it might be just their trick to fool him. He really thought that Remi might have a plan to take him down.</p><p> </p><p>So he remained alert.</p><p> </p><p>He never showed any suspicious behavior, going out from his cave as usual, catching fishes to be his food even though he just piled them up on the flat rock inside his cave and left them untouched because they were tasteless. </p><p> </p><p>But Taiga wasn't sure about something. Was it because he remained to act normal so there were no sirens watching him? Or they just really stopped doing it? He still remembered how Remi accused him for doing something and how other sirens kept watching him from afar, but none of them did it these days.</p><p> </p><p>"Weird."</p><p> </p><p>It was weird, indeed. Because Remi was not a typical that would give up on a fight, especially after Taiga threatened her. Remi hated being lost. She never showed it but Taiga knew. Taiga had expected that Remi might tell King Jesse about it or watch him again and again. But she didn't do it. No one did. </p><p> </p><p>Then what happened here? Did she really give up? Did she tell the others to stop watching him? </p><p> </p><p>Well, that meant Taiga managed to take her down. But he still found that was something uncommon behavior from them, especially Remi.</p><p> </p><p>"Then, should I move?" Taiga suddenly thought popped up. If he thought about it, it would be a good chance for him to leave and find another place. Nobody paid attention to him. Nobody cared about what he did. He could leave now and find a new place close to the cave up there, to make it easier for him to see if Hokuto had arrived or not. He was still worried that other sirens might find Hokuto too, like Yae did.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, maybe I can leave now."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam out of his place quietly after bidding a goodbye to several fishes that had been friends with him. Lucky him for getting some help from them on checking the situation around his cave before he left.  </p><p> </p><p>A small hole that turned out to be the mouth of a cave under the ocean had become his new place. The entrance was small but the sunlight could reach its ground. But when Taiga entered it, it was spacious inside. This place could protect him from enemies by watching them while hiding on the other side of the cave. The water pressure was not that strong and the temperature was quite cold.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Taiga!!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his face as he heard a voice calling him.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto… " </p><p> </p><p>He flipped his fin and swam fastly to get out, getting ready to meet him.</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga appeared on the surface, he saw Hokuto had arrived and left his boat in front of their cave. Hokuto turned his body and met Taiga's half body watching him, waving at him energetically. Hokuto let his feet sinked into the sand and let the waves touched his ankle to his legs as he walked towards Taiga while smiling cheerfully.</p><p> </p><p>He bent down and reached Taiga who arrived on the shore, "let me help you," he said before lifting Taiga's body, carrying him like a bride. Taiga gasped as his body seemed to float from the ground and hooked his arm around Hokuto's neck unintentionally. Hokuto didn't want Taiga to drag himself like he used to do. So before it happened, he took this chance to lift his boyfriend and walk with him to their cave.</p><p> </p><p>He looked at Taiga in his arms. A warm smile formed on his own lips as he realized how close their faces were, making their hearts pounding.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want to be here or inside?" Hokuto spoke in his low voice. Taiga was too stunned to speak. He never heard the best low voice before and he didn't know that Hokuto could speak like that.</p><p> </p><p>"H-here. I wanna stay under the sun." Taiga replied, averting his eyes from Hokuto. Taiga loosened his arms as Hokuto lowered him slowly. He remained his head down as he felt how hot his cheeks were. His heart was beating faster than usual.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait a minute." Hokuto left Taiga alone and walked to his boat. He took two sacks of wood from the boat, camping equipment; a tent, a flashlight, and cooking items, and placed them all inside the cave. He walked back towards Taiga who had been watching him while sitting beautifully under the sun.</p><p> </p><p>"Let's cook!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took out a tuna and a squid as big as his arm. He also took out some veggies; carrots, tomatoes, and a cabbage.</p><p> </p><p>"Where do you get this?" Taiga asked,pointing at tuna and squid.</p><p> </p><p>"I bought them earlier. I wish I could fish here but I have never done that before," Hokuto answered softly. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at them for a while, thinking about something before he let his words out, "I will help you to catch them later." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked at him and smiled. He took tuna and squid and started cleaning them. He opened tuna's gills and cleaned its scales. He also cleaned squid and cut them very skillfully using a knife into small pieces. Taiga who had been watching him found something that caught his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"That… looks like my fin. What is that?"</p><p> </p><p>"This one?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"This is a knife." Hokuto answered while turning the knife side by side. Taiga reached out his hand as if he asked Hokuto to hand him the knife. He took it and looked at it for a while, checking its shape before placing it beside his sharp fin, realizing that both had sharp edges, but the knife in his hand had two different shapes.</p><p> </p><p>"Is it the same function as mine?" Taiga asked, feeling curious.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto nodded, "Well, we use the knife to cut or peel or slice something. We use it for cooking. I think the difference with your sharp fin is that holding it is easier."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hummed softly and nodded again. Feeling amazed how humans could make a sharp thing like this. It didn't take long for Taiga to understand that this knife might be dangerous for others too if they have looked the same as his sharp fin. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga gave it back to Hokuto to let him finish his cooking. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto added some spices to a bowl and mixed the tuna into it. Taiga kept staring with his round eyes as he saw Hokuto mixed everything inside the bowl. The appearance of the fish, which was now a bit dark in color, made him wrinkled. </p><p> </p><p>"Yosh! Now let's light the fire!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's round eyes followed where Hokuto went. His lips slightly pursed as he watched Hokuto stacked all that wood and took a small piece of them and held it in his hand. After that, he took a small object from his trouser pocket and pointed it at the wood in his other hand.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga gasped as he saw a spark of light come out of Hokuto's hand.</p><p> </p><p>"What's that?" He asked, eyes widened in surprise. But before he got an answer, another spark came out again and this one was getting bigger. Taiga dragged himself away as he saw Hokuto throw that light onto those woods and made a bigger light. </p><p> </p><p>"Wh-what is that, Hokuto?" He asked again, but Hokuto didn't answer him. Taiga didn't know whether Hokuto didn't hear him because of how far their distance was or because his own voice was carried by the noise of waves and the strong wind around.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto placed a couple of rocks on its sides. Taiga thought he couldn't be more confused but then he saw Hokuto placed something like a plate rock or something else above it, pouring a liquid onto it and putting tuna over it.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's brows furrowed, his mouth hanging loosely and his webbed hand clenched into the sand. What did Hokuto do? Was it how Hokuto made their food? What was that yellow orange-ish light between the rocks? Why did he hear some noises from it?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could only blink and waited for Hokuto to finish then answer his questions. He turned his face to drag himself away but before he did that, a good aroma tickled his nose. He sniffed a few times and realized it came from Hokuto's food. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto moved the fried tuna onto its plate and washed the pan before he cooked another dish.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga for the first time ignored what Hokuto did and dragged himself a bit closer to the light. His mouth still slightly opened. His eyes got rounder as he found the light moved by itself as if they were dancing. There were crackling and popping sounds from it.</p><p> </p><p>He found it… beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>"Why is it warm?" Taiga mumbled to himself. It was the same feeling whenever he got close to Hokuto, but this one felt different. He could feel the warmth coming from outside. Taiga found himself getting carried away by the beauty of its light. His eyes sparkled and Hokuto, who had been watching him from afar, smiled genuinely. He found Taiga looked cuter when he got impressed by something. He didn't answer his question not because he didn't listen, he just wanted to see how Taiga would find out about fire.</p><p> </p><p>Well, he just wanted to enjoy the cuteness of his boyfriend more. </p><p> </p><p>He cooked the squid and seasoned it until he got a perfect taste. He poured a half bottle of water onto it and stirred it until it thickened. When he was done, he poured the sauteed squid onto its plate and brought the food towards Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"It's done!!" said Hokuto while placing the food above the sand. Taiga was stunned to see the food in front of him. His eyes wandered over every color in the food that Hokuto made; green, red, orange; tuna colored like a golden and squid that no longer looked like a squid. Taiga's brows furrowed, he wasn't sure about the taste of its food, but he couldn't deny how good the aroma was.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh! wait, I forgot the rice." Hokuto stood up and walked inside to take two boxes of rice that he had cooked earlier. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga couldn't take his eyes off the food as he swallowed hard. He really wanted to taste its tuna. He didn't even realize that Hokuto had come back and handed him another plate and added rice onto it.</p><p> </p><p>"Let's eat!" He said cheerfully. Hokuto cut off a small portion of the fish and placed it onto his plate, eating them peacefully. The fresh taste of the spices that seeped in mixed with the soft texture of the tuna spread in his mouth. The sound of the strong wind and the roar of the waves seemed to add to the pleasure of the food that was starting to flow down his throat.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto pinched a bit of tuna and handed it to Taiga who had been staring at him. "Try it!" Taiga hesitantly opened his mouth and ate the fish from Hokuto's hand, chewing it slowly while letting the soft taste of it spread in his mouth. The sweet, salty and fresh flavors of the fish mixed into one, very different from what he usually ate in the water. </p><p> </p><p>"It's yummy," said Taiga softly. Hokuto smiled warmly as he kept feeding Taiga by his hand, watching how Taiga's eyes spoke about how happy he was and how bloomed his cheeks were. Even though Hokuto could see how hard Taiga held his lips downward, he knew that his boyfriend was enjoying his food. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked smaller than before. It hurt him after knowing that Taiga didn't eat well after he stopped hunting. He thought maybe Taiga just needed to eat human's food as he remembered how Taiga seemed to be enjoying the last steak that he cooked.</p><p> </p><p>That was why he wanted to do this, bringing some of his cooking stuff and making delicious food only for Taiga. It was tiring, but seeing Taiga and being next to him made his tiredness disappear. </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Weeks by weeks had passed. The waves were getting stronger, the wind was getting wilder. The sun was still shining brightly, but the weather became colder. </p><p> </p><p>At least that was how Hokuto felt.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't count how many times they had spent their time together. Hokuto came to visit Taiga and spent his entire night with him then came back to his own place in the afternoon the next day. He even made their cave look more comfortable. He placed some portable lights in the corner, and making a tent to keep his stuff for their needs. Hokuto brought a futon camper for him to sleep beside Taiga outside the tent. He wished they could spend their night inside, but Taiga told him that it would be difficult for him to go out when he needed to go to the sea. So Hokuto chose this way. As long as he could be with Taiga, he would be fine.</p><p> </p><p>Another moment that Hokuto loved was whenever Taiga threw him so many questions. Whenever Taiga saw something that caught his attention, he would ask. It started from a heavy question like the first time he saw a fire and why it could burn, then what the warmth was, why the sun could give it too. How to save humans from drowning, would they die if nobody saved them. What the seasons were, and how many seasons in the world, what did humans do up there, was it the same as sirens did underwater.</p><p> </p><p>Then he moved to other questions like when the first time he knew the fork and the spoon and how to make them. What was a bottle and where was it. Why did the bowl look like a pearl shell, and so on.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga would ask everything until the simple questions about Hokuto's days, about Hokuto's clothes, about how Hokuto's house looked, about what Hokuto did before he slept, about what Hokuto did when he woke up. </p><p> </p><p>Everything that tickled his curiosity, Taiga would ask them. </p><p> </p><p>"What's that?" Taiga asked as he saw Hokuto wrapped something around his neck after lighting the fire.</p><p> </p><p>"This?" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga nodded.</p><p> </p><p>"This is a scarf. The weather is colder and I need this to keep me warm."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hummed softly as he nodded, keeping his eyes on his boyfriend, paying attention to his figure.</p><p> </p><p>"You look great." Taiga said after a while, making Hokuto's cheeks flutter. He knew Taiga always locked his eyes on him, just like what Hokuto did to him. But the difference was Taiga didn't understand what he did. Taiga didn't know if locking his eyes on Hokuto only made Hokuto's heart pounding loudly. He did his best to hide himself when he blushed, but Taiga never took his eyes off him.</p><p> </p><p>"Your ears turned red again." He said calmly, making the younger stutter.</p><p> </p><p>"C-can you stop saying that?" said Hokuto before he walked away, filling his lungs with the winter wind as he felt his heart almost jump out. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's lips slightly pursed as his eyes remained on Hokuto's figure. Watching him walking towards the shore. Admiring his side figure under the sun. Hokuto's hair blew and danced beautifully because of the wind.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto, he was completely made of handsomeness. Taiga had met a lot of humans but he never met a human with a perfect figure like Hokuto. He has a beautiful tip of nose, a sharp jawline and cheekbones, thin lips with a mole in the corner that made him look more attractive, and a pair of eyes that were soft and took his heart. Not only his figure but Hokuto's nature was also beautiful. Being with him made Taiga feel comfortable, warm, safe, and… loved?</p><p> </p><p>"Eh? Mr. Kame?" Taiga looked down at a turtle, a big and old turtle that touched his tail.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Hello, Taiga."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"I thought you migrated!"</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"I'm too old for that. I prefer to stay here until I die."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't say anything as he gently stroked the turtle's shell.</p><p> </p><p>"Who's that boy?" The turtle asked.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at Hokuto before he lowered his head, a corner of his lips slightly up, "my boyfriend," he replied softly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Aha! I knew it! You look like you really love him."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his eyes towards Hokuto, looking at him who was currently crouching and playing in the sand.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Kame… "</p><p> </p><p>"Can you tell me what love is?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his eyes to the turtle beside him. </p><p> </p><p>
<em>"That's a very difficult question." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Even you don't know about that?" Taiga asked, staring in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"It's a complex emotion, Taiga." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"It's something that causes you to feel happy, warm, and comfortable. But it also causes you to feel sad, longing, and lonely." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Love is when you think about others more than yourself. Love is when you care about others more than yourself. And love is when you just want to see them happy and protect them."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Love is when you think that they're more important than yourself."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"How do I know that I'm in love?"</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Ask your heart, what are you feeling towards him? Take a deep look at your heart and you will find out."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"And don't forget that you're half human, and you have heart. Being a sadistic siren that eats humans didn't make you lose your heart, Taiga. You just didn't use it."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes softened as he thought about it. He turned his eyes and met Hokuto who smiled brightly and waved at him energetically while telling him that he finished making a sandcastle.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Taiga realized, spending a lot of time with Hokuto made him understand human nature more than before. He learned a lot from him about many things. Even though there were still a lot of things he didn't understand because he didn't ask. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto always teach him and explained many things to him in the simplest way. Taiga asked a lot of things not only because he felt curious about it. It made him happy by hearing how Hokuto spoke to him gently.</p><p> </p><p>It made him happy when Hokuto cooked for him. It made him happy when he slept in Hokuto's arms. It made him happy when Hokuto whispered to him at night, telling some stories before they slept. It made him happy by seeing how handsome Hokuto was when he slept or when he woke up. It made him happy by feeling Hokuto's caressing touch on his skin. It made him happy by watching Hokuto doing anything.</p><p> </p><p>And it made him happy by seeing Hokuto smile at him or laugh with him.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Hokuto's smile made him think that they were the only ones in this world. Seeing Hokuto's smile gave warmth inside him. Seeing Hokuto's smile made his heart pound. Seeing Hokuto's smile was everything.</p><p> </p><p>But he knew it must be difficult for Hokuto to deal with the cold at night. It must be tiring for Hokuto to come this far from the shore to this place. It must be worrying for Hokuto if he didn't meet Taiga here. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga felt bad for making Hokuto do those things for him.</p><p> </p><p>"I wish I could spend my time with him in his world, staying with him in a proper place, walking with him under the sun, so he doesn't have to carry me," said Taiga while lowering his head, staring at his tail in sadness. He never thought about how a human's world would be because he was never interested to know. He could say he was still not interested, but knowing how difficult it was for Hokuto to come here, only squeezed his heart.</p><p> </p><p>"For the first time in my life, I wish I wasn't born to be a siren…" Taiga looked at the turtle, blinking a few times as he felt his eyes sting.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"If you become a human, would your story with him be different? Would you still meet him? Would you still fall in love with him?"</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked deeply at his tail deeply. Of course he would still fall in love with Hokuto. Taiga as a siren, or Taiga who was reborn as a human, he would still fall in love with Hokuto. If he couldn't meet him, he would find him until they meet and fall in love.</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his face towards someone who called him. Someone that caused the warmth inside him. Someone that took his days and his night for thinking about him. Someone who completely took his heart.</p><p> </p><p>"Yea?"</p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked down at the turtle beside him, "just talking with my friend."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's brows furrowed, looking confused. </p><p> </p><p>"Come here," he added. Taiga reached out his hand for Hokuto to take and sat beside him.</p><p> </p><p>The winter wind blew towards them, brushing Taiga's hair and covering half of his face as he looked at Hokuto beside him.</p><p> </p><p>"What were you doing there?"</p><p> </p><p>"I was just… playing and thinking of the reason I came to this place at first."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga tilted his head to see Hokuto's face, "and what is that?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned his eyes to meet Taiga's. His dazzling eyes that were surrounded by the glitter of his scales, speaking to him. His dazzling eyes that looked softer than the first time they met.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to see the beauty of nature."</p><p> </p><p>"You know that I have always loved nature. I always want to see the beauty of them. But I don't know how beautiful nature is underwater."</p><p> </p><p>"I want to know. I want to see it."</p><p> </p><p>"But I'm not good at swimming." Hokuto laughed softly, feeling embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at him in confusion. His lips slightly pursed and his brows furrowed.</p><p> </p><p>"Why do you want to see the beauty of this place?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked at his boyfriend, brows slightly furrowed.</p><p> </p><p>"Am I not beautiful enough for you?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was stunned. He couldn't believe that Taiga would attack him with a fact that he could never deny. </p><p> </p><p>"Y-you…" he gulped, "you don't understand what you are talking about, do you?"</p><p> </p><p>"Who told you that?" Hokuto added, holding back his smile as he felt the heat over his body.</p><p> </p><p>"That's what the others said about me. You told me the same, didn't you?"</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Oh,Taiga…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga knew how to make Hokuto blush until he felt like he wanted to run away before Taiga saw him melt.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah! Your ears turned r—..." </p><p> </p><p>Before Taiga could continue, Hokuto placed his finger over his lips, telling him to stop. Taiga needed to be stopped or Hokuto might melt in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes followed Hokuto who came closer towards him, breathing softly in front of his face. He lowered his finger and looked at Taiga's lips before landing a light kiss onto it.</p><p> </p><p>"You're the most beautiful man I've ever seen. No one can beat your beauty." Even the beauty of women couldn't win over Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>"But you and this ocean aren't the same. And I still want to see it. How about bringing me to your place?" Hokuto asked, more likely teasing him.</p><p> </p><p>"I can take you, but not to my place. It's too dangerous." Taiga spoke softly in front of Hokuto's lips.</p><p> </p><p>As Taiga thought about how to take Hokuto to go with him, the turtle came again while biting something inside his mouth. He placed it onto Taiga's tail and spoke to him.</p><p> </p><p>"Eh? The magical seaweed?"</p><p> </p><p>"I thought it was extinct."</p><p> </p><p>
<em>"Well I keep it with me so the others wouldn't find it."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"You keep it in your place? You should have told me earlier!!" Taiga whined. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked at them with a grin, feeling amused by a view that he saw in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>"Eat it," said Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, what do you mean? The magical seaweed?" Hokuto asked, looking in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>"It can help you to breathe underwater. Come on, I will grant your wish."</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto flapped his feet fastly, trying to swim and making sure his body moved while holding Taiga's hand who swam beside him. The waves underwater felt usual, the water felt cold but not as cold as he thought. Even up there it still felt colder.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe because of the warmth over Hokuto's body that made him not feel the cold.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his fin slowly, following Hokuto's move beside him. Letting him enjoy his surroundings. He took Hokuto to a better place in the middle of the sea, not too far from their place but in a different direction to his own place. Taiga still worried that others sirens might see them. Even though he never saw them around, it was still better to remain alert.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned his face side by side, seeing a hundred flashy fish swimming together, playing around, or hiding in the coral reefs. He felt amazed by how those fishes swam together into different directions without hitting each other. He swam above their houses and saw many wonderful colors of coral reefs below him; blue, green, red, pink, and purple, various colors that reflected in light and attracted anyone who saw it. Hokuto thought he would only learn about them in college or saw them in the documentary. Never once he thought that he would see them real, in front of his eyes. Fascinating him by its colors, bringing happiness towards him by seeing how fishes hid inside those reefs.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned his face to his right and met a group of fur seals swimming. Riding the waves up there and dancing energetically. He looked at them wide-eyed, mouth opened as if he was unable to hide his admiration.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto!!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto turned his head towards Taiga, meeting Taiga's softened eyes and as if they were smiling towards him. Hokuto was panicked when Taiga let go of his hand slowly, leaving the last touch on his hand as Taiga swam backwards while watching him. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was panicked he would drown deeper, but then he found himself floating. A pair of dolphins were swimming under him and carrying him. Hokuto sighed in relief and smiled freely, stroking gently the heads of the dolphins with his hands. Taiga could see how happy Hokuto was by his smile.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's smile was bright, as bright as the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's smile was warm, as warm as the sun in winter.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's cheeks flushed in pink as he saw Taiga swimming and flipping his fin beautifully above him. Dancing along with the fur seals, riding the waves.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam down and handed out his hand, waiting for Hokuto to take it. Taiga grabbed Hokuto's hand and flipped his tail hard, throwing Hokuto's body gently above him without letting go of their hands, flipping their bodies and making a circle under the sunlight. Dancing together among the fur seals, the dolphins, and the flashy fishes around them. When Hokuto reached the ground, Taiga pulled him and brought him into his embrace, looping his arms around Hokuto's waist, making Hokuto laugh freely.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto removed his hand between their chest and hooked it around Taiga's shoulders. He nuzzled his temple over Taiga's head as a beaming smile formed on his lips. He tightened his embrace as he felt their heartbeat was pounding in the same rhythm, sharing their warm breath in front of each other's lips.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto brought his forehead closer to touch Taiga's, gazing at him deeply, admiring Taiga's figure for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>Just how long they had been spending their time? </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes had become softer and softer. They were still dazzling, alluring, and could hypnotize Hokuto just by looking at them. But Taiga's eyes became softer. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto didn't know whether Taiga was like this, or whether his personality had changed. But it didn't matter, though. He loved Taiga just the way he was.</p><p> </p><p>He loved Taiga whenever he asked about a lot of things. He loved Taiga when he poured all attention towards him without Taiga himself realizing. He loved Taiga for being the reason for himself to smile. He loved Taiga for being honest with his feelings. He loved Taiga who ate his food heartily. He loved Taiga who looked at him with his sparkling eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto loved everything about Taiga. Even if he had to sacrifice himself and his time to meet Taiga this far in the middle of this ocean, he would do that. As long as he could be with Taiga, it would be fine. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto brought his face closer and planted some soft kisses on Taiga's lips as he spoke, "thank you… thank you for creating the most beautiful memory with me."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you for becoming mine, Taiga." Hokuto added, speaking gently as he landed a kiss on Taiga's lips. A long kiss when their lips stayed, a long kiss that felt different than their usual kisses, a long kiss that was full of tenderness.</p><p> </p><p>A long kiss that was full of happiness, warmth, and love.</p><p> </p><p>"Did I tell you that I'm in love with you?" Hokuto whispered after breaking the kiss, caressing Taiga's face and planting some kisses over his face.</p><p> </p><p>"You did… "</p><p> </p><p>"Every night in our place before we sleep."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto brushed his nose gently over Taiga's while speaking gently in a low voice, "Is it making you bored?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga placed his hands over Hokuto's shoulders and let them hang, admiring Hokuto's soft and handsome figure in front of his eyes, watching how Hokuto's hair danced beautifully in the water.</p><p> </p><p>"I will never get bored with you."</p><p> </p><p>Never.</p><p> </p><p>There was no doubt about it. Taiga would never get bored with Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>Even if Taiga could spend his entire life with Hokuto, he would never get bored. He would do anything with Hokuto. He wanted to be with him. He wanted to see Hokuto wake up everyday beside him. He wanted to sleep in Hokuto arms every night. He wanted to hear Hokuto whisper his endearment to him everyday. He wanted to eat Hokuto's food everyday. He wanted to see Hokuto's smile. He wanted to be the reason for Hokuto to smile. He wanted to hear Hokuto's laugh. He wanted to be with him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wanted to be with Hokuto. In the siren world, in the human world. As long as he could be with Hokuto, he would take it.</p><p> </p><p>Even if he had to sacrifice his life to save Hokuto, he would do that.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto brought themselves to the shore and took a seat side by side. His clothes soaked, his hair completely hardened. His eyes sting because of swimming underwater.</p><p> </p><p>But his heart was full of joy. He felt delighted. It felt like a dream to see the beauty of nature under the sea. Especially when he spent his time with his beloved one in his favorite place, under the sea.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto changed his clothes and got ready to go back home. The sun would go down soon, he had to hurry so he could arrive on the shore before night. </p><p> </p><p>"Will your friend ask again this time?" Taiga asked while playing with a crab on his palms.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed, "Kochi will always ask. He's so noisy that he can't stop asking about where I spend my time every Saturday," said Hokuto while placing his bag onto the boat.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you tell him about us?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto stopped moving, he blinked and let out a long sigh through his nose.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to, but I don't know how to tell him about us."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga lowered his head when Hokuto turned his face towards him. He didn't know how he felt after hearing that. He didn't care about other humans, he didn't care about the human world.</p><p> </p><p>But Hokuto lived there, he had a friend that seemed so close to him. And Taiga didn't know why but he felt like he wanted to know more about those things.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto walked closer to him, bending down and pulling Taiga into his embrace. Stroking his damp hair gently, whispering endearments and kissing Taiga's skin repeatedly. As if he knew that Taiga needed it.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto bid him good-bye, waving gently at his beloved one. Watching Taiga's figure that half of his body had disappeared into the water, until he completely disappeared from his sight because of their distance. His heart stung, already missing Taiga and his touch. Knowing how Taiga swam closer to him to be able to see him longer only squeezed Hokuto's heart.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to go back to their place but Hokuto himself needed to go back home. He swallowed hard the lump in his throat and sped up his boat. The roaring waves among the wind filled his ears. The red-ish sunlight scattered around the sky. The winter wind touched his skin, making him shiver. He meant to pull up the scarf around his neck but then he realized that he didn't wear it. </p><p> </p><p>"Eh?"</p><p> </p><p>He looked around on his boat but he found nothing. Hokuto thought about where he placed his scarf.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah!"</p><p> </p><p>He remembered that he placed his scarf inside the tent, beside his futon. Hokuto had gone this far, it took time if he went back to the cave. He probably wouldn't arrive in the evening. Also the scarf was not really important though. He could deal with the cold.</p><p> </p><p>But he already missed Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to meet him again.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to hug him.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to talk to him.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to touch him.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to see him again.</p><p> </p><p>So he turned around. He went back to the cave just to meet Taiga. If Taiga wasn't there, he would call him like usual. Hokuto was sure Taiga must have felt the same as him. He was sure Taiga would come to him.</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto saw their cave, he called him. He called Taiga with all his heart, again and again and again until he could meet him. Hokuto even jumped from his boat before it completely stopped, letting his trousers soaked into the water, following the waves who came to the shore.</p><p> </p><p>As he arrived, he took his scarf and called Taiga again louder.</p><p> </p><p>But Taiga didn't appear. He didn't show up like usual.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>What happened?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Did something happen to him?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga…?"</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga!!!!!" </p><p> </p><p>"Taiga!!!!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto tried his best to call him but Taiga didn't show up. Hokuto sighed, letting out a long breath that was fleeting in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Taiga was somewhere and didn't hear him. Hokuto just hoped Taiga was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto walked towards his boat, getting ready to leave the shore. He got into the boat and turned on the flashlight as the sky was already dark. He turned around the boat and left the shore.</p><p> </p><p>But not even a minute later, he heard a voice, calling him.</p><p> </p><p>Softly, slowly, like an angel.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Hokuto thought it was Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>But he realized it sounded different. It wasn't Taiga. Taiga would never sound like this. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't Taiga, he would never hurt him. It would never be Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto fought back the voice, talking loudly to himself, trying to ignore the voices echoing around him.</p><p> </p><p>"You're not Taiga, you are not Taiga!" Hokuto repeated it to himself over and over again as he kept focusing himself on looking ahead. He sped up his boat and covered his ears with his scarf. He sang a song, his favorite song that he used to sing quietly. He sang it out loud as he tried to fight back the voice.</p><p> </p><p>But the voice was getting louder. It was squeaky, hurting his ears and making Hokuto's head spin. </p><p> </p><p>The world spun, his vision blurred, cold sweat trickled down his face. Hokuto breathed heavily, trying to be calm to ignore the squeaky voice.</p><p> </p><p>But Hokuto was weaker than he thought. He couldn't fight it. He couldn't win over it. His body felt heavy. The boat was starting to tilt and was about to flip.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto couldn't fight it.</p><p> </p><p>He lost.</p><p> </p><p>His body moved by itself. His boat flipped and made him fall into the ocean. He couldn't move, his voice stuck in his throat.</p><p> </p><p>He lost.</p><p> </p><p>His body drawn into the dark and the cold water, his breath became unsteady. His ears became deaf. His heavy eyelids forced him to shut his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>He lost.</p><p> </p><p>He lost but he still had hope. He still wanted to believe. </p><p> </p><p>He wanted to believe that he wouldn't die again this time. He wanted to believe that he would survive again this time. He wanted to believe he would meet Taiga again this time. He wanted to believe that he could spend more of his time with Taiga again this time.</p><p> </p><p>He had hope, but he still lost.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Forgive me, Taiga.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Forgive me if we can't meet again.</em>

<p>Half of Taiga's body already drowned in the water, watching Hokuto's figure at the last moment. The orange-ish sun rays scattered above him. The winter wind blew through his face, brushing his damp hair gently. The waves foam touched his shoulders as he got down into the sea slowly. As Hokuto's figure completely disappeared from his sight, Taiga flipped his fin, leaving the surface.</p><p> </p><p>A group of flashy fish and fur seals greeted him as he swam down. Some of them were cheering him on and some were busy swimming around him. Some of them were bombarding him with a hundred questions about how he and Hokuto started everything.  Taiga didn't answer any of their questions, but it didn't mean he ignored them. He just couldn't resist the heat and the tickle feeling all over his body. His heart was beating so hard, making him think that it was going to jump out. The heat over his face could no longer be stopped. His cheeks bloomed reddish, adding a new beauty behind his emerald scales. Taiga bit his lips, holding back all the feelings that were overflowing inside him, not wanting to show it to others how happy he was.</p><p> </p><p>Never once did he think that he would spend time with his beloved one under the sea where he lived. The memory of the beautiful smile etched on Hokuto's face was deeply imprinted in Taiga's mind. How Hokuto's cheeks turned red when he hugged him. How Hokuto's lips beamed when he was surrounded by sea animals. How gently they spoke when they hugged each other among the colorful fish and coral reefs. </p><p> </p><p>Without Taiga realizing, the corner of his lips bloomed, a beautiful smile that showed happiness and love clearly etched in his lips. </p><p> </p><p>The first smile of him in his entire life.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his tail, swam far out to sea, chasing a group of dolphins on the surface and swimming among them. Riding the waves under the dusk sky and feeling the strong winds around them.</p><p> </p><p>The cheeks behind his scales bloomed in pink, his skin glimmering under the red-ish sun rays that scattered around the sky. The pale lips that were originally stiff now softened and raised beautifully, showing a genuine smile. A soft hum escaped from his throat as he felt happiness bloomed in his heart, along with every movement of his tail, sending him swimming further away from his home.</p><p> </p><p>Never once did he think that swimming under the sea and joining other fishes would feel so fun. </p><p> </p><p>Or maybe the reason it became this fun was because he was with Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Everything because of Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Every single feeling that bloomed in his heart was because of Hokuto. Happiness, sadness, joyfulness, yearning, loneliness, curiosity. Everything was because of Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his fin and swam down, going far as he flapped his fin fastly, ignoring all the noise of those fishes around him. All he could hear was just his pounding heart. </p><p> </p><p>The red-ish sun rays had been replaced by the light of the moon. Taiga moved his tail and went up again to see it. He pushed himself harder and harder as he got closer to the surface. Taiga closed his eyes before he reached the surface and a soft smile formed on his lips. He pushed himself harder and made him fly above for a moment as he flipped his body beautifully to face the moon. His lungs filled with the cold of wind in the winter evening. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga opened his eyes to see the moon above him, but instead of the moon, he saw something that was more beautiful than it; Hokuto's face smiling genuinely above him, making his heart burst. Taiga closed his eyes and let himself fall into the sea. His body went down slowly as all the warmth spread over his body. A soft breath escaped from his lips before another hum echoing again around, making those flashy fishes, a group of dolphins, fur seals, and jellyfish dancing along followed the rhythm of Taiga's hum.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his body slowly as he wanted to join in to dance with those animals, but then a big group of anchovies swam below him, surprising him and distracted some animals who were dancing around him. Taiga let his tail flow for a moment, watching how the anchovies' bodies glistened from the glow of the moonlight above them. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga was going to move back as he saw a huge shark coming behind those fishes. He really thought that the shark wanted to hunt them, but then he found out that it swam faster towards him. Taiga flipped his fin fastly and went up to avoid a sudden attack of the huge shark. He looked down at the shark to see it but it was still chasing him. Taiga moved his body fastly before it could catch him. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> "Wait!!! I just want to tell you something!!" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stopped slowly as he looked at the shark, letting it continue.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "The guy!! The guy that was swimming with you!!" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart started pounding in worry. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> "He got caught by another siren!!" </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes widened, his body froze and his pulse increased. His heart was beating fastly and worries started to spread over his body. Taiga was supposed to ask more about it to the shark, confirming whether he saw it right or he just wanted to fool him. But something inside Taiga's heart told him to move his body right away.</p><p> </p><p>Without thinking any longer, Taiga flipped his fin and swam away, leaving the shark who hadn't finished his words. He moved his tail up and down and pushed his body with all his might to arrive at his place as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p>He swam past a bunch of fish and other sea animals. He didn't hear the noises around him, everything became deafening and all he could think was just Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>As Taiga arrived around his place, he saw a siren with a gold tail fin swimming up to catch Hokuto. Taiga's breath stopped, everything seemed to stop. He could only stare wide-eyed, his lips felt dried even though he was in the water. </p><p> </p><p>It was Yae.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his face away and saw Hokuto's body sinking slowly into the darkness of the ocean. He was still wearing the same clothes when the last time Taiga saw him. Without wasting his time any longer, Taiga flipped his fin and jumped far as fast as he could to reach Hokuto before Yae. His heart was pounding hard and his blood started running in his veins. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga grabbed Hokuto's arm and pulled him into his own arms. He swam out of the ocean before Hokuto completely lost his breath. He thought he managed to escape but Yae held his hand and shouted at him. </p><p> </p><p>"What are you doing!!! He's my prey!!!" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his eyes and looked at her. His eyes glow in the dark, full of anger, staring at her sharply as if telling her to let his hand off without saying any words. </p><p> </p><p>She was trembling by Taiga's look and let go of his hand. Taiga turned his face and swam away again before Yae took Hokuto from him.</p><p> </p><p>Yae, who was still trembling, tried to fight her fear to chase Taiga. She took a gulp and swam to chase them while yelling, "I'm not afraid of you!!!!! He's my prey and I want you to let him go!!!!!! Give him to me!!!!!!! Let him go!!!!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't give a <em>fuck</em> of what Yae said and what she was going to do with him. He just wanted to take Hokuto to a safer place. </p><p> </p><p>But at that time, Taiga just learned that Yae was stubborn.</p><p> </p><p>She was so <em> damn </em> stubborn for chasing Taiga and kept yelling at him, asking him to stop and letting Hokuto off. Taiga gritted his fangs as he kept flipping his tail up and down, swimming away before her and ignoring everything she said.</p><p> </p><p>But she grabbed his hand again and said, "It is my prey!!"</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"HE IS MINE!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"DIDN'T YOU HEAR?! HE IS MINE AND YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO TOUCH HIM BECAUSE HE IS MINE!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shouted back at her while keeping Hokuto in his arms, gritting his fangs, staring in anger at Yae as if he was seeing his prey.</p><p> </p><p>He was ready to attack.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's breath became heavy as he felt anger and worries already filled him up and spread from his tail to his hair. He turned his face again to leave Yae but something happened. </p><p> </p><p>Something that he never expected would happen.</p><p> </p><p>Yae grabbed Hokuto's hand and pulled him into her arms, wanting to keep him and bringing him away from Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swore he never expected the next thing that he thought would never happen between them was going to happen. </p><p> </p><p>With eyes burning in anger, Taiga pushed himself to chase after Yae who was carrying Hokuto in her arms. He swam as fast as he could to get to Hokuto. And as if the universe was on his side, he could see Yae was getting slower. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam up quickly and stopped for a moment right under the moonlight before he swam quickly and sharply down towards Yae. He flipped his body and pointed his sword at Yae who had not realized his position yet. His sharp sword stabbed Yae's tail and made her groan in pain, causing a deep wound on her gold tail close to her pelvic. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga thought attacking her once was enough, but Yae was more stubborn than he thought. </p><p> </p><p>While groaning in pain, she still tried to swim by dragging Hokuto's hand beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga gritted his fangs, growling escaped from his lips as he swam fastly while bringing out his sharp nails towards Yae. </p><p> </p><p>As he got close to her, he scratched wounds on her body, again and again as if he tried to reach the others parts. He didn't skip to dig his nail on her tail, on her back, and both of her arms. He even pulled her hair and added more scratches on her face, making her scream in pain. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga was digging deeply on Yae's cheeks and scratched it slowly and deeply, torturing her and making her scream out loud.</p><p> </p><p>"Let him go!!" Taiga spoke between his groans, he wouldn't stop torturing her until she let go of Hokuto from her arms. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga grabbed Hokuto's hand as he saw Yae's grip loosened around Hokuto's wrist. He pulled him into his embrace while watching Yae's blood spread out around and listening to her scream.</p><p> </p><p>While holding Hokuto tightly, Taiga swam closer to Yae who fell down onto the ground. He could hear her whimpers as if she tried to endure the pain from the wounds all over her body. Taiga grabbed her head, holding her crown as he stared straight into her eyes and spoke in a lower voice, threatening her.</p><p> </p><p>"If you dare to touch him again, I will never hesitate to give you more pain than what you are feeling now, even if it means killing you, I will do it. So stay away and do not ever come closer anymore. Do you understand?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam away fastly while keeping Hokuto in his arms, leaving Yae suffering alone. He didn't even care what she looked like after. </p><p> </p><p>He placed Hokuto on the ground carefully and shook his body, calling his name again and again while slapping his face. Hokuto's lips and skin were getting pale and his body felt cold.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was afraid.</p><p> </p><p>He was afraid that he would lose Hokuto. He shook Hokuto's body to wake him up, rubbing his body carefully as he tried to make him warm.</p><p> </p><p>But everything he did seemed useless.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto!!" Taiga's voice was broken. His lips and his hands were trembling as he was trying to wake Hokuto up and kept shaking his body.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, please, I beg you!!"</p><p> </p><p>
<em> For once, Hokuto! For this time, please wake up. Don't die…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's visions started getting blurred. Tears started pooling in his eyes. He had no idea what he had to do. He didn't know how to save Hokuto. His breath became short and his chest felt painful. He could only bite his trembling lips while trying hard to hold his fear.</p><p> </p><p>A single tear fell down on his scales as he looked at his beloved. He placed his hand over Hokuto's cheek as he kept calling his name softly. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto..."</p><p> </p><p>"Please.... wake up...."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga lowered his head as another tear streamed down again. He leaned down onto Hokuto's chest, letting the tears fall down from his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>As he thought that he would lose him, a miracle happened.</p><p> </p><p>He heard Hokuto's heartbeat behind his soaked clothes. It sounded weak, but it was still beating. Taiga raised his head and looked at him wide-eyed. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, can you hear me?" Taiga kept calling his name while shaking Hokuto's body. He tried to remember anything that he could use to save Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Anything.</p><p> </p><p>Anything that he knew that probably could save Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p><em> "So, we can save someone who drowned in the sea by pressing their chest, like this… </em>"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's breath hitched as he remembered Hokuto's words. He remembered Hokuto had told him how to save someone from drowning. He was just asked out of curiosity and he never thought that it would be useful this time. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga placed his hands onto Hokuto's chest, biting his lip as he looked at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Please, please, please wake up!" He said before he pressed Hokuto's chest a few times. He did exactly what Hokuto did when he taught him. And Taiga kept doing it again and again, tears were still streaming down on his scales to his chin, letting them fall onto Hokuto's clothes as he kept pressing his chest, hoping that it would work and he would see Hokuto alive once again.</p><p> </p><p>And a miracle happened.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto finally woke up. He coughed and all the water that choked him had spit out. Taiga's teary eyes widened, his hands trembling and without thinking any longer, he leaned his head onto Hokuto's chest, hooking his arms around Hokuto's body, embracing him while crying out loud.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was completely terrified that he might never see him again.</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga?..."</p><p> </p><p>"Where were you?</p><p> </p><p>"Are you alright?" Hokuto asked, his voice sounded weak.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry, Hokuto…"</p><p> </p><p>"I was swimming with those fur seals, far from my own place. I didn't know that you would come again. I'm sorry!! I'm sorry, Hokuto!" His voice cracked as tears streamed down onto Hokuto's chest.</p><p> </p><p>There was no way he could stop his tears.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto patted Taiga's head and stroked his damp hair gently. He couldn't deny that he was frightened. But seeing Taiga now beside him helped him to calm down.</p><p> </p><p>As Hokuto tapped Taiga's back gently, he felt Taiga's body was shaking. Hokuto looked down and found that Taiga was sobbing on his chest. He brought his weak body to sit slowly, making Taiga move his head but he still kept his face down. As if he didn't want Hokuto to see him. </p><p> </p><p>But Hokuto knew.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey..." He spoke gently, cupping Taiga's face and looking at him straight into his eyes. Hokuto's eyes softened as he saw how Taiga's eyes turned red, tears hanging in his long lashes, the corner of his lips were down as he sobbing hard.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto wiped the tears that fell down from Taiga's eyes before it reached his chin. He pulled him into his embrace, stroking his damp hair gently as he spoke in a very gentle voice, "it's okay, Taiga. It's okay, I'm fine. Everything is fine." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto wanted to reassure him by telling the truth that he was really fine. He was already fine. He wanted to make Taiga calm but he just made him sob harder.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looped his arms around Hokuto, burying his face on his shoulder as he cried.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga cried. He never cried before but this time he cried. He cried so hard. The thought that he might never see Hokuto anymore stayed in his mind. He was so stupid for swimming too far from his place. He was so stupid for lowering his guard and got carried away by his own feelings. He was so stupid for thinking that other sirens would never find Hokuto. He was so stupid for leaving his place. What was the point of moving to that place if he couldn't even protect Hokuto? He was completely a stupid.</p><p> </p><p>If the shark didn't tell him, he might not have met Hokuto again. If he didn't swim faster and attacked Yae, he might not have met Hokuto's alive.</p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck </em> Yae. <em> Fuck </em> everything. He didn't care. He didn't <em> fucking </em> care if they thought that he was protecting Hokuto. He didn't care.</p><p> </p><p>Because that was true. He wanted to protect Hokuto, he wanted him to stay alive. He didn't want him to get killed by other sirens.</p><p> </p><p>He would never want it to happen. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga pulled himself back and looked at Hokuto deeply. Hokuto once again wiped the tears that streamed on Taiga's face, seeing how hard Taiga cried for him only caused pain inside his heart. He was being selfish for wanting to meet Taiga again, he shouldn't have done that. Regardless of putting himself in danger, he should have thought about Taiga's feelings too. Taiga might be blaming himself at this time even though Hokuto never thought about that. It was his own fault for coming to visit him at dusk. He should have thought further that he never come at dusk, so Taiga might stay away from their cave.</p><p> </p><p>How selfish he was for thinking that Taiga would come whenever he called him. He knew Taiga loved him, of course. There was no doubt of it, but it didn't mean that he could be there for him all the time. He was being reckless for putting himself in danger, making Taiga terrified and crying because of him.</p><p> </p><p>He was so stupid.</p><p> </p><p>He shouldn't have done that. He shouldn't have made his beloved cry this hard for him. He shouldn't have made Taiga worried about him. He was the one who was responsible for his own safety. He shouldn't have made Taiga blamed himself. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto's eyes softened as Taiga cupped his cheeks and looked at him deeply. Hokuto felt like he knew something just by looking at Taiga's eyes, but he refused to think about it. </p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto..." Taiga called him softly, so soft that Hokuto barely heard him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't want this thing to happen again. It was enough. This time was enough. He didn't want to see Hokuto in danger. He didn't want to see him dying. He would protect him properly this time. </p><p> </p><p>"Don't come to see me again..."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto felt like he had stopped breathing. His eyes widened in surprise, looking confused at Taiga. The rageous waves among the wind behind them became unheard.</p><p> </p><p>Everything felt like it had stopped. </p><p> </p><p>"Wait, what…” he took a breath, “w—what do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"Taiga, I'm…" he took a gulp before he continued, "Taiga, I'm fine, I'm okay, believe me! I made a mistake by visiting you at dusk and thinking that you wo—..."</p><p> </p><p>"No, no we can't. We can't meet here, Hokuto. It's too dangerous… "</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto breathed heavily as his eyes wandered over the place, trying to understand what Taiga meant.</p><p> </p><p>"But… but why?”</p><p> </p><p>“I won't do this again, Taiga. I promise I will only come to visit you in the morning, we can spend our time like usual."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head, making the younger look more worried.</p><p> </p><p>"They know…" Taiga spoke in a very soft voice, almost whispering, "they know, Hokuto and they will never stop hunting you. They will catch you again if they have a chance." And Taiga would never give them any chance to do that to his beloved human.</p><p> </p><p>"Please do not come here again."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto grabbed Taiga's hand, his heart started racing in worry, his brows slightly furrowed, and eyes locked on Taiga's, "but I want to see you..." he spoke half whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swallowed hard the lump in his throat as he held back his tears. He placed his other hand over Hokuto's, holding it tight, telling him without words that he felt the same. He lowered his head as he blinked to sharpen his vision, a single tear fell down onto the sand before he continued his words. </p><p> </p><p>"I promise we will meet again…" </p><p> </p><p>"I promise..." Taiga looked at him deeply, saying those words more to himself than to Hokuto. He held Hokuto's hand tightly and brought it closer to his lips, trying to reassure him by planting a soft kiss onto it. </p><p> </p><p>"Let's go back."</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swam under Hokuto's boat, not wanting to let him go back alone after what happened earlier. He left his radar active, being constantly alert around him. </p><p> </p><p>The moon was covered by clouds, making the sky completely dark. The night felt colder and the wind blew strongly towards them. Hokuto buried his face on his scarf. The blanket that had never been touched in his tent, now he used to wrap himself. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto looked down beside his boat, trying to see if Taiga was still there and was he fine or not. He couldn't stop thinking about what Taiga told him earlier. It was true that he was scared that he might get caught again by them, but what about Taiga? What would happen to him if they found out that he was trying to protect him? What would happen to Taiga if he wasn't there? What if they attack him instead? </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto had been blind all this time. He didn't even think that Taiga might be in danger as well. He knew that humans were supposed to be their prey, but what Taiga did was the opposite. Taiga broke his fate as a siren by staying with him. If other sirens found out about it, they might have attacked Taiga as well.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed as he lowered his head, feeling the heaviness all over his body. His heart hurt. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was really the right thing to stay away from Taiga for a while.</p><p> </p><p>For Taiga’s sake, for them.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga watched Hokuto get off his boat, hanging his bag on his arm and walking away. Hokuto turned his body facing Taiga, looking at him for the last time. He could see Taiga's eyes softened when their eyes met, and Hokuto could see how Taiga felt just by looking into his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>His heart squeezed. Not only because he wouldn't meet him for a while, but also what would happen to Taiga if he went back to his own place. Deep down, Hokuto really wanted to take him with him, keeping him safe in his arms without thinking about anything else.</p><p> </p><p>But at the same time, he didn't want to be selfish and make more trouble for Taiga. It wouldn't be that easy to keep a siren in a house, would it? </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed and lowered his head, feeling frustrated for everything that happened to them. He walked towards Taiga while keeping his head down, bending himself and pulling Taiga into his arms for the last time. He buried his face in Taiga's neck, breathing deeply to take Taiga's scent, wanting to keep it inside his lungs for all the time.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looped his own arms around Hokuto's neck, closing his eyes as he filled his ears with their soft breath. Taiga's heart stung, he didn't want to let the hug off but he had too. He wanted to keep Hokuto in his arms, but he couldn't.  He really wanted to be with Hokuto, but could he do that? Could they be together? Could they create more memories together?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wiped a single tear that fell down on his cheeks with his own thumb before he pulled himself away from Hokuto, looking into his eyes deeply for the last.</p><p> </p><p>It was painful.</p><p> </p><p>Indeed Taiga made a promise that they would meet again, but honestly, he really didn't know when they could meet again. He didn't even know what would happen to him after this. He really didn't know what to do.</p><p> </p><p>"You have to go, Hokuto." He spoke softly while caressing Hokuto's face. </p><p> </p><p>"Promise me, Taiga..."</p><p> </p><p>"Promise me that you will be fine." Hokuto spoke as he cupped Taiga's cheeks, bringing their forehead closer.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga gave a slow nod as he placed his own hand over Hokuto's, "I promise."</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto landed his own lips on Taiga's, giving a long kiss, a long and soft kiss that was full of tenderness, love, yet longing and pain. A long kiss that asked for a promise. A long kiss that asked for hope. A long kiss that told how he felt that night. </p><p> </p><p>Their lips touched without moving for a moment, and none of them wanted to break it. </p><p> </p><p>But they had to.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga watched Hokuto’s back walked away. He kept his eyes on Hokuto, watching him alone on the shore, letting the wind of winter night touch his skin. Taiga swam down, going back slowly but not that far from Hokuto's place. He didn't want to leave, he didn't want the same thing to happen. So Taiga stayed.</p><p> </p><p>He stayed overnight under the sea, remaining alert without rest. The moon had come back, emitting its light through the sea. Shining brightly until the sun took its place. His tail flowed on the water. He kept himself alert, not wanting to let his guard down again this time. He had been staying for hours, until he looked up, seeing a glimpse of sunlight above him.</p><p> </p><p>It was already morning and nothing happened. Everything was going well as he hoped. </p><p> </p><p>He was going to stay under the sea, keeping himself close to Hokuto but something popped up in his mind. If he wanted to stay longer, he needed to find a place to hide. So he flipped his fin and turned around, swimming away to find a place for him to hide. He swam further from the shore, but still far from the cave. Taiga didn't want to go back to their cave nor his place. He didn't care if other sirens would look for him. He just wanted to stay close with Hokuto. He was afraid Hokuto might go again to see him or they would find him again. So he stayed. He stayed behind the forest sea, surrounded by the green seaweed trees.</p><p> </p><p>He was staying for a night, but then he stayed over and over again. He hid all the time. From the night where the moon's light shone brightly until it got replaced by the sun. From the waves that felt strong and had become steady. From the water that was originally cold and had become colder. He stayed all day, all night, without food and without rest. He never let his guard down, feeling afraid that he would miss any threat around.</p><p> </p><p>He was completely alert that he didn't even realize his own condition. His tail had reached the ground, his eyelids felt heavy, and his body felt weak.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had reached his limit.</p><p> </p><p>His body couldn't take the cold from the water any longer, his stomach groaning loudly, his head spinning, and then everything was blacked out.</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Taiga opened his eyes slowly. The sun rays penetrated through his long lashes, making him shut his eyes again. Taiga laid his hand beside him, placing it onto the soft wet surface. He opened his eyes again and looked around. The sound of waves crashed the rock and the strong wind mixed among them filled his ears. The wind blew towards him gently. The sun shone brightly and surrounded by the clouds above him.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn't under the water, but he was on the shore.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga brought his body to sit and looked behind, his eyes widened as he spotted a wide mouth cave in front of him; the same cave where he and Hokuto used to meet.</p><p> </p><p>How could he arrive at this cave? How about Hokuto? What happened to him?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s blood started running in his veins and his breath became unsteady. His heart started racing in worry and his head started spinning again. Taiga was going to drag himself off the shore, but someone’s voice surprised him and made him stop.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You woke up?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his face to find its voice, “Mr. Kame?”</p><p> </p><p>“W—... what are you doing here?” he asked, feeling confused.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> You lost your consciousness, I carried you from the sea forest till here </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked repeatedly, his brows slightly furrowed as he tried to remember what happened to him, but he couldn't.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga shook his head and said, "I don't have time for this. Thank you, Mr. Kame but I have to go!” Taiga turned his face away and dragged himself off the shore, ignoring Kame who kept calling him.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Taiga, they won't catch him!!"</em></p><p> </p><p>Taiga stopped.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “He’s safe in his world. They won’t hurt him, trust me!”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his face towards Kame and asked, "but what if they find him?” Taiga tried to hold his voice from shaking.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “They won’t, sirens will never touch humans in their own world, you know that. If you are still being stubborn, you are the one who puts yourself in danger.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clenched his fist and caused the sand beneath him to fall into his grasp, gritting his teeth while holding back his emotions. He didn’t mind if he had to put himself in danger, if it was for Hokuto. As long as Hokuto is safe, he wouldn't mind it.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga tried to move his body off the shore, but the next words that escaped from Kame hit him like a rock. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Do you want him to get killed again?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “If you go there and other sirens see you, they might haunt him. They might call him and make him go to the ocean and kill him."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> "Do you want it to happen?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga lowered his head, his lips trembling as he tightened his fist. Anger rushed in his blood over his body.</p><p> </p><p>“No...” Taiga’s voice cracked, a single tear fell down from his eyes, "of course not… "</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Then stay here.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Taiga dragged himself back to the shore and took a seat beside Kame. He kept his head low, not wanting to show how pitiful he was. But Kame knew, he knew how hard Taiga tried to look strong.  He knew how long Taiga stayed all night and all day without food and rest. He knew how hard Taiga fought himself so he wouldn’t get tired.  He knew how scared Taiga was. He knew it. Kame had been watching him since Taiga carried Hokuto out of this place. </p><p> </p><p>Nah. The truth was Kame had been watching them since the first time they came to this cave. Technically, he was already here for years, they were the one who came to this cave. Thinking that no one was there except them. Well, it was difficult to predict where Kame was though. Or maybe Taiga was just too occupied with Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Kame didn't have any intention to look at them at first, but Taiga and Hokuto took his attention. Especially since Taiga was his friend for many years. </p><p> </p><p>Kame the turtle, had been living while believing that every creature in the world was strong in their own way. Including sirens, they were one of those strong creatures. They were strong because they were known as sadist hunters and they had no mercy when they met their prey. Taiga was indeed the most sadistic siren in the ocean, but Kame also believed that every creature had weakness inside them.</p><p> </p><p>And Hokuto had become Taiga’s weakness.</p><p> </p><p>Kame had been living for more than one hundred years but he never saw any creatures that loved each other as much as Taiga loved Hokuto and vice versa. This thing could be their weakness, but it could be their strength at the same time. But Taiga still needed to learn more about it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What are you feeling?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sighed and looked down at his tail, biting his lips to hold him from shaking. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid...”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid I’m the one who caused him to be like this.“</p><p> </p><p>Taiga digging his nails on his own fingertip, punishing himself. </p><p> </p><p>“If we didn’t meet that time…" Taiga choked his own voice, swallowing the lump that grew in his throat, "If… I just killed him that time, we might never be like this.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wiped the tears that fell down his scales, he bit his own tongue to hold himself from crying.</p><p> </p><p>The winter wind blew towards him, bringing the noises through his ears, eating the silence around him. </p><p> </p><p><em> “But can you do that?” </em>Kame replied after a while. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked away, a soft whimper escaped from his lips. He shook his head slowly while covering his eyes, “no...” his voice shaking.</p><p>“Of course I can't…"</p><p> </p><p>"I will never be able to do that… ever." Taiga wiped the pool of tears on his eyes, not letting them fall again. </p><p> </p><p>Because it was true. No matter how many times Taiga thought about it, he could never kill Hokuto. Hokuto had taken his heart since the first time they met and Taiga didn’t have any strength to fight. It was confusing at first, but he understood now. It was clear that he had been falling in love with a human named Matsumura Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe the real reason he called him was because he wanted to see him.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe… </p><p> </p><p>"<em>It might be your destiny, Taiga. Meeting him and falling in love with him might be your destiny</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at Kame beside him. His eyes stung because of tears.</p><p> </p><p>“But we’re living in a different world...” He spoke softly, choking back his sadness that rose in his throat.</p><p> </p><p>“He can’t live here because it would be dangerous for him, and I can’t stay with him in his world because I am a siren!” Taiga let the tears streamed down his cheeks, he was exhausted to hold them. The pain inside him only squeezed his heart harder. It didn't matter if Kame thought that he looked miserable. Because that was the truth. </p><p> </p><p>It was painful, it was difficult to deal with. </p><p> </p><p>It felt… unfair. </p><p> </p><p>“If... If there is a way that could make us be together in the same world, anywhere we can be,  I will take it. I will take anything as long as I can be with him and make him safe. I don’t want this thing to happen again, I don’t want to see him in danger, I want to protect him. I want to stay beside him.” Taiga choked his own voice and took a deep breath to calm himself. A heavy breath escaped from his lips, his blood started running slowly in his veins and all the nerves in his body had loosened. He finally could feel the tiredness over his body.</p><p> </p><p>After everything Taiga said, Kame the turtle remained silent beside him. He only came closer towards Taiga and touched his tail with his own shorthand, as if knowing what Taiga really needed; reminding him that he wasn’t alone.</p><p> </p><p>The foam of waves touched Taiga's tail fin, making his body shiver. The yellow sun rays scattered around the surface water. A group of birds crossed above him, flying freely from the east to the west, probably migrated to find a warm place.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a deep breath, filling his lungs with more air while hoping there would be any space for his pain.</p><p> </p><p><em> "You should take some rest, Taiga. And feed yourself." </em> Kame said after a while.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not hungry."</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to go back to my cave."</p><p> </p><p>"<em>Why?</em>"</p><p> </p><p>"I attacked Yae. She was going to kill Hokuto so I attacked her."</p><p> </p><p>"They are probably looking for me now."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga sighed, "I don't mean to escape from their punishment though, I know what I did and if they want to punish me, I don't care."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a gulp before he continued, "It's just… I'm afraid that I won't be able to see Hokuto anymore…"</p><p> </p><p>The sound of waves crashing the rock became unheard as he saw a crab walk towards him, passing him a message that he had been expecting to hear.</p><p> </p><p>"<em>King Jesse wants to see you, Kyomoto.</em>"</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>As he expected, a lot of sirens had been waiting for him under the ocean. They looked at him bitterly while whispering to each other. He swam through them, ignoring all their bashing mouths on him, not wanting to know how they stared at him sharply and disgustedly as if he was the worst creature in the world. </p><p> </p><p>He knew this would happen, he wouldn't be surprised if his attack on Yae spread over them fastly. He wasn't surprised if Jesse knew about it. And if he wanted to punish him, Taiga could only hope that he wouldn't be locked in a cage inside the King's palace.</p><p> </p><p>"You're insane, Taiga." Remi said in front of Jesse's palace, blocking his way so she could throw her anger at him. Taiga remained silent, he didn't have any energy to argue with her. </p><p> </p><p>"How dare you attack your own fellow!! You're insane!!!" </p><p> </p><p>Taiga ignored Remi by swimming past her into the cave. Jesse's palace was a glimmering crystal cave in the center of the ocean, there were so many stalactites of the crystal. But the palace wasn't that cold. Taiga didn't understand how this thing could work, he never asked. When he swam further, he saw a throne; a big throne glittering like a crystal ice over a flat crystal rock.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Where was him? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was going to call the king but then someone tapped his shoulder and hugged him from behind.</p><p> </p><p>"Welcome, my dear Taiga."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga held himself not to be startled by Jesse's touch. He tried to let go of himself slowly, turning his body to face him and bowing slightly before asking, "Did you look for me, my king?"</p><p> </p><p>"Oh yeah I did."</p><p> </p><p>"I've heard from them what you have done to her." Jesse said before he swam away from Taiga to take a seat on his throne. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained silent, his tail flowing for a while as he waited for Jesse to speak.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh I have got a big leg, Remi sent it to me after she hunted. Do you want it?" Jesse said as he tried to reach the food in the corner of his palace. Taiga watched him with brows slightly furrowed, feeling confused.</p><p> </p><p>"My King?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes?" Jesse turned his face towards Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>"I thought you were going to punish me."</p><p> </p><p>It was Jesse's turn to look at him in confusion before he spoke, "why would I?</p><p> </p><p>"Did you really attack her because of fighting over prey? Oh c'mon I know you're not like that."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could only blink. He knew he was Jesse's favorite, but receiving treatment by being freed from the punishment he should have was unbelievable. Maybe he should have thanked him for this.</p><p> </p><p>"It's been a long time since the last time you visited me, my dear. Come here and have dinner with me."</p><p> </p><p>Jesse, The King of The Siren with mixed black and ruby color on his tail, glimmering like a diamond among the crystal around him, his shoulders look broad, and jaw hard-shaped and a shining crown on top of his brown hair. He called Taiga just because he wanted to see him. Taiga used to visit him once or twice in a month just to have dinner because he got invited. It was the three of them at first, along with Juri and Remi but then Jesse only invited him alone. Taiga didn't know the reason until Jesse mentioned that he became his favorite. He told him that he liked how Taiga caught his prey and every strategy that he used to catch them amazed him. Taiga took it as usual at first, but then he realized how this thing gave an advantage to him. So he acted nicer to Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained silent whenever Jesse tried to touch him or stared at him with his seductive eyes and spoke to him with a voice that Jesse himself thought was sexy. Taiga didn't feel anything whenever Jesse did it to him at first, he just kept avoiding his invitations. But after he met Hokuto, he understood.</p><p> </p><p>He kept himself away from anyone and completely was alone. But now he had to deal with Jesse's eyes and touch that disgusted him again by forcing himself to sip a glass of blood that he served for him.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It's okay. He set you free and it's a good thing. You just need to do what he wants. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>"How was it, Taiga?" Jesse asked after finishing his cup of blood, reaching Taiga's hand slowly.</p><p> </p><p>"It's good." Taiga said flatly. He wanted to push Jesse away as he felt him getting closer to him.</p><p> </p><p>"My King, why is… this palace not so cold?" Taiga asked suddenly. He just said anything that crossed his mind to stop Jesse.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse pulled himself away with a disappointed look on his face. "Well, I put some magic here."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked repeatedly, "a magic?".</p><p> </p><p>Jesse nodded as he poured another blood into his own glass.</p><p> </p><p>"So you can change anything with your magic?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yup, anything I want. I can make something from it too. Do you want to see? "</p><p> </p><p>Jesse started making something from his magic to impress Taiga. But Taiga didn't pay attention at all as his mind was thinking about something. Something wild, something he needed. Something crazy that he never thought that he wanted. </p><p> </p><p>If Jesse could change anything, was it possible for Taiga if he could turn into a human? Could Jesse help him? But how was Taiga supposed to ask? He couldn't tell him that he wanted to be a human because Jesse wouldn't let him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga swallowed hard before he asked, "Can you make me be more powerful?"</p><p> </p><p>Jesse brows slightly furrowed, "Suddenly? Why, my dear? You're already great with your own power. You're the best among them."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, My King. I just think maybe it would be good if I could be more powerful. I can do something else with my voice to catch my prey. I can be better, so you can like me more."</p><p> </p><p>There was a smile on Jesse's face that disgusted Taiga more before Jesse spoke to him. </p><p> </p><p>"I already liked you more than you ever thought. You're my favorite and nothing can change that, my dear."</p><p> </p><p>"I'd love to see how you make yourself better if you become more powerful. But I'm sorry I can't help you. My magic is limited to inanimate objects only." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga lowered his head as he felt disappointment begin to well up within him, making Jesse weak.</p><p> </p><p>"But if you really want it, I think the witch can help you."</p><p> </p><p>"The witch?" Taiga asked after he raised his head, brows slightly furrowed. </p><p> </p><p>"Shintaro the witch. He lives in the deepest trench in this ocean. He can do anything and he can give you anything."</p><p> </p><p>"But he's dangerous. He would make your dream come true, but then he caused trouble afterwards. I don't want you to see him." Jesse spoke in a serious tone, looking into Taiga's eyes firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his eyes at Jesse, staring at him, seeking for any lies but he didn't find it.</p><p> </p><p>Jesse was telling the truth.</p><p> </p><p>"I won't, my king."</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p> </p><p>Taiga had been swimming for hours, going through various places and bad situations to arrive at this place to meet Shintaro the witch. The waves that Taiga was passing through felt so calm. There were no fishes around when he swam here. It seemed like the sky had also changed color to dark, but the moonlight could not be seen from under the ocean, perhaps the clouds prevented it from shining through the surface.</p><p> </p><p>As the day changed and the moonless night darkened, the situation under the ocean felt very quiet and eerie.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga activated his radar, remaining alert around him if there was a threat approaching him. Remembering how he attacked Yae but instead got any punishment, he managed to escape from it. Technically, the king himself had set him free. But the fact was not a matter because they believed that Taiga tricked the king. And now, he became the enemy of the sirens.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's tail flew beautifully above the M Trench, staring intently down as he prepared himself to face any creature that might attack him. He swam through the trench, going down into the darkness. As he went deeper, the temperature was going down. The temperature dropped more and more and the water pressure was also getting higher as he swam downwards. </p><p> </p><p>He swam further and faster to the bottom, trying to find anything that possibly was the witch's place. But he couldn't find it.</p><p> </p><p>Because of the lack of lighting, the trench was completely dark and he barely saw anything. He looked up and realized how deep he had swam.</p><p> </p><p>He couldn't give up yet.</p><p> </p><p>He swam any further until he reached the ground and saw a wider cliff in front of him. If he entered it, he might arrive at Shintaro's place. Close to the the cliff, he saw a light. Taiga assumed it was probably a fish that tried to catch its prey. Taiga swam closer but still prepared himself, ready to attack if his life was in danger. However, when they faced each other, the fish remained still with its mouth closed. Taiga stared at him sharply while hiding his sharp nails behind his tail.</p><p> </p><p>"I'd like to meet Shintaro the witch. Do you know where he is?" Taiga asked, eyes staring intently at the fish. He waited for an answer for a few moments, but instead of answers, he got attacked instead. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully Taiga was faster than his enemy. He managed to hold the fish and broke its neck, holding it tight until it died. He used its head as a flashlight. But his breath hitched as he faced a few animals — strange animals. He pointed his flashlight from left to right and met a strange octopus with a strange body part that united at the end of the tail. In front of him there was a big frilled shark with dark green eyes and a dark brown eel-like body, and on his right there was a big strange shark with a distinctive snout shape. It's elongated and flat with a protruding jaw and skinny and incredibly sharp teeth. They were staring at him, as if ready to attack.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to fight, I just want to meet Shintaro the witch. Can you tell me where he is?" Taiga said calmly, trying not to be an enemy for them. </p><p> </p><p>But they remained silent. Instead of answering, they swam closer to Taiga, surrounded him. Taiga swam back as slow as he could, so slow that it was difficult to notice. His sharp nails came out, his dark green eyes glowed, staring at them sharply and dangerously. He turned his eyes to his right, seeing a small movement of the shark. And in a few seconds, they attacked him all at once.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga flipped his fin and swam up, he managed to avoid their sudden attack. He gritted his fangs and sharpened his nails, growling escaped from his throat before he attacked them all. Taiga flipped his body and pointed his sword towards them one by one, stabbing and scratching their eyes, making them blind before he stabbed them on their neck, killing them in less than a minute. Their blood spread out, making the water change its color into red. Taiga watched how their body slowly fell to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>"Superb!!! Superb!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>"That was such an amazing performance wooooo!!!! As expected from the greatest siren ever, Kyomoto Taiga!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his tensed body to behind, gritting his fangs, staring wide-eyed and looking for the owner of the loud voice and clapping hands in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you looking for me?"</p><p> </p><p>"Show yourself!!" Taiga said loudly.</p><p> </p><p>"If you want to fight, I won't show myself. Will you attack me or not?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's tensed body loosened. He lowered his guard by hiding his nails and his fangs.</p><p> </p><p>"I won't." He replied calmly.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga watched him walking out from the dark, going through the cliff side of the narrow trench, and then showing himself with a smile etched on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>He looked completely different from what Taiga thought.</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro was a half human with octopus legs. He wore a black clothes with some diamonds scattered around and made him look glamorous. He also wore a black crown on top of his curly hair. His eyes looked sharp and beautiful and his skin was not wrinkled at all. His smile looked so innocent. </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro looked incredibly handsome.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga forgot that he had been staring wide-eyed and mouth hanging loosely if Shintaro didn't speak to him.</p><p> </p><p>"What's going on? Why did you come to me?" He asked casually while walking closer to Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you turn my tail into legs?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why?"</p><p> </p><p>"Can you?"</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro turned his face to Taiga and said, "you don't want to tell me the reason?"</p><p> </p><p>"It's not important and I don't think you have the right to know about it." Taiga answered flatly, eyes following Shintaro. </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro crossed his arms, humming and nodding while walking around Taiga.</p><p> </p><p>"I can but I don't want to."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his head towards him and asked, "what?!" </p><p> </p><p>"What? You don't have the right to be angry at me for that, right?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga clenched his hand into a fist, holding himself not to get pissed off with this witch.</p><p> </p><p>"I want to visit the human world to catch a prey."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro smirked, "to catch a prey in the human world?" he asked before walking around again, still crossing his arms. </p><p> </p><p>There was silence before Shintaro burst out laughing, making Taiga annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh forgive me. I just found it funny. You came this far and asked me to change you into a human so you can catch your prey? Seriously?" He asked him in a very mocking way. </p><p> </p><p>"Can you do that or not?" Taiga asked firmly, getting impatient with Shintaro. </p><p> </p><p>"I can, but I don't want to."</p><p> </p><p>"You!!!" Taiga frowned, swimming closer fastly to Shintaro who stood in front of him, pointing out his sharp nails on Shintaro's neck.</p><p> </p><p>He was completely annoyed by him. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm trying to be kind to you. I can just tear your body apart and make you suffer until you make my wish come true but I'm holding myself. If you piss me off, I will tear your skin right now until you beg me to stop. Do you want to try?" Taiga spoke in a very low voice, threatening him.</p><p> </p><p>"Wooooo so scary~ I'm scared~" </p><p> </p><p>"Ask nicely, beg, and I will consider granting your wish." Shintaro said firmly, staring at him sharply. Taiga gritted his fangs, swallowing hard his anger as he lowered his hands and swam backwards. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked down at the ground, trying to be polite, "please help me to switch this tail into legs, I beg you." </p><p> </p><p>Shintaro chuckled before he said, "funny, you're willing to beg and act nicely to me that you just threatened a few minutes ago just because you want to be a human so you can catch a prey. Do you really want to catch your prey or do you want to meet that man?" Shintaro said while smirking.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga remained silent. He swallowed hard the lump on his throat. He could see Shintaro was a great witch. It shouldn't be surprising if he knew about anything.</p><p> </p><p>"Why don't you bring him here? I can turn him into a siren. Wouldn't living in your own world be easier?"</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to."</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro lifted his brow as he said, "you don't want to?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked up and met Shintaro, "our world is dangerous and cruel. Even though he became a siren, his life wouldn't be easy if he came here."</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think their world is safe? You have no idea how cruel there is, don't you? Not to mention you have to adapt with their habits, food, and meet other humans too."</p><p> </p><p>"It's better for me to adapt in his world rather than him to adapt in my world."</p><p> </p><p>There was silence before Taiga saw Shintaro smirked and said, "you really love him, huh?"</p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I will grant your wish!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes widened and his heart skipped a bit in anticipation mixed in happiness.</p><p> </p><p>"But I have one condition for you."</p><p> </p><p>"What is that?"</p><p> </p><p>"You have to kill the other sirens. Take their power by killing them."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's brows furrowed, "what do you mean by taking their power?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sirens have a power on their voices, I think you've already known about it, right? Take their power by killing them. The more you get, the longer you can stay as a human."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga turned his eyes as he tried to process Shintaro's words. Was that meant that he had to take their voices? If he had to take their voices, why did he have to kill them?</p><p> </p><p>"You can turn into a siren again and lose the magic to become a human if you don't kill them." Shintaro said as if he read Taiga's mind.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean I can turn into a siren again? Do you mean I can turn into a siren in the human world? So I have to kill the other sirens?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, you won't turn into a siren in their world, only when you jump into the sea, which is when you come to your own world." Shintaro said while sipping a glass of blood that came out of nowhere.</p><p> </p><p>"It doesn't make sense. If I can only turn into a siren when I come to my own world, why do I have to take their power?"</p><p> </p><p>"You will know when you become a human later."</p><p> </p><p>"Can't you just tell me?"</p><p> </p><p>A sharp and long sigh escaped from Shintaro's lips, "you're asking too much. If you don't want it, it's fine. Go home!" he said before he turned his back towards Taiga and walked away leaving him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't move as he kept thinking about the condition. Indeed, sometimes Taiga had a thought to kill the other siren, and he had threatened them once and he really meant it. But if he thought again, killing them felt cruel.</p><p> </p><p>But since when had Taiga cared about the others? They weren't even friends. He used to be alone all the time. It was just themselves who thought that Taiga was a part of them. He never thought the same thing.</p><p> </p><p>Because all the matter was just how to be with Hokuto and how to protect him. It would be difficult for Hokuto to adapt with the other sirens if he came to this world, and Taiga didn't think they would act nicely towards Hokuto. But if he was the one who became a human and came to their world, he really thought he could do it. Indeed he didn't know how the human world would be. However, as bad as the human world would be, he felt that a world without Hokuto would still be much worse. He didn't even think he could live without him.</p><p> </p><p>Killing the other sirens or what, Taiga didn't mind. He would do anything as long as he could make Hokuto safe and stay with him.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait!!"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga took a deep breath as he saw Shintaro stopped. He clenched his hand into a fist and took a gulp before he let his words out. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, I'm willing to do that. Now help me to become a human!"</p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Yae laid down on a flat place inside the sunken ship. Her whole body sore and she couldn't move. Taiga attacked her harshly without any mercy as if forgotten the fact that they were the same, a siren. Thankfully Remi was swimming around and saw her. She helped her and carried her to their place.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">Yae was going to sleep, but then she heard someone called her name. She woke up and hug him, seeking for any comfortable and affection.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"I'm sorry I failed to kill him. Please forgive me, don't ignore me." She whimpered while hugging him, stroking his arms, feeling afraid if she would get dumped.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"It's okay, you can try again later."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"But make sure that you don't fail again, or I will leave you."</p>

<p>After Taiga pulled himself off their last kiss and pushed his body gently, Hokuto merely looked at him with misty eyes. His heart already missed the warmth on Taiga's touch. Hokuto tightened his grip around Taiga's shoulders, looking at him deeply, wanting to meet Taiga’s gaze for the last time before he walked away. But Taiga averted his gaze, and Hokuto wasn't sure the reason behind it. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto dragged his heavy feet off the shore while keeping his face down. The pain and longing already gnawed over him. He turned his body facing Taiga for the last, but Taiga was already gone. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His eyes wandered all over the place, his heart screaming for Taiga's name, wanting to let it out loud but it was stuck, as if it was getting blocked by a big lump inside his throat. Hokuto rubbed his eyes with his arms, washing away the tears before it could fall and wetting his face, then walked away. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The door knob was being pulled and opened as Hokuto stepped in. The click sound of the door was heard as he closed it. The cold from outside started wrapping him tight, making him shiver. Hokuto gritted his teeth as he peeled off his shoes and placed his bag on the entrance. He looked up and realized that his house was completely dark, cold, and empty. As if it described his heart at the moment. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto dragged his feet through the wooden floor, passing through the kitchen. He took a quick glance over it and saw a wrapped-bowl on the dining table. Probably Kochi cooked something and left it for him. He must have complained if Hokuto didn't eat it. But Hokuto had lost his appetite.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The lavender scent wafted from his room as he entered. Hokuto looked at the bedside desk and found that the candle had gone out. The gleam of the light across his house peeked behind the curtain, wanting to lighten the dark room. He threw himself on the bed, laying his chest onto the navy sheets as he stared blankly at the window. The wind seemed to be raging outside as he saw the branches dancing roughly against the window. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto, and his deep love for nature would enjoy this moment. But tonight, he couldn't. His heart sank in the empty room as if he was drowning into the deep ocean without lights and being alone. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Deep down, his heart telling him to go back, running again to the shore, taking Taiga so he could hold him tight in his own arms while whispering a bunch of words of affection to him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But he couldn't. His heart ached, the loneliness started crept within him. Hokuto already missed him. He really missed Taiga and he wanted to be with him. But he couldn't go back. He knew he couldn't go back to that place to meet Taiga. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Not now.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>A flash memory of how Taiga cried panged him. It was such a painful sight especially when he knew the reason Taiga cried was because of him. Hokuto couldn't stop blaming himself in many ways, especially for making them choose this way <em> just </em>to keep him safe. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>A long and sharp breath escaped from his lips. Hokuto dragged his left hand and stared at his palm, as if Taiga's scent and his warmth lingered on it. Hokuto clenched his hand, locking Taiga's scent inside. He brought it closer to his lips, wanting to feel more of Taiga's warmth before he closed his eyes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He wanted to keep it longer. He wanted to keep this warmth and scent that was from Taiga any longer, as long as he could. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>At least for tonight.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The chirping sound of a bird on the branches drove Hokuto up from his sleep. He shifted his body, laid his back on the bed as he blinked slowly. He stared blankly at the white ceilings of the room as he let the sun beamed its light behind the curtain of its window, making the room lighter. He brought his body to sit before he grabbed his phone beside him. Wanting to check it but ended up staring at the pic on his lockscreen. A warm picture of him leaned on Taiga’s head while smiling brightly. The smile was only on his face but he could see the happiness in Taiga's eyes. He still remembered how Taiga's eyes sparkled when he leaned his own head on his temple. Even Hokuto himself couldn't hide his pinked-cheeks when Taiga turned his face towards him and made him accidentally click the screen and take another pic of them before they crashed their lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>A thin and soft smile formed on his lips for a moment until reality dragged him over heels. He placed back his phone as he realized his visions started to blurry. Not wanting to let any tears fall in the early morning. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto walked to the bathroom to clean himself even though he didn't want to. If he was allowed to be honest, he didn't want to do it because it also meant that he would clean Taiga's scent off him. He wanted to keep it as long as he could.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But he couldn't go to work without cleaning himself, could he?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>A piquant savory scent of food spread over the whole room as Hokuto walked out of his bedroom. He reached the kitchen counter and took a glass of water in silence, not even taking a look at what Kochi cooked behind him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Oh, you woke up?” Kochi greeted him while stirring a pot. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I’m making miso soup. Have breakfast before we work.” He continued with a forceful tone, as though he knew that Hokuto didn't want to eat at all. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto had zero appetite but if he left without touching any food, it looked like he didn't appreciate Kochi’s cooking and Kochi would complain about it. His mind was already tangled and Hokuto didn't want to make it even more tangled by listening to Kochi’s complaints, so he chose to stay by arranging the table. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto lived in a small apartment and Kochi had been staying with him for the past months. Both of them are tidiness and crazy about cleanliness. So it didn't bother him and he felt thankful because Kochi helped him a lot. Although Kochi sometimes liked to tease him and annoy him. But Kochi was the one who had been taking care of him especially since his father passed. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The only thing that mattered with Kochi being there with him was just that he could be a thoughtful person. Kochi knew whenever Hokuto was feeling down or hiding something. He wouldn't ask but he knew. Because there would be a time when Hokuto would spill his thoughts or feelings to him. But this time, even Hokuto himself didn't know when the time would come.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I didn't see you coming last night.” Kochi said as he sipped a spoonful of his miso. Hokuto remained silent as he kept forcing himself to eat a piece of onigiri that Kochi also made earlier. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I didn't see you either.” Hokuto replied flatly.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Of course you didn't, you had slept.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto took the last bite of his food before he spoon the miso onto his mouth. Ignoring how Kochi stared at him. Probably realizing how puffy Hokuto's eyes were. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He finished everything forcibly and bid Kochi goodbye as he walked ahead to the office. At this kind of time, Hokuto needed to busy himself or he would drown into his longing and loneliness. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Work.</p><p>Work. </p><p>Work again.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Only work that could distract Hokuto’s mind from Taiga. He deliberately arrived early, spending time in his lab before moving to his own desk to finish the other work—including some work that wasn't even in a hurry.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto had finished a pile of reports that needed to be written, a bunch of samples that needed to be measured in many parameters, and some files that needed to be cross check-ed. Everything he could do, he would do it. Everything he could finish, he would finish it. He came home late with a tired body and mind, then he threw himself onto the bed after cleaning his body, hoping that there would be no time for loneliness or emptiness to greet him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto knew he wasn't supposed to be like this. But he didn't have any strength to suppress the longing within him. His heart was swollen. A hundred times of thought to come to Taiga crossed his mind. A pool of desire within him asked him to go and meet Taiga, holding him tight and sharing the warmth between them. Showering him with the affection and love that had piled up in his heart, and gave all the attention he held only for Taiga. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>However, the picture of Taiga sobbing made him refrain from doing that. His heart squeezed, hurting him that he didn't even know which was more painful, seeing Taiga sobbing because of him, or suppressed an endless longing that enveloped him tight. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>And because of the overwhelmed feelings that spread over his veins, the work that was able to distract him seemed to no longer be useful. He didn't even know how long he had been doing this. He only knew it started to feel exhausting. He didn't want to count the days. He didn't want to know how long the longing had been nesting in his heart. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Until Yamada came and woke him up. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Eh, Matsumura-san?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Yamada asked, completely baffled. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto looked up from the white screen from his computer, looking dazed. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Ah… um… I—...” he muttered, utterly bewildered after realizing that the report was still untouched.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Matsumura-san, is everything alright?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto froze for a moment. His defensive walls seemed like they were going to collapse after hearing it. But he managed to hold it by blinking rapidly, clearing his throat and bringing back his focus.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I… uhm.. I'm good. It's okay.” Hokuto replied while forcing a smile. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Yamada looked at him in concern, which made Hokuto freeze on his seat. He then took a seat beside him and said, “Matsumura-san, I'm so grateful you want to help us to do this work. But we don't want you to overwork too. You've been working for weeks and it's New Year’s eve. You haven't even taken a proper rest. I don't mean to be rude by saying this, but you look exhausted. Please take some rest.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto was merely silent as he lowered his face. He felt grateful that his workmate cared about him. But at the same time, he felt ashamed and pity towards himself. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Christmas or New Year or whatever it is, it didn't mean anything for him if he was alone. He had been like this for years, especially since his father passed. Hokuto never wanted to grow any plant of hope to celebrate these days happily.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But after he met Taiga, without him realizing, these moments had become one of things he had been eagerly waiting for. He had been imagining himself spending his time with Taiga, under the gleaming of moonlight with the stars twinkling and scattered around the sky. He would cherish every moment he had between each other. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But Taiga wasn't here and he couldn't meet him. So what was the point of him being eager about it?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto missed him so much, so much until it felt painful. He just didn't want the loneliness within him to take him over, dragging him into the dark hole with a bunch of feelings that he hadn't figured out yet. It hurt. He felt empty. Longing endlessly within him made his heart swollen and numb. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>That was why he kept working even though the weight of exhaustion was already tying his system tightly.  </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“It's okay. I'm happy doing this, don't worry. Thank you for your concern, Yamada.” Hokuto said as he smiled politely.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The gleam of the moon reflected off the ocean and the twinkled stars above the sky scattered around made the night sparkle. The sound of snowflakes falling on earth made the night even more beautiful. The street that used to be crowded these days, it had felt empty. Perhaps everyone was spending their time as they should. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But here Hokuto was, walking down the street alone. He looked down, watching how his feet moved heavily to step on the asphalt. The night winds blew harshly as if they were howling, filling Hokuto’s ears. But Hokuto kept his step slow, walking alone through a quiet street that was usually busy in the day, as if he didn't want to arrive at home soon. Even though the cold of winter bit his bones, wrapped him tightly in a feeling that he couldn't even express. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Taiga has settled in his mind and his heart. Hokuto didn’t even know how many times he thought about him in every single thing he did. <em> What's Taiga doing? Is he fine? Does he eat well? I wish Taiga was here, I want him to try this. I wish Taiga was here, I want him to wear this, he might look cute. I wish Taiga could see me wearing this. I wish Taiga was here, he would love this. Taiga wouldn't like it if I dressed like that… bla bla bla bla </em>even in the small things he saw when walking alone through the crowded street, his heart and his mind would remember his beloved. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>No matter how many times Hokuto walked past the beach, his eyes were always looking towards the vast blue ocean. His heart yearned for the figure of his lover that he really wanted to meet, and his soul screamed a name that owned his heart. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The emptiness inside him due to the absence of Taiga's figure had made his longing become even more piled up. Every time he fell asleep, he would dream the same dream. The same moment when he and Taiga spent their night together in their cave. Curling into each other's arms, sharing the warmth between them, listening to each other's heart beat. A soft breath that Hokuto heard whenever Taiga fell asleep that sounded like a lullaby, making him fall into comfort deeper and deeper. Taiga's mesmerizing figure in his arms when he fell asleep, and the strands of hair that fell over his long lashes only made him look more beautiful. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Everything felt so real. Hokuto could feel it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But then the same thing that made Hokuto realize that it was just a dream came to hit him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>They didn't share their futon, or slept around the sound of waves at night, or under the ceilings of stalactites in the cave.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But under the same blanket, a navy blanket over a fluffy bed and Taiga as a human. They shared the same pillow, in a room that Hokuto knew as his own. The moonlight that sometimes peeked through the window behind its curtain added to the beauty and comfort between them who listened to each other's heartbeat in their embrace. Hokuto, who was in a deep sleep, would wake up because of the soft touch of Taiga's lips that landed on his chin. Taiga’s eyes sparkled while he looked at him gently with a gaze full of love and affection. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But unfortunately, every time Hokuto greeted him, or when he heard the gentle voice that escaped from Taiga’s lips when calling his name, Hokuto would wake up from his dream—his sweet dream. Facing the cruel reality when Taiga was not there, he wasn't by Hokuto’s side. It was just him alone, in the quiet, cold, and suffocating room that was full of longing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You woke up?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto opened his eyes and saw Kochi who sat beside him. He rubbed his face on his pillow, wiping his tears that streamed down from his eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Why are you here?” Hokuto asked as he brought his body to sit.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I heard you muttering something, I thought you weren't feeling well.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto merely looked down, clutching his sheet as he bit his lower lip, holding back his sadness.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You looked so happy in these past months, and then you've become so gloomy. I've been holding myself not to ask because I don't think you want to talk about it. But seriously, Hokuto. What's going on?" Kochi asked with concern shown in his eyes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But Hokuto didn't say anything. He kept his face down. He wasn't ready to tell, he thought. Kochi sighed and tapped Hokuto’s shoulder, “It’s okay if you don't want to talk. Just remember that I'm here for you,” said Kochi before he stood up and walked away. As the door knob was pulled, Hokuto spoke. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I… ”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Kochi turned at him while his hand was still on the door knob as he waited for Hokuto to continue.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But the next word that Kochi heard from Hokuto was completely surprising to him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I have a boyfriend."</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“So, this siren that was going to kill you has become your boyfriend?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto let out a long sigh before he spoke, “I told you he didn't mean to kill me.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto knew his story sounded like a fairytale as he saw how Kochi looked stunned to speak. But that was the truth. He knew Taiga never wanted to kill him. The fact that he saved his life was enough to prove it. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“May I ask you something?" Kochi asked suddenly. Hokuto nodded as he looked at his friend.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Do you think you're in love with him because he's saved your life?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto’s eyes softened as a bunch of memories of him and Taiga crossed his mind. A warm yet fragile smile etched thinly on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“At first, yes…” he replied softly. “But I realized it wasn't that kind of love."</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto took a deep breath and exhaled it before he spoke again, “It was the first time I met a siren and his look really amazed me.” Hokuto stated softly. He looked up as his memory repeated the same moment when he met Taiga for the first time. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“His figure is really amazing…” The memory of Taiga swirled in his mind. Taiga's twinkle eyes with scales over his cheeks, the small and pretty lips, the bridge of his nose that looked sharp but beautiful. His long lashes with sea water droplets stained on them, sparkling beautifully when the sun shone on him. Taiga's visual beauty really hypnotized Hokuto and made him forget about the world around him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I really liked the beauty of him.” Hokuto lowered his head again as his cheeks tinted in pink and a thin smile formed on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“But then I feel like… we've connected in a way that I still don't understand until now. I couldn't wash the thought of wanting to see him again and again. I didn't know him back then. I only know he saved my life yet I feel like I've connected to him.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto looked at Kochi and saw what his friend's face looked like.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>"Weird, isn't it?” He said as a forced smile formed on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>"Then we confessed our feelings, being honest to each other, and things were going well, so well that we spent our time together a lot. Thank you for letting me bring your camping stuff. ” Hokuto said with a smile that still didn't reach his eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto kept his face down as he spoke, “he’s so lovely and sweet. He cares about many things without him realizing. He's… brilliant. I always find how cute he is whenever he is curious about something. He is just… so beautiful in many ways and I—” Hokuto looked at Kochi who smiled warmly at him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“You're in love with him.” Kochi finished Hokuto’s sentence. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto nodded as a thin line formed on his lips, “I'm in love with him…" </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He's completely and deeply in love with Taiga. He's in love with Taiga because it was Taiga. Everything because of Taiga and only Taiga. His sweet behavior, his little attention, his sincere gaze, his soft and loving way of speaking, and the beauty within him. The way he healed and filled Hokuto's wounded heart. Everything about Taiga. His love grew because it was Taiga.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto had become so enamored with Taiga. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto had completely fallen in love with Kyomoto Taiga.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>He was completely in love with Taiga until it felt suffocating when he didn't see him. Spending days without Taiga by his side felt empty. Frustration held him tightly. Hokuto felt miserable.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto really missed Taiga. He missed Taiga's gentle touch on his fingers. He missed Taiga's soft spoken voice, he missed Taiga's gentle gaze when they spent their night under the same futon. He missed Taiga's sparkled eyes when he ate his cook. Hokuto missed Taiga so badly. He really wanted to see him, he really wanted to hold him. He really wanted to be with him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hopelessness and frustration began to spread through his body, entering the space of his heart, suffocating his chest. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I really want to see him. I really want to go back to that place. If that cave is dangerous, then I would take him with me and live here.” Hokuto lowered his head, clutching his blanket tightly as the pain strangled him strongly. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“But then another thought came to hit me. I'm worried it would be difficult for him to stay here...”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“But at the same time, I also wonder, do I really think it's difficult or is it just me who doesn't want to be in trouble because of keeping a siren inside a house.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto tightened his grip on his blanket as frustration choked in his throat.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“And I can't stop questioning myself, am I doing the right thing? Is this right by obeying Taiga's request, putting aside my ego to be with him? Shouldn't I try harder to find a way for us to be together?” Hokuto's fingers turned white from the tight grip on the blanket. As if holding back the feelings that were already unbearable within him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Do you really think so?” Kochi asked.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Do you really think that you don't want to be bothered by keeping him inside your house?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto kept lowering his face. He bit his lips as tears started brimming again in his eyes.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Look into your heart, do you really don't want to be in trouble, or you just care about him so much that you don't even want to separate him from his world?"</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto wiped a single tear that fell from his eyes as fast as he could before Kochi could see it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Because the Hokuto that I know would be the second one, you care about him so much. You don't want to push him to adapt here, in our world. Am I right?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto wiped another tear that streamed down his face. But this time, he failed to wipe it before Kochi saw it and Hokuto didn't have any chance to hide it anymore. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“To tell the truth, I don't really mind him as a siren. Like I said, I'm in love with him and I love him as he is. I'm willing to visit him like I used to do.” Because it was true. Hokuto would visit him again and again even if it was dangerous. Even if it took hours. He would do it.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Because Hokuto just wanted to be with Taiga. Spending his time with him, holding him in his arms. In their cave or in the bed like his dream, anywhere would be fine as long as he could be with Taiga. Hokuto knew it was his selfishness. But being selfish for a precious thing would be allowed, wouldn't it?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>But then the moment when Taiga cried would come in sudden, smacking him hard with guilt. And whenever he remembered it, his heart also felt like it broke into pieces. He couldn't deny what happened to him was terrifying. But the probability of him not seeing Taiga anymore was more terrifying.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>A long sigh came out of Hokuto’s lips before he spoke with a soft voice, too soft, almost fragile. “I'm afraid something happened to him and I can't meet him anymore.” Because no matter how hard Hokuto tried to be positive, he couldn't wash away the reality about him and Taiga living in a different world. Especially after knowing that the other sirens knew about him. There was a possibility of them finding out about him and Taiga. What would happen to Taiga if they knew that he broke the fate of them, that humans were supposed to be the siren's enemy, not friends or lovers. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“If you two really mean to be each other, you will be with him again. In many ways that we never expect, Hokuto.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Like a fairytale…” Hokuto said as a bitter smile formed on his lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Who knows that a fairytale would come true?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto looked up at his friend, finding solace by hearing Kochi’s words. His eyes softened, the corner of his own lips slightly dropped as Kochi gave the last tap on his back while saying, “everything will be fine.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Everything would be fine. Hokuto wanted to believe that. Him and Taiga, wherever they were, everything would be fine. His heart would never stop whispering Taiga's name, wishing him to be fine. Hoping him to be here with him when he opened his eyes. Dreaming about them sharing their love and affection. Spending their days and nights in each other's embrace. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto wanted to believe that everything would be fine. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Alright, you need some rest. Sleep now." Kochi acted as if he was telling a little brother. Hokuto let out a soft chuckle as he saw Kochi stood up and walked out.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Thanks, Kochi.” Hokuto spoke as Kochi stood up in the doorway.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“To always be here for me.” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>A soft thin and genuine smile that etched on Hokuto’s lips faded as he saw what kind of face Kochi made. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Are you trying to be romantic with me?” Kochi said, a hand on his chest, looking shocked but obvious in a joke. A thud sound popped up in the room as Hokuto threw a pillow at Kochi, making him laugh till the floor. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Their laughter filled the room as Kochi pulled the doorknob and walked outside, leaving Hokuto alone in his room. Longing still lingered, loneliness and emptiness still wrapped his body. However, a little relief growed in a little space of his chest after he poured out his feelings. The room that was suffocating, now started to have a space for Hokuto to breathe.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The loud ticking sound of the clock filled the room. The winter wind blew harshly, scratching against the wooden window of his house. Hokuto adjusted his body and laid his back onto the bed, pulling its blanket up to his chest. He stared blankly at the ceilings, wanting to sleep and hoping to see Taiga in his dream. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But then Hokuto took a look at the window, peeked from its curtain from afar, seeing how the branches danced roughly. Hokuto shifted his head, facing the wall before he shut his eyes. Hoping his dream would come true, to have Taiga in his arms when he woke up. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The winter wind blew erratically, creating a noise all around as if they met and mingled. As if competing with the sound of laughter from children playing nearby. The sun emitted its radiant rays into the ocean below. As if it tried to bury the cold that enveloped the earth. The chants of waves crashing the sand filled his ears. The scents of sea salt mixed with snow in the winter filled his lungs. Hokuto stood alone on the beach, feet drowned into the sand. His reddened face was buried in his scarf around his neck, the same scarf that he brought when the last time he met Taiga. Hokuto stared blankly at the blue water that stretched out before him. His heart screamed the same name over and over again, wanting to meet his beloved one. Or just wishing him to be fine, at least.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>The sound of children's laughter around him faded. The singing of the waves mixed with the winter breeze also sounds even more melodious. From a distance, he saw the figure of a fisherman returning from the sea, rushing towards the shore. Hokuto saw him running towards a woman standing to his right. The woman waved while smiling widely, as if she had been waiting for the figure she wanted for a long time. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Without realizing it, Hokuto locked his gaze on the elderly couple across from his right, seeing them holding hands and smiling brightly. Hokuto let himself get lost in feelings of joy mixed with bitterness. The bitterness of the fact that he wanted the same thing, holding hands with someone he loved.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto turned his gaze back to the front, staring at the waves dancing in the ocean. His eyes closed as his heart whispered the same name who owned his heart. Hoping that an answer would come from somewhere. </p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> “Hokuto…” </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Was it because the overflowing longing within him that caused him to hear Taiga's voice?</p><p align="left"> </p><p>
<em> “Hokuto… ” </em>
</p><p align="left"> </p><p>It sounded enchanting. It sounded real, so real that Hokuto himself couldn't believe it. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“<em>Hokuto… </em>”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>God, please let him see his lover.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Hokuto?”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Like an electric shock, Hokuto's eyes opened as fast as lightning. Feeling unsure whether its voice just occurred in his mind or it was just a vivid dream. His hands began to tightly grip the brown shaded coat he was wearing, trying to calm himself which was trembling. </p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto… ”</p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto's breath hitched and his grip on his coat tightened. This voice, this soft voice that he heard now felt too real if it only happened in his mind. This gentle yet charming voice belonged only to him. Only him, who was able to make Hokuto's heart melt and flutter when his name was called softly. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>This voice…</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Taiga?”</p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto!”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto really thought he might break his neck if he turned his head faster than this. His eyes caught a man who stood before him, a pale skin and long back hair reaching his neck, and a black t-shirt and short wrapped his body. His hair was gently swept by the sea breeze blowing around him. And his pale skin glow under the sunlight. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto stunned where he stood, completely enthralled by the man in front of him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>His heart recognized the alluring figure who stood before him, screaming the name he had called hundreds of times. But it didn't reach his throat. Hokuto’s voice stuck. His eyes widened in disbelief, yet amazed. Blood rushed in his veins. His heart pounded loudly as if it would burst in a few minutes. Hokuto’s breath heavily as he saw the man walking closer to him, with a face and gaze that was no less surprised than he was.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Without him realizing, Hokuto stepped ahead, step by step, slowly, while his hand reached out of its own, wanting to touch him.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto held his breath as he grabbed the reddened cheeks of someone who stood right in front of him. His eyes wandered over the figure of a man who was shorter than him. His skin was pale, cold, but still enchanted. The curve of his jaw was sharp and long, the shape of the bridge of his nose was beautiful, and his small lips looked moist and pinked. Eyes sparkled and long curly lashes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The man looked back at Hokuto with the same eyes and the same tears. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Taiga?” Hokuto spoke in a very soft voice, barely audible. He saw how the man smiled softly and his eyes showed relief and brimmed with tears. He cupped Hokuto’s cheeks gently before he spoke in the same tone as Hokuto, “yeaa, Hokuto… It's me, Taiga.”</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto let out the breath he had been holding unconsciously, his eyes were sparkling but full of tears. His heart was beating faster, his hands were shaking in joy, disbelief, and excitement. Hokuto looked down and saw a pair of long, beautiful legs standing in front of him with the soles of their feet partially sunk in the sand. He looked up again to meet Taiga's gaze, eyes widened and slightly furrowed as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>After a few moments, a radiant smile appeared on Hokuto's face. Hokuto pulled him into his embrace, wrapping him tight. Tears hanging in his eyes as Hokuto felt Taiga's hands clutched his coat. Hokuto pulled back himself gently, before he cupped Taiga's reddened cheeks. His hands landed gently on Taiga's cheeks as a light laugh escaped his lips. His thumb did its proper job, caressing Taiga's face with love. The other's fingers brushed his bangs gently before tucking it behind Taiga's ear. Hokuto's eyes wandered over Taiga's figure, still in disbelief but filled with admiration.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto then landed his forehead on Taiga's, smiling beautifully against his lips. The soft breath that escaped from the lips of the two became one, wrapping them in a warmth that Hokuto couldn't express. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I missed you so much… ” Hokuto whispered in front of Taiga's lips.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto's lips beamed as Taiga landed his own hand over his and planted a soft kiss onto his palm. “I missed you too, Hokuto. I missed you so much.” Taiga stated it in the same tone as him, making Hokuto’s heart burst. Tears of happiness could no longer be stopped and at the same time, Hokuto saw the same tears flowing gently from his lover’s eyes. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto loosened his scarf and wrapped it around Taiga's neck, locking them in the same scarf. A radiant smile etched on Taiga's pink plumed lips before it slightly parted, making Hokuto unable to hold back. Slowly, Hokuto leaned to brush his lips with Taiga's. Hands focused on cupping Taiga’s cold cheeks before he crashed his lips gently onto him. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>The soft touch of their lips came together and moved gently like waves in the middle of the sea made Hokuto's heart burst even more. The cold, moist, and salty taste of the tears that fell first made Hokuto loop his arms tightly around Taiga's waist, closing the distance between them. He wrapped Taiga tightly in his embrace. Hokuto could feel how fast Taiga's heart was beating against his own coat, making his heart pounded even more.  </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto pulled Taiga's waist closer to him again, as if there was still distance to be closed between them. He gently slipped his own tongue inside Taiga’s lips, twisting their tongues and clashing their teeth. Hokuto calmly did so without worrying about hurting himself because there were no longer fangs greeting the entrance to his lover’s lips. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto’s tongue had reached deeper inside Taiga's, licking gently the roof of Taiga's mouth, making the other moan. He then moved his hand to trail over Taiga's back, stroking it gently. Hokuto, who poured all his feelings through his kisses while closing his eyes still thought that it was just a dream. He didn't even want to open his eyes, afraid that he would wake up from his heavenly dream. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>But it wasn't a dream. Taiga was here, standing and kissing him sweetly. The sweet and addictive scent wrapped Hokuto's body tightly, filling his lungs. Taiga's milky white skin bathed in the winter sun glistened like pearls. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>A melodious symphony was created from their lips and their clashing teeth, tongues intertwined with each other. The singing of the waves kissing the sand and the whistling of the wind made the trees dance beautifully, as if they were happy seeing the two people who loved each other finally met.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto and Taiga were lulled by the world around them. The sand where they stood was like a sacred place where two people who love each other met and mingled. Hokuto's feelings were overwhelming; longing, happiness, warmth, love and affection, everything collided. Hokuto poured all his feelings through his gentle kiss. It was sweet, yet searing.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto bit Taiga's lips gently, planting the long last kiss before he pulled back, making the most beautiful sound as he smooched Taiga's lips, and leaving a web of saliva hanging between their lips. They were both panting and breathing heavily, lips swollen and pinked because of their doing. Hokuto landed his thumb and gently stroked Taiga's flushed cheek. His eyes looked deep into his love. His heart fluttered when he saw how red Taiga's lips were. And a genuine yet shy smile was clearly formed on his face when he realized he was the cause of the red on Taiga's lips. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto cupped Taiga's cheeks while giving a soft smile. Soulful eyes locked in Taiga's gaze. Hokuto landed a soft kiss onto Taiga's cheeks, the tip of his nose, showering him with lovely kisses, pouring his feelings again and again. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I missed you, Taiga…” Hokuto whispered between his kisses. He moved his lips again to Taiga's chin, slowly planting more of peck on Taiga's sharp jawline, moving again to the corner of his lips before he kissed Taiga's eyes, cupping Taiga's long lashes gently with his swollen lips, and landed the last kiss onto Taiga's forehead. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I missed you too, Hokuto… ” </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hokuto pulled Taiga into his embrace, wrapping him inside his coat as he spoke gently, “you'll get cold if you walk barefooted and wear thin clothes.” Hokuto tightened his arms around Taiga’s back, buried his face on Taiga's neck, warming him as the other tightened the grip on his inner shirt.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“I don't have any clothes.” Taiga replied half whispered as he hid his face on Hokuto’s shoulder. Hokuto tightened his embrace, pulling Taiga closer as he felt Taiga's voice shaking. </p><p align="left"> </p><p>He warmed the boyfriend’s skin by planting some soft kisses on Taiga's neck. Hokuto kept him in his embrace for a while, not wanting to let go. And then he gently pushed him, arms still looped around Taiga’s waist. Hokuto’s eyes softened as he gave a warm and radiant smile. He planted again more butterfly kisses on Taiga's cheeks, showering him a lot of affection as if their searing yet gentle kisses earlier was not enough. He gazed deeply into Taiga's eyes, the most bewitching green eyes that had become his favorite. Hands brushed Taiga's bangs gently before he spoke in a soft tone.</p><p align="left"> </p><p>“Let's go home.”</p><p align="left"> </p>

<p>Taiga’s lashes fluttered open as he felt the cold wind gently stroke his body. He blinked slowly and realized that his chest was laying on the cold beach sand. The night sky was dark, but the moon was shining brightly. Taiga brought himself to sit. His eyes wandered around, trying to figure out where he was. The place he woke up in was completely different from the last place he met Hokuto. There was no house, no boat and no one. There was only him and the sound of the waves among the night wind buzzing in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Where am I?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked down, finding how his body was covered in soft grains of beach sand without a single cloth enveloping him. He leaned his weight on his hands as he brought his body to his feet slowly. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga let his eyes trailed over his own legs once more, as though he couldn't believe himself standing upright on long, pale legs with his soles sunk into the snowy sand. His head turned around, looking for any clues of where he was, but he couldn't find any of it. It was just him alone, in the midst of the illuminated night of sparkling moonlight above him. The winter night started to crept in and wrapped him tight, making him shiver. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga tried to move his feet, dragging them out before it sunk any deeper into the beach snowy sand. He walked along the beach. The sound of waves crashed against the sand and the roaring night winter wind filled him. Taiga kept walking, ignoring the cold that stabbed into his bones. His heart kept calling a name that he had been yearning for. Hoping to meet his figure out of nowhere. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of the howling night wind grew louder. His breath heavier, his lips getting dryer, and the lump started blocking his throat, making him feel like he was suffocating in endless loneliness and frustration. Taiga swallowed hard, sweeping away the feelings of annoyance and frustration that were starting to hold him tightly.</p><p> </p><p>His body trembled, his hands and lips getting paler. Yet Taiga’s steps were getting faster. He dragged his feet as fast as he could, trying his best not to feel how cold the night wind gnawed his body. Stabbing deeper to his bones and making him freeze. Yet he kept walking. Bringing himself to walk to a place that seemed endless. </p><p> </p><p>And in his despair, a glimmer of hope emerged. His eyes caught a glimpse of light at the end of the beach from where he stood.</p><p> </p><p>A small tent with a campfire burning beside it. Taiga recognized the color of its tent as the same as Hokuto's, and his heart told him to come to him. He kept walking, as if he didn't care of his own breath that became shorter. Taiga swallowed hard as he gathered his strength to call Hokuto. But his voice stuck on his throat, it couldn't escape. Taiga quickened his footsteps, dragging his feet to walk as fast as he could, no matter how cold it was. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it might freeze him to death, he would keep walking.</p><p> </p><p>Even when his breath catched, he would keep walking. </p><p> </p><p>His throbbing heart filled his ears and his eyes sting with tears. The frustration started to gnaw over his body. Anger, pain, worry, everything collided, overwhelmed him. His breath sounded very unsteady and his feet started to freeze. Yet the tent that he saw seemed unreachable. While gritting his teeth and tugging his own nails onto his thighs, Taiga held his body and fought the winter night that enveloped him while trying to call his lover’s name. </p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto!!" His voice was shaking before it got carried away by the winter wind and disappeared in the midst of night. </p><p> </p><p>His body shivered, his breath heavier. Taiga couldn't feel his feet and both of his hands. His crown half covered by the snowflakes. Taiga really wanted to move, but his legs didn't let him. His vision blurred and his lips got paler. The gleam of light that he saw earlier seemed to scatter. His body got heavier and not long after that, everything was blacked out. Taiga fell facing down on the sand with fallen snowflakes burying his back. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The sound of birds singing cheerfully reached his ears. A sliver of sunlight peeked through the window and gently kissed his pale face. Taiga's body stirred, he then blinked slowly as the sun rays peeked between his lashes. His eyes wandered around, staring at the old wooden walls around him and trying to recognize every figure and object, some of which he had never seen before. </p><p> </p><p>But reality came to hit him hard. His body jolted as he realized about where he was, making the white wooden bed creak beneath him. Eyes widened as he found some clothes wrapped around his body. </p><p> </p><p>No.</p><p> </p><p>Not again this time.</p><p> </p><p>Why did the universe seem like it was never on his side? He was frightened by finding himself lying on the bed in a place he didn't recognize at all. It wasn't even his first time but his second time. He didn't know anyone and he didn't know where he was.</p><p> </p><p>What happened to him?</p><p> </p><p>Did he meet Hokuto? Did Hokuto take him here? Or was it someone else who found him?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga gulped as his eyes locked into the window and saw the back of a man wearing a long coat and a scarf wrapped around his neck walking past him. His heart was beating loudly until it filled his ears. He brought his body to his feet but instead of standing, he fell down. His entire body shook in coldness and fear, not wanting to see the harsh reality that he might have to accept. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga tried to reach the window hastily in front of him. His hands gripped the wood of its window tightly before his elbows rested over it as support for him to stand. He was going to shout out Hokuto’s name, but the man already turned his body to the opposite. The cold wind that blew towards him seemed imperceptible as Taiga saw the man's look. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's tensed body loosened. The corner of his eyes dropped slowly and disappointment gripped him tight when he recognized the face he saw was completely different from what his heart wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was going to go back to his bed but then something caught his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>The man he saw just now, standing just a few meters away from him, stretching his hand out as if he was waiting for someone to take it.</p><p> </p><p>And Taiga was right.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't take any longer for Taiga to see someone walking faster and grabbing the man’s hand happily. Taiga was supposed to avert his eyes off them, but he couldn't. His eyes locked on them by itself, watching how that couple smiled brightly and walked happily while interlacing their arms.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's heart squeezed.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't Hokuto, indeed. It didn't mean  that he was jealous of that man. No he didn't.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Or he did...</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He did. </p><p> </p><p>He felt angry towards them.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to be like them too. He wanted to feel it. He wanted to know how it felt to walk with someone you loved. He really wanted it to be them. Taiga really wanted it to be Hokuto who stretched out his hand and he was the one who took it. </p><p> </p><p>He really wanted it to be them, who leaned into each other’s head, locking hands and smiling happily without thinking about the other things.</p><p> </p><p>He really wanted it to be them. He really wanted to see Hokuto. He <em> really </em> wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>“You woke up?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's breath hitched as someone's voice filled the room. He turned around with eyes widened. A young lady with long-hair wearing an old coat and an old scarf wrapped around her neck appeared in front of him, standing in the doorway with a face as shocked as his. Taiga didn't realize he was holding his breath until she spoke to him. </p><p> </p><p>“I really thought you wouldn't… oh thank God. Please have a seat, I'll be back.” She said as she rushed out.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga merely stared where he stood as his mind filled with confusion and shock. The sound of children's laughter passing behind him became unheard. Taiga tightened his grip on the wooden-window behind his back as he saw her going back while holding a plate of food and a glass of water. </p><p> </p><p>“Please have a seat,” she offered him as she placed the plate onto the flat wooden bed.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s brows furrowed as he locked his eyes to her, staring in confusion. </p><p> </p><p>“I made this earlier at home when my grandma went outside. I don't know why I left some. I just thought that maybe someone would eat this but I didn't expect that you—..." Taiga kept his ears on her words as he kept his brows furrowed on his face. He listened, but he didn't know what she talked about as she kept mumbling about things that Taiga couldn't understand. He only knew that she might be someone who saved his life when he tried to run towards a tent—that he thought was Hokuto’s tent. </p><p> </p><p>But Taiga realized that it wasn't Hokuto. Probably his mind tried to fool him. Or maybe it was his own heart.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't know. He couldn't even make sure if he really saw it or not. </p><p> </p><p>The young lady kept her lips open, talking as much as she wanted. As though she didn't leave any space for Taiga to speak. Taiga wanted to ask about Hokuto, but he didn't know how to do it. He wasn't even sure if this young lady knew who Hokuto was. </p><p> </p><p>So Taiga was merely silent. He kept his words hanging on his tongue as his ears widened to listen to her. </p><p> </p><p>But this time, it wasn't only his ears that widened.</p><p> </p><p>The change on Taiga's face showed as he heard the words that came out from her mouth. He heard it clearly, yet he didn't want to believe it. So he asked again.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you say?” Taiga asked, his voice shaking, barely could be heard. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga looked at her in disbelief. His lips started to dry and words got stuck in his throat. It took a few minutes for Taiga to finally spit his words out again as he said with still in the same shaking voice.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you say?"</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"How long have I been here?”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The young lady was stunned a moment before she answered, “3 days. You were unconscious for 3 days.”</p><p> </p><p>The ticking sound of the clock that filled the room now fell silent in his ears. His body froze as he tried to process it. He did think he had stopped breathing as he felt choked. </p><p> </p><p>3 days!!</p><p> </p><p>3 days?!!! </p><p> </p><p>3 <b> <em>fucking</em> </b> days?!!! </p><p> </p><p>Taiga had been here for 3 days!!!</p><p> </p><p>It was unbelievable. There must be a mistake. It would have been impossible if he had been here for 3 days. He still didn't know many things. He didn't know where he was. He didn't know who this young lady was. He didn't know where Hokuto was. He didn't know anything about this human world. </p><p> </p><p>The worst thing was he was alone. No one knew him and he didn't know any of them either. How could this thing have happened?  </p><p> </p><p>His blood boiled in his veins and his breathing was getting heavier. Realization hit him hard. He came this far to this human world to meet Hokuto. To be with Hokuto. To spend his entire time with Hokuto. But he didn't even know where he was. He didn't know how to reach him. He didn't know how to tell Hokuto that he was here, looking for him. He didn't even know where he was, so how could he find him? </p><p> </p><p>The pain that was hiding so deep began to creep out to wrap him tight. Frustration, longing and loneliness, everything enveloped him. A big lump blocked his throat as his eyes brimmed with tears.</p><p> </p><p>Did the universe really not allow him to be with Hokuto even though he was willing to exchange his tail for legs?</p><p> </p><p>It had been three days. Three <em> fucking </em> days since he came to the human world and he still had no clue where Hokuto was. How could he survive?</p><p> </p><p>What was the point of him coming to this world?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wiped a single tear that streamed down his face. His lips trembled from the anger that boiled within him. His heart ached. And the big lump in his throat kept choking him. </p><p> </p><p>What should he do? What should he do so he could be with Hokuto?</p><p> </p><p>Taiga didn't know. He didn't have any plans to find Hokuto. More likely, he didn't know it. He was tired. He felt frustrated.</p><p> </p><p>Deep down in his little heart, he wanted to give up… </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>No..</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>No, he shouldn't have felt like this. He came this far to the human world. He had done many things to be here. He had enough frustration within him. He didn't want to give up. He wasn't supposed to be like this. </p><p> </p><p>He wanted to be with Hokuto. He wanted to spend his time with him. He needed him. He wanted him. He loved him. </p><p> </p><p>He couldn't give up.</p><p> </p><p>While catching his own breaths and wiping his tears roughly, Taiga looked around, trying to find a way out for him. And his eyes stopped at the old wooden door widely opened, the place where the young lady came to see him. Without thinking any longer, Taiga stood up and dragged his feet to walk as fast as he could, ignoring the voices of the young lady that echoed in the room. He then pushed the front door with his body and stepped out. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga continued to walk away from the old house where he fell asleep. Not once did he turn to look at the young lady who still kept calling his name. He brought himself to walk as fast as he could on the street under the winter sky. Just by wearing a short black t-shirt and trousers that only covered his knees, Taiga kept pushing himself to walk on the street which was thinly covered with snow that he didn't know when it had fallen. </p><p> </p><p>No one knew how far Taiga walked. Not even himself. He just kept running and running, he didn't even care how the others looked at him. </p><p> </p><p>The only thing he cared about was he just wanted to find where the beach was. Because the possibility that he might meet Hokuto was only on the beach. No matter how long it would take, Taiga would keep running.</p><p> </p><p>Even when his heart was beating loudly till it reached his ears. </p><p> </p><p>Even when sweat had soaked his clothes.</p><p> </p><p>Even when his eyes were already blurred with tears.</p><p> </p><p>Even when he had to catch some breath. </p><p> </p><p>Even when the blood rushed through his veins and up to his head, making it feel like it was going to explode.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga would keep running. </p><p> </p><p>He kept bringing himself to run as fast as he could. </p><p> </p><p>And his heart screamed the same name over and over again, hoping that Hokuto might appear and catch him. </p><p> </p><p>He called his name over and over again without getting tired. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga wanted to scream but his throat dried. His lips trembled. His breath was shaking. Pain that rushed through his blood now perched in his chest. Frustration within him had wrapped him tight. But he kept trying to untie its knot that was starting to feel like it was suffocating him. His heart kept screaming Hokuto’s name. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga would keep calling him until the world was on his side.</p><p> </p><p>He didn't know how long he had been walking, but the sound of waves had reached his ears. His eyes caught a familiar back figure of a man. A man with broad shoulders, curly black hair, wearing a brown shaded coat and a scarf wrapped around his neck.</p><p> </p><p>It was the same scarf as he had seen last time.</p><p> </p><p>And the man who wore it had the same figure as someone he had been yearning for.</p><p> </p><p>The figure of a man he had missed so much.</p><p> </p><p>The figure of a man he had dreamed of every moment.</p><p> </p><p>The figure of a man who filled the recesses of his heart. </p><p> </p><p>The expanse of blue sea in front of him seemed invisible. The sound of the waves and the winter wind blowing harder towards him being muted. His hands got paler and trembled. His aching legs and reddened soles became unnoticeable. His damp hair because of sweat had slowly dried. Taiga locked his eyes on his lover’s back who stood just a few meters in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>With his shaking voice, Taiga called his name. But he wasn't even sure if Hokuto could hear him or not because Taiga himself couldn't hear his own voice. Either his voice was too weak or it got washed away by the sound of the waves hitting the sand of the beach, Taiga didn't know. But he kept calling his name.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Hokuto!!!!!” </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga's breath hitched when he saw him turn around and met his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes brimmed with tears, blocking his visions. It was blurred yet Taiga was sure. He convinced himself many times that it was him.</p><p> </p><p>It was Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>It was Matsumura Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>The man that he had been missing so much.</p><p> </p><p>The man that he had dreamed of every night.</p><p> </p><p>The man that he loved with his whole heart.</p><p> </p><p>The man who owned him and his heart. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>His beloved Matsumura Hokuto. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga moved closer to reach him. His heart squeezed as he saw the same tears hanging on Hokuto’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept walking until a soft and warm hand gently touched his cheek. A single tear dripped slowly to his chin. Happiness and disbelief shown clearly in his eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>Matsumura Hokuto. </p><p> </p><p>His beloved Matsumura Hokuto stood right in front of him. </p><p> </p><p>It was no longer a fantasy. It was no longer his dream. It was no longer thoughts that deceived him.</p><p> </p><p>But a reality. It was real. Matsumura Hokuto was really standing there, in front of him. </p><p> </p><p>It was a reality that he had been waiting for a long time. It was a reality that could make his heart burst out of happiness and put him in the seventh heaven.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga let out a soft breath through his mouth as Hokuto wrapped his scarf around his neck. His trembled lips formed a soft smile when Hokuto cupped his face, eyes brimmed with tears anew. </p><p> </p><p>There was no more cold that wrapped his body, only a feeling of warmth enveloped him. The tears flowed softly as if they couldn't be stopped. Taiga caught his breath slowly as Hokuto showered him with love and affection through his words. </p><p> </p><p>A soft gasp escaped from him as Hokuto cupped his lips with his. The feelings that Hokuto conveyed in his kiss were being received well— very well. And Taiga replied to his kisses with the same meaning as Hokuto gave to him. Warmth, longing, love, affection, everything was being poured clearly into their embrace and kisses that they shared under the bright yellow sky. </p><p> </p><p>A soft moan escaped from his throat as Hokuto bit his lips, catching his tongue to intertwine with his. A gentle yet fierce kiss they shared made Taiga forget where they were. The pain and despair when he didn't see Hokuto had slowly disappeared. The pent-up longing inside him was slowly replaced with warmth. There was only happiness that slowly overflowed from within his body. </p><p> </p><p>The feeling of happiness that only Taiga could feel when he was with Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>The feeling of happiness that he finally knew when he was with Hokuto. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The unstoppable tears kept drowning his face and reached his lips. The salty-sweet taste in Hokuto's kiss felt so real. Taiga opened his eyes for a few seconds and saw the same tears on Hokuto’s eyes. Taiga clutched Hokuto’s clothes tightly. The symphony of their clashing teeth and soft moans that escaped from each other's lips filled Taiga's ears. He let himself be drawn into the feelings of Hokuto’s touch. The soft touch of Hokuto's lips moistened his lips and made his cheeks bloomed in pink. The thudded sound of his heart beating hard against Hokuto’s clothes started to tickle his ears, as if it didn't want to be outdone by the softness of the harmony created in their kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s whispers in front of Taiga's lips that told him how much he missed him, his soft and low tone that sometimes escaped from his throat, and every touch, every kiss that Hokuto planted on his lips, everything Hokuto did to him only made Taiga's heart melt even more. </p><p> </p><p><em> I missed you too, Hokuto. I missed you so much. I missed you more than you ever thought. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga told those words through his kisses and his tightened grip on Hokuto’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga missed Hokuto. And Hokuto missed Taiga as much as he missed him. They were just two people that fell in love and missed each other. It was just them enveloped in the longing for each other. They kissed, they shared the warmth in their embrace. They told each other their feelings from their touch.</p><p> </p><p>They were just two people that were completely and deeply in love.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga let out a soft breath as Hokuto released his lips from his, leaving a web of saliva hanging between their lips. His lashes fluttered open slowly as he caught a glimpse of a warm smile on his beloved eyes. Taiga let himself again drown into Hokuto's warm and soft touch on his face. He let Hokuto’s swollen and moist lips cupped his lashes, his nose, his jawline and every place of his own face that Hokuto could reach, showering him with his affections, telling him over and over that he missed him as much as he was, as if their searing kisses wasn't enough.</p><p> </p><p>Everything Hokuto did only made Taiga's heart burst even more. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga buried his reddened cheeks in Hokuto’s shoulder as he pulled him closer to his embrace, wrapping him tight in his coat. His grip on Hokuto's clothes tightened as Hokuto pulled him again, as if there was still distance between them that needed to be closed. Taiga took a deep breath on Hokuto’s shoulder, filling his lungs with his scent.</p><p> </p><p>Without him realizing, his eyes closed slowly and a single tear dropped again from his eyes, but his lips formed a soft and genuine smile. Taiga tightened his grip even more on Hokuto’s clothes when he felt Hokuto’s voice shaking on his own chest as he spoke, “you'll get cold if you walk barefooted and wear thin clothes.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga wiped his happy tears by burying his face on Hokuto’s shoulder, not wanting his boyfriend to misunderstand it before he replied in a whisper “I don't have any clothes…”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga’s eyes dropped when Hokuto pushed his body gently, his lungs already missed Hokuto’s scent, and his heart screamed because of fear that everything he felt was just a dream.</p><p> </p><p>But when he saw how soulful Hokuto’s eyes were when he locked his gaze on him, the worries in Taiga's eyes faded immediately. He held Hokuto’s hand as Hokuto landed another kiss on his face. Their soft breath mingled and caused butterflies in Taiga's heart to spread over his whole body. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga thought his heart would never burst as hard when Hokuto showered him with his kisses earlier, but he was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>The words that Hokuto spilled from his lips made Taiga’s heart burst ever more. </p><p> </p><p>“Let's go home…”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes sparkled and his heart melted in happiness. He looked at Hokuto's face which softened with a glimpse of sunlight behind his shoulders. A wide, sincere smile was clearly shown on Taiga's face as they intertwined their fingers. A subtle nod from him was enough of a cue for Hokuto to take him with him.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took off his coat and his scarf so he could envelope Taiga within it before he took a few steps ahead, bowing, and gesturing for Taiga to climb onto his back. </p><p> </p><p>"Come up," said Hokuto softly as he turned his head to the side, as if waiting for Taiga to do what he asked. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga was stunned by confusion that still wrapped his mind, yet he took some slow steps and leaned his body onto Hokuto's back with hesitation. But then Hokuto caught his thighs and his arms and helped him to loop them around his body. Taiga held Hokuto’s shoulders tightly as Hokuto up slowly. His breath hitched when Hokuto shook his body to adjust his position, making Taiga feel more comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>“Hold tight, okay!"</p><p> </p><p>With a blushed cheeks, Taiga looped his arms around Hokuto’s neck and leaned his cheeks onto his head, hugging him tight. His heart beating faster against Hokuto’s back, making Hokuto blushed even more.</p><p> </p><p>The winter breeze blew softly past them. The orange-ish sun rays scattered above them. The sound of waves could no longer be heard from the distance where they were currently walking. </p><p> </p><p>Today's weather felt a bit warmer or it was just Hokuto thought. He didn't know. He just felt the heat spread over his body especially when Taiga’s breath tickled his neck softly. Hokuto kept walking along the road, not caring about how people whispered or looked at them.</p><p> </p><p>Both of their cheeks were flushed and thin smiles were etched on their lips. Taiga tightened his arms around Hokuto’s shoulders as he buried his reddened face in Hokuto’s neck, closing his eyes as he kept filling his lungs with Hokuto’s scent. Taiga couldn't help but plant a soft kiss behind Hokuto's ear, then he moved to Hokuto’s neck, before he tried to reach for his reddened cheek. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga kept doing it over and over until Hokuto couldn't hide his flushed cheeks.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“That's unfair!”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Why?” Taiga replied while nuzzling into Hokuto’s neck, making the younger tugged his thighs gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Don't do it here." Hokuto said breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga raised his head and looked at him with brows slightly furrowed, "you don't like it?”</p><p> </p><p>“It's not what I mean. It's just… embarrassing…”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga loved seeing whenever Hokuto’s ears turned red, “you kissed me earlier and I don't think you care about what other thoughts but now you just said that it's embarrassing?” Taiga spoke half whispered. His warmth breath blew softly and tickled Hokuto’s ears, making Hokuto swallowed down while holding his shaking breath.</p><p> </p><p>Ah. Hokuto seemed nervous.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could see just by seeing him from the side but he knew how nervous Hokuto was. His ears were even redder than before. Taiga couldn't help, he wanted to tease him even more.</p><p> </p><p>“You don't like it? You want me to stop?” Taiga whispered each sentence while nuzzling Hokuto’s neck with his own nose.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a deep breath as he swallowed hard again, “no, I love it.”</p><p> </p><p>A mischievous smile appeared on Taiga's face before he pecked Hokuto’s neck. The younger had to keep his eyes wide open and send the strength to his knees or they would fall. There was no way Hokuto didn't like Taiga’s touch. He loved it. He <em> loved </em> it so much. It was just reality hitting him when he carried Taiga and how the others — who knew him well because of how kind Hokuto was to them— looked at him while smiling. Their eyes spoke to him and Hokuto could see how many questions they had and how they teased him in silence. And those things made Hokuto blushed even more. His heart might burst again if Taiga didn't stop.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga let out an airy laugh while kissing his neck gently. Hokuto was going to protest again but then those laughs slowly faded. Taiga's arms slightly loosened around his neck and Hokuto guessed that Taiga might have fallen asleep as he leaned into his nape, breathing softly. </p><p> </p><p>“Taiga?" He called softly.</p><p> </p><p>It took a few moments for Taiga to reply with a hum.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you slept."</p><p> </p><p>“I just want to breathe your scent in silence."</p><p> </p><p>A soft chuckle escaped from Hokuto’s lips, “what's that…" Hokuto mumbled to himself while blushing. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga had been wondering how long it would take them to arrive at Hokuto’s place. Hokuto's breathing, which was starting to become a little panting, made him worried. Taiga peeked Hokuto’s face from the side, asking him gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you tired?"</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled before a soft chuckle escaped from his lips, “A bit, but we will arrive soon.”</p><p> </p><p>"Am I making you slower? Don't you think it would be better if I just walked?” Taiga asked, leaning his cheeks against Hokuto’s as he looked at him in worry. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto would never let Taiga walk barefooted. </p><p> </p><p>Never again.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lighter than before. Did you eat well?”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga hid his face on Hokuto’s nape as he whispered, “I didn't…”</p><p> </p><p>As he thought. Hokuto’s heart squeezed after knowing it from Taiga's mouth. Just how long Taiga hadn't eaten that his body felt so much lighter than the last time he carried him. He wasn't even sure if Taiga ate anything after that moment. He was so occupied by Taiga's ethereal beauty that he didn't realize how thin Taiga's face was. He looked thinner and even paler.</p><p> </p><p>“I'll cook for you." </p><p> </p><p>Winter breeze blew softly towards them as Taiga raised his head, looking at his lover before he hummed, feeling unsure about what he just heard. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto took a breath, smiling gently and saying the same words again while turning his face and meeting Taiga's nose on his cheeks, "I'll cook for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's cheeks bloomed as he made a thin line on his lips. He leaned onto Hokuto’s shoulder  as he felt the warmth start to spread over his body again. The buzz wind blew through them. The noise of crowds of humans around them earlier had faded from Taiga's ears. Taiga tightened his arms around Hokuto’s neck as he wanted to adjust his body. But then he noticed something strange was happening to his feet. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?" Taiga hummed as he took a look at his feet, slightly shaking it. </p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto…” he called him softly, his eyes widened in wonder.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I can't feel my feet."</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes widened as he grabbed Taiga’s feet, checking it gently while brows slightly furrowed. His eyes changed into worry as he found how bad Taiga's soles were, bleeding and his skin was peeling off.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to hurry!”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga blinked as a sudden grip tightened on his thighs and made him gasp. His mouth was hanging loosely and his eyes widened as he felt Hokuto’s speed up, running up the hill towards his house, their house.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">▪️▪️</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Kochi!!!"</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Kochi, I need some help!!!"</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga kept his eyes rounded as Hokuto lowered him slowly, holding his shoulders tightly as he helped him walk along the wooden floor of his house. His eyes wandered slowly, looking at the beauty of the neatly arranged Hokuto house. A soft and sweet aroma that came from somewhere gently touched his nose. Some pictures Taiga had never seen before hung on the wall, refreshing his eyes. The house and everything looked foreign, but the atmosphere created within it felt comfortable for him.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's eyes then fixed on a man who walked towards them. A thin figure with tanned skin and looked a bit taller than him was looking at him in confusion. Taiga assumed that this man was probably Kochi, Hokuto’s friend. </p><p> </p><p>“Do we have any food?" Hokuto asked.</p><p> </p><p>"No, I only cooked ramen for myself. I thought you'd — wait Hokuto, who is he?”</p><p> </p><p>“My boyfriend." Hokuto said softly while locking his eyes at Taiga for a few seconds and making Taiga blushed.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga could see the change on Kochi’s face and how happy his eyes were while looking at him, his mouth widened as if the thing that Hokuto said surprised him.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Hi… ummm?”</p><p> </p><p>“Taiga." Hokuto answered for him.</p><p> </p><p>“Taiga! Yes, Taiga! Hi I'm Kochi, Hokuto’s friend. Umm are you—"</p><p> </p><p>“Keep your question for now, Kochi. I need your help. Could you please help me to prepare dinner? I need to help Taiga to change and treat his feet. Taiga, can you walk by yourself and wait for me for a moment in my room? Or do you need some help to go there?” Hokuto asked rapidly as he pointed to a room on his right. Taiga brought his eyes and found a black door on the right before he nodded and said softly, “it's okay, Hokuto. I can walk by myself." </p><p> </p><p>Taiga lowered Hokuto’s arms around his shoulder and smiled gently before he walked to Hokuto’s room. Meanwhile Hokuto hurriedly looked for the first aid kit and new clothes for his lover. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was so occupied with his own business that he didn't even realize how Kochi looked at him, standing behind him while smiling widely at his friend. But not long after that, Hokuto felt the presence of a devil staring at him. He then turned around and found a big smile on Kochi’s face.</p><p> </p><p>This is the devil, Hokuto’s thought. </p><p> </p><p>“You don't need to smile that big, help me to cook.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why? What do you want me to cook?"</p><p> </p><p>"Anything. Just… help me. Ugh I promised him to cook for him but he makes me worried. I can't leave him alone and I need to change his clothes and—... Why do you smile again?” Hokuto asked while holding the first kit, brows furrowed. </p><p> </p><p>Kochi couldn't help but smile any wider. A million sentences were created in his mind but the only one that managed to come out was, “I think it's my time to leave this house. Or I might <em> hear </em> the things that I shouldn't hear,” he said while smirking, teasing his friend.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was going to ask again but before he could do that, Kochi threw some words again towards him.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, I'll cook. But I only want to cook ramen. If you're complaining then cook by yourself. Go help him. But don't make any sounds because I can hear you two from here.” He said while smirking.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was completely flabbergasted. He didn't get what Kochi meant behind his words. And he didn't have time to think about it, so he left him alone and went to his room to help Taiga. </p><p> </p><p align="center">▪️</p><p> </p><p>“Taiga?" Hokuto called as he stepped in. He found Taiga was sitting on his bed while placing his palm over his knees.</p><p> </p><p>How cute, Hokuto’s thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Is everything okay?"</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah it's okay, don't worry. Kochi will help to prepare dinner. Let me take care of you." Hokuto placed the first kit onto the navy sheet and the new clothes beside it as he took Taiga's hand and helped him to go to the bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto told him step by step how to use the shower and how to use the honey soap that he used. Taiga listened to everything carefully and threw some questions that he didn't understand. As if they were in a class for a lesson. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, I'll wait outside. Now take off everything and take a shower. Let me know if you need some help, okay?"</p><p> </p><p>Taiga only nodded. As Hokuto walked out, Taiga called him again.</p><p> </p><p>"Hokuto, I don't know how to take this off…” Taiga said while clutching to the clothes he was wearing. Hokuto walked closer while smiling softly and helping him to pull up his t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>“How to take this off?" Taiga asked innocently while pointing at the trousers he was wearing.</p><p> </p><p>“Just pull it down."</p><p> </p><p>The soft smile on Hokuto’s lips faded as he saw Taiga pull down his pants right away. His eyes widened in surprise. And as reality hit him, Hokuto hurriedly turned his back facing Taiga. </p><p> </p><p>“P-put your clothes there and I'll take it later." He stumbled on his own words before rushing out, leaving Taiga in puzzlement.</p><p> </p><p>The spicy smell tickled his nose as he walked outside. The meaty savory smell had spread over the room. Hokuto walked closer and saw the two beautiful bowls of ramen with some tiny pieces of meat and half boiled egg placed over it. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you're done? This is the best I can do.”</p><p> </p><p>"I thought we didn't have any meat.”</p><p> </p><p>“Apparently we have, so I put them here. It's already 8 and I've helped you. Now let me stay in my room, I need to finish my game befo— why are you so red?”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto stumbled on his own words after Kochi threw a sudden question to him. His lips were hanging loosely and his mind was lost. The figure of Taiga taking off his clothes that popped up in his mind caused a mess on his body. He couldn't stop thinking of how beautiful and smooth his skin was, making it difficult for Hokuto not to—....</p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto!"</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?"</p><p> </p><p>“You're being away again. He's waiting for you." Kochi lifted his chin towards the doorway and Hokuto saw Taiga was standing shyly and cutely there. Water dripped from his long black hair to his shoulders and his body was wrapped in a white turtleneck sweater and long black trousers. Hokuto was stunned for a moment. He had seen Taiga like this many times but tonight, Taiga looked different. His beauty seemed to radiate so brightly and it felt dazzling.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga was pulchritudinous.</p><p> </p><p>The beauty of him was like moonlight shining in the dark of night. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s body moved by itself as he walked towards him. Taiga's soft voice reached his ears as he spoke, “I… I don't know if I'm wearing this correctly. And my hair, Hokuto. Could you please… help me?” </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s eyes locked on Taiga and no words came out afterwards. He was completely amazed by Taiga's beauty. His eyes now sparkled and his lips curled. Hokuto got lost in Taiga's beauty all over again, making him forget what he wanted to do. Without him realizing, Hokuto pushed Taiga's body gently to go back to his room, making him stumble on his feet. His hand swiftly held the doorknob to close it, as if he didn't want anyone to see Taiga's ethereal beauty.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s body moved by itself. His arms looped Taiga's waist and closed the distance between them. Eyes were still busily wandering over Taiga's figure. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga's innocent and mesmerizing eyes, his black hair with a water droplet flowing down his temples. His moist pink lips that slightly parted, and the soft breath that escaped from his lips. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto let out a soft chuckle as his knuckle landed on Taiga's forehead, caressing him down to his pink-bloomed cheeks. Hokuto’s lips formed a very gentle smile before he whispered, “you're so beautiful…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto brought his eyes back to lock on Taiga's. The dark green tantalizing eyes that Hokuto really admired.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I kiss you?" he asked in a very low tone. </p><p> </p><p>Before Taiga could answer, Hokuto had destroyed the distance between them by gently pressing his lips against Taiga’s.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's mind filled with surprise and confusion, but he then let himself sunk into Hokuto’s touch. His eyes shut slowly as he trailed his hand over Hokuto’s chest, tugging his clothes.</p><p> </p><p>The sounds of their interlinked tongues filled the room. A soft moan vibrated on Taiga's throat as Hokuto pulled him closer by his waist. Taiga kept his hand pressed between their chest as Hokuto trailed his hand over Taiga's body and stroked Taiga's back gently. </p><p> </p><p>The electricity spread over his body. Taiga moved his hand to loop around Hokuto’s neck. And Hokuto took the signal fastly as he pulled Taiga any closer and let their chest bumped, feeling how hard their heartbeats against each other's clothes. Hands grabbed Taiga's hair gently and some water from his hair dripped slowly between his own fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto then tilted his head, finding a better angel to catch Taiga's lips, wanting to taste the sweetness within him even more. His tongue had reached the rooftop of Taiga's mouth and made the older moan in pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Again and again, as if their earlier kisses weren't enough. As if they never kissed before. The kisses were slow, steady, full of affection and admiration, yet still passionate. Taiga smiled on their kisses as Hokuto caressed his damp hair and brushed his bangs away gently.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s touch never failed to make Taiga's heart flutter. Despite how hard it was beating against Hokuto’s chest and how fast his blood was running in his veins, Taiga still wanted to feel more. He still wanted Hokuto’s kisses even more. He still wanted to be spoiled by Hokuto.</p><p> </p><p>So did Hokuto. Everything he wanted to do was just to shower his lover with his affection and love through his kiss, his touch, his embrace, everything he had. He just wanted to spoil Taiga over and over. He wanted to enjoy their times and explore many things with him.</p><p> </p><p>And one of them was this.</p><p> </p><p><em> This </em>moment.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto wanted to explore more with Taiga as he started guiding them to his bed, wanting to push Taiga down onto the sheet and share more kisses with him. But right after he laid over him, the hard knocks on the door startled him. </p><p> </p><p>“Hokuto, your ramen will be cold. Finish your food first, then you can finish your boyfriend." </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto sighed in front of Taiga's lips as he closed his eyes momentarily. Kochi managed to annoy him this time.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you think he hates me?" Taiga asked while palming his own lips, a little concern flashed in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>"No, he doesn't. He is just annoying." Hokuto said as he brushed Taiga’s hair gently, trying to comfort him.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, let's treat your wound first, so we can have dinner.” Hokuto pulled himself back from Taiga after planting a soft kiss on his forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh wait, your hair. Let me help you."</p><p> </p><p>The sanity had dragged him back after he pulled out the towel from his wardrobe. His face turned red as he realized what he almost did to Taiga. He knew this was such a very inappropriate moment if he still felt ashamed of what he had done and wanted to do because he was the one who started it. </p><p> </p><p>But he couldn't help that he was also the blushing one among them. </p><p> </p><p>And he couldn't deny if Kochi didn't knock, he might have lost his mind completely.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold yourself, Matsumura." He mumbled to himself and sighed heavily before he walked back to his room. Meeting Taiga who sat beautifully on his bed, waiting for him to help to dry his hair.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga smiled shyly as Hokuto threw a soft smile towards him. He lowered his head as Hokuto wrapped a towel on his head and patted him, drying his hair gently. </p><p> </p><p>“You can do this to reduce the damage on your hair.” Hokuto said softly.</p><p> </p><p>"Do others do this too, Hokuto?”</p><p> </p><p>"Hmmm, maybe? I don't know.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga's moist lips formed a soft smile. He then closed his eyes unintentionally, feeling the gentleness of Hokuto's touch on his head.</p><p> </p><p>A sudden loud knock on the door echoed over the room again, surprising them and successfully annoyed Hokuto again this time. He let out a sharp breath through his nose before he threw the towel beside him, taking Taiga’s hand and walking to the doorway to face the devil— Kochi, he meant. </p><p> </p><p>“Why did it take so long? Your ramen would get cold, I've warned you.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto was going to answer but Kochi threw another complaint towards him. </p><p> </p><p>“You asked me to cook and I did this for you but you just left like that. Don't you dare to ask me again later. Did you treat his wounds? Or you just added more marks on him?” Kochi asked, definitely teasing him. “How was it, Taiga? Did he do well?" The tone on Kochi’s voice changed immediately as he asked Taiga while smirking.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga stumbled on his own words. Eyes focused on Hokuto as he asked for some help. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Kochi… ” Hokuto gulped, swallowing his annoyance. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"I'm not asking you, Hokuto."</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"Can't you just…" Hokuto took a deep breath, trying to calm himself so he could talk in peace with this dev…— Kochi.</p><p> </p><p>“I can heat it again later if it's cold. Now, could you please give me some time because I need to treat his wounds.”</p><p> </p><p>Kochi crossed his arms over his chest as he tilted his head, brows furrowed. “I don't think you would do that. Look, here's my advice, you better treat him there on the couch or you would never treat his wounds if you stayed in your room”</p><p> </p><p>Kochi really needed to close his mouth or Hokuto might explode in embarrassment. He forgot that they've known each other too well. </p><p> </p><p>“Ko—"</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, calm down. I won't embarrass you any further.” He replied while smiling widely. Hokuto, who turned red again, merely looked at Taiga who got lost. His eyes were full of wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Taiga must have thought what Hokuto meant behind his words. <em> Oh look how cute his face, those shiny eyes and long lashes, I want to… </em>— Okay, Hokuto needed to stop gazing at Taiga or his sanity would fly away again. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto averted his eyes off Taiga and met Kochi who smiled widely towards him, as if he could read his mind. </p><p> </p><p>“What?" Hokuto asked coldly. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing."</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“But seriously, don't make any sound. I don't want to hear anything tonight.” Kochi said as he walked away while waving at them, leaving them alone on the doorway. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga exchanged glances with Hokuto for a moment until he released a chuckle, followed by the younger while he blushed more than him.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you guys always like this?” Taiga asked with a smile on his lips. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto smiled sheepishly while scratching his neck, cheeks flushed in red after realizing that he was being silly in front of his lover.</p><p> </p><p>“He just likes teasing me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Like I do to you?" Taiga tilted his head and met Hokuto’s gaze, making his own heart burst. Hokuto landed his forehead against Taiga's as a smile etched on his lips, his hand still intertwined with Taiga's, meanwhile his other hand rested on the wooden door.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s warm breath tickled Taiga's nose. The soft smile on Hokuto’s lips had been replaced with a smirk before he spoke in a very low tone, "no, you're different.”</p><p> </p><p>A warm smile etched on Taiga's lips as Hokuto’s lips pressed his, smoothing their lips and sharing a very gentle kiss in a brief moment. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga released his lips as his lashes fluttered open and met Hokuto’s tender-eyed.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm sorry…” Hokuto said with eyes softened, “he's that kind of man but believe me, he's not a bad person."</p><p> </p><p>Taiga cupped Hokuto’s cheeks gently, gazing at him deeply with a radiant smile etched on his own lips, “it's okay, it's fun seeing you two." A short airy laugh—one of Hokuto’s favorite sounds in the world—escaped from Taiga's lips. His forehead leaned against Hokuto’s just for a few seconds. </p><p> </p><p>“You like it so much, don't you? Seeing me being teased like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do. I really like it." Taiga replied as he nuzzled Hokuto’s nose with his forefinger. </p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s heart thud as he looped Taiga in his arms, leaning his temple against Taiga's head. He knew Taiga was telling the truth. He knew Taiga would always be honest with his feelings and he really loved that side of him.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you realize that you smiled a lot today?” Hokuto asked while Taiga was playing with their interlocked fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Taiga bit his inner cheeks as he felt how hot his cheeks were. He lowered their hands and lifted his head to meet Hokuto’s gaze before he asked, "Do you like it?” </p><p> </p><p>"I love it.” Hokuto planted a soft kiss on Taiga's pinked cheeks, "I love it so much.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto’s soft kisses always caused warmth within Taiga's body. </p><p> </p><p>“Does it still hurt?" Hokuto looked at Taiga's feet, looking worried. </p><p> </p><p>“A bit… "</p><p> </p><p>“Let me treat your wound properly.”</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto then held Taiga's arm and walked out, bringing themselves to the living room. </p><p> </p><p>“I thought you wanted to do it in your room.” Taiga asked innocently, making Hokuto's ears flushed. </p><p> </p><p>“No, let's take a seat there." He replied as he pointed to the wide fluffy couch there.</p><p> </p><p>Kochi was right, if he kept Taiga in his room, he might only add more marks over Taiga's body. He couldn't lie that he really wanted to continue what they had done, but not now.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Maybe later. Sooner. Hopefully. </p>

<p>
<span>Taiga’s eyes wandered over the night sky, seeing how beautiful the stars scattered around it. The light sparkled across him, making his face glistened softly. A soft winter breeze blew against him, gently brushing his hair away from his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked even more beautiful than the moon above him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ticking sound of the clock behind him was being muted as he sensed a couple of warm arms looping around his waist gently. Taiga slightly turned his face and met Hokuto’s face on his shoulder. His eyes slightly widened as Hokuto pecked his cheek— Taiga sometimes still not used to Hokuto’s sudden kiss— and his cheeks bloomed in pink as Hokuto spoke close to his ear in a very gentle voice, “what are you doing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga placed his own arms over Hokuto’s, sharing warmth through their touched skin. He kept his eyes on the moon as he landed his temple against Hokuto’s head, letting the comfortable silence rise between them.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm enjoying the night view from here." Taiga replied calmly. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>"Do you like it?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A thin yet genuine smile formed on his lips, “I do. It looks different from what I'm used to seeing in the ocean. It feels more beautiful and warmer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga clearly knew the reason behind it was only because of Hokuto. He just felt a bit shy to admit it and he didn't know why.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it didn't matter, wasn't it? He could be here, standing with Hokuto. Staying warm in Hokuto’s embrace and feeling safe by listening to Hokuto’s heartbeat against his back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He could see the beauty of the moon and stars scattered above him. He could feel warmth even though the winter breeze rumbled at night. He could see how beautiful the gleam of lights on the street was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything seemed beautiful because he was with Hokuto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto, with a gentle smile etched on his lips and a pair of soulful eyes locked on his lover while leaning his chin onto his shoulder, softly throwing a question of how Taiga found him on the beach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga lowered his head as a soft smile bloomed on his face. He told him everything that happened that night. How he woke up on a winter night, how he walked alone on the sand, how he looked for him and saw a tent, and how he woke up for the second time in a stranger’s house. Taiga told Hokuto about everything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, she was the one who gave you those clothes?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga nodded slowly twice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn't she give you better clothes…” Hokuto mumbled to himself. It was sad seeing Taiga in a thin layer shirt and walking barefooted. He wished he came home later or stayed longer outside that night because he might have met Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Did you know her name? “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga shook his head, "no… She told me the story of it, but none of those I could remember after knowing that I was there for 3 days. I panicked and I just ran away. I didn't even say thanks to her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s thumb caressed Taiga's hand beneath him. He couldn't imagine how terrified Taiga was. Waking up in a world that he never had been for the first time, at midnight and all alone. Hokuto pressed his lips softly on Taiga's shoulder then he said, “I should've thanked her for saving your life… and not complaining about giving you short clothes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because now Hokuto realized that it was still so much better than letting Taiga walk alone or lay down over the cold sand on a winter night. If no one was there to help him, Taiga might freeze and Hokuto didn't even want to think about the worst thing that could happen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The winter wind blew past them and made Taiga's body shiver. He just felt how cold the night was even though Hokuto had given him warm clothes and long trousers. The lights across the street flashed for a moment as Hokuto's mind stuck on another thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“... Wait a minute…” Hokuto raised his head, brows furrowed as he stared at the plants under the wooden-window. “So, she helped to change your clothes? You were completely naked when you arrived, right?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Mhhm. I guess so. I didn't have any clothes but when I woke up, I wore that t-shirt.” Taiga replied as he looked at the bathroom, lifting his chin as if he was pointing at the clothes hanging behind the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ticking sound of the clock now reached Taiga's ears as silence began to envelop them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's soft breath seemed to blend in with the winter night. The light across the street flickered again when Taiga realized that Hokuto fell in silence behind him, creating another silence between them longer than before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga turned his chest facing his boyfriend as he took his own hand away from him and met Hokuto’s eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Taiga looked deeper, he found there was a little disappointment hidden behind them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga tilted his head cutely, cupping Hokuto’s cheeks gently before he asked in concern, “are you okay?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s eyes slightly dropped, his lips were hanging loosely as he lost on his own words. It took a few moments from him to spill his feelings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"She saw you naked… '' His voice was so weak that Taiga could barely hear it if he didn't stand closer to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s breath that touched his cheeks only started the heat within Hokuto. His mind whirled only on the image of Taiga’s naked body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then the fact that other people might have seen him especially when he was completely naked caused the blood to rush in his veins. Hokuto wasn't sure if it was jealousy or excitement, he couldn't tell yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well… yeah I guess so. She helped me so of course she saw me naked. Unless she closed her eyes. Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ah…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto looked nervous again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Hokuto look nervous? Taiga didn't say anything wrong and he didn't tease him at all. He found it odd how Hokuto turned red over and over in just a few hours. Taiga didn't understand why. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, he could understand if Hokuto was blushed whenever he touched or talked to him or even teased him. But he didn't understand the causes of Hokuto becoming red beside those reasons.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And it happened twice tonight, at the moments where Taiga couldn't get the reason why Hokuto became so red.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>…Wait, was it because… </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga lifted his brows as the corner of his lips curled before he asked, "Hokuto, are you… jealous?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sentence that was hanging in Hokuto’s tongue was finally released.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"She saw you naked… before me…Taiga " </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you've seen me half naked before, right? And she just helped me, Hokuto. That's all"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It wasn't what I meant… '' Hokuto said half whispered while lowering his head, hiding his embarrassment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course she wouldn't do that to Taiga. Hokuto believed it. But that person had seen him naked, not half-naked like usual, but  completely naked, before him…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto let out a long sigh before his lips formed a thin line.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't understand. Hokuto knew Taiga didn't understand what he meant unless he explained his feelings towards him. But telling him how he wanted to see him </span>
<em>
<span>like </span>
</em>
<span>that… would be… a bit wild, wouldn't it? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't think he could tell him. He couldn't bear the embarrassment that started growing within him. Even just by thinking about it, his heart already skipped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He knew Taiga was his boyfriend, he could just tell him. But no, Hokuto couldn't. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How could he tell him that it wasn't the same thing? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How could he tell him that seeing Taiga, his boyfriend, half naked when he was a siren, was a different thing when he saw him half naked as a human.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course it wasn't the same thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though Hokuto had known the taste of Taiga's skin when he was a siren, the image he had in his mind of Taiga as a human and completely naked, for some reason had turned Hokuto on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Taiga's innocent face, which still didn't understand what Hokuto meant, actually just caused the increase of his heartbeat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So you mean, you want to see me naked too?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto really thought his heart had stopped beating. It might have exploded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I don't mind showing myself to you. I'm yours and you can see anything of me if you want. Do you want it?” Taiga asked innocently with head tilted slightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto almost lost his mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was smart, he was brilliant. But he could be so innocent like this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the innocence of Taiga only made Hokuto harder. There was no way he could hold himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He would just do it. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no idea what you've said, Taiga." </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s brain was still in a fog but there was no time to ask about anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Hokuto had sealed his lips tightly, smooching him fiercely as he pulled him on his waist, closing the distance between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s hand stroked Taiga's back gently, sending shivers down his spine and made Taiga let out a soft moan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The skilled hand of Hokuto now moved to grab Taiga's hair, changing the angle of their kisses so he could taste Taiga's lips better. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sound of their smacking lips against each other and their clashing teeth filled the room. The wind rushed outside became unheard and the ticking clock hanging behind him was completely muted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto's skilled hands now moved over Taiga’s body, stroking him gently and making him gasp over and over between their searing kisses. Hokuto couldn't hold himself as his lips cupped Taiga's lower lips and pushed his own tongue inside him. Hokuto guided him and linked their tongues beautifully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga let out a soft moan from his throat before he got drunk because of Hokuto's kiss. His left fingers tugged on Hokuto’s head, meanwhile his right hand tightly looped around Hokuto’s neck. As if he was looking for something to be held before he fell any deeper into the pleasure of Hokuto’s soul kisses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A pair of legs that he just got a few days ago seemed to be able to move on their own way by wrapping around Hokuto’s waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without any hesitation, Hokuto caught its signal as a hint. He took Taiga's other leg and curled it around his waist as his hands were busy holding Taiga's thighs tightly, carrying him to the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto landed his own ass on the bed, letting Taiga sit on him and showered him more kisses, wanting Taiga to enjoy the kisses any longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They had kissed a hundred times, tasting each other's lips and skin for many times, feeding their soul with each other's taste, but Taiga could make sure that he never felt like this before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He never felt this kind of heat that rushed in his blood as much as this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto was good at making his heart skip in various ways. But this time, it felt different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto had never made his heart beat </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> fast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How could it be?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How could this happen?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No matter how many times they kissed, Taiga found the heat that now boiled in his blood was different. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He never felt like this before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s kisses had never felt </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> hot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His body was on fire. His blood raced in his veins up to his head. Something that he knew as adrenaline seemed to be racing in his blood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lost in Hokuto's kiss and touch, Taiga let out soft moans when Hokuto trailed his tongue over his neck. And his moans became louder as Hokuto bit his glowing skin and left a new color on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not just once, but Hokuto already bruised Taiga's neck and gave the same color all over it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanting to feed himself more, Hokuto moved to eat Taiga's swollen lips, biting Taiga's lower lip a bit harder as if he was still starving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was easy for Hokuto to ignore how hard they pant and how painful himself as Taiga grinded over him — unintentionally of course — pushing his own shaft against Hokuto’s and making the younger had to swallow his groan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto could feel how sticky he was already behind his tight pants as he pulled up Taiga's white sweater, undressing him fastly but still carefully — as he didn't want to cause any scratch on Taiga's skin — before he switched their position, laying Taiga's back on top of a crumpled navy colored sheet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's black hair flowed beautifully with fine beads of sweat adorned his forehead. The dim light from Hokuto’s room only made Taiga’s skin look glistened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A pair of Taiga's dreamy eyes gazed deeply at Hokuto, making the younger get lost again into those dazzling eyes. Taiga's reddened and swollen lips slightly opened, as if inviting Hokuto to suck it again and again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Hokuto still got lost in Taiga's beauty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga exuded a beauty that Hokuto had never seen from anyone or anywhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His beauty was already dazzling when he was a siren. But Taiga as a human looked different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga looked alluring.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even in a state like this, lying beautifully under him, waiting for Hokuto to do anything to him and making him look even more beautiful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's beauty was overwhelming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His ethereal beauty completely tantalized Hokuto and enveloped him in his charm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The look in Taiga's dreamy eyes, the swollen and reddened of Taiga's moist lips, the soft moans that escaped from his lips every time Hokuto touched him, and the melodious breath that Taiga let out of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything had inebriated Hokuto more than anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga indeed was a siren but without him singing his song, Hokuto had drunk over him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without Taiga asking, Hokuto would do anything for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was like a king and Hokuto was like his servant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But in fact, they weren't a king and his servant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was just Taiga and Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two people that were completely and deeply in love with each other, wanting to explore more things between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And everything Hokuto wanted to do for now was to please him, to exhilarate him, to satisfy him in a feeling that Taiga had probably never felt before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Hokuto pulled up his own shirt before he laid down and trailed his tongue over Taiga's skin. Wetting him and marking him with his own tongue, reaching every place on Taiga's skin he could reach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hundreds of sighs seemed to never stop escaping from Taiga's lips and without him realizing it, his hands grabbed Hokuto's hair and gripped him tightly. His back arching as Hokuto reached his nipple, nibbling it with his little fangs. Meanwhile, Hokuto's other hands were busy playing with the other side of Taiga's buds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pink buds finally hardened, wet and now became red. Showing him how skilled Hokuto was at playing with his tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again and again, those hundred moans of pleasure kept escaping from Taiga's lips. His blood that rushed in his veins now reached his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga gasped loudly as Hokuto bit his hardened pink bud, sucking it for a bit more before he moved his tongue on Taiga's belly, slowly down to touch his crotch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto looked up and found how Taiga's eyes darkened, full of lust and desire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's dark green eyes said everything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't need to hear any words of what Taiga wanted, just by looking into those tantalizing eyes, Hokuto already knew it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The corner of Hokuto’s lips curled as he looked deeply into Taiga's eyes, locking his eyes into his as he lowered his own head to reach Taiga's shaft.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His lips started kissing Taiga's shaft behind its clothes, slowly and slowly, before he started to let out his tongue to wet its clothes. Hokuto could see how those dazzling eyes widened, his lips also slightly opened and the fingers that tugged Hokuto’s hair also became tighter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's moans became louder and louder as Hokuto squeezed him, moving him slowly up and down, and sending shivers down Taiga's spine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He never felt this before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga never experienced this before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was supposed to be afraid but why did he just feel his blood burnt and excitement rushed in his veins? What kind of pleasure started flowing over his body? Taiga didn't know about this. He never felt like this before, but he wanted to know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted Hokuto to do it over and over. He wanted Hokuto to suck him more. He wanted to feel more of the pleasure that Hokuto offered to him. He wanted to feel more and more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to know more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Anything!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to feel anything that Hokuto could give to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to know anything that Hokuto could tell him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It felt amazing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s tongue felt so warm, wet, and amazing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah… Hokku…—ahhhh!!!!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto pulled down Taiga's trousers, releasing his hardened cock from its cage. The cold that momentarily touched his shaft was immediately replaced by Hokuto's warm breath blowing onto his cock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto's charming tongue now moved to Taiga’s cock. Wetting the pink and hardened pecker with his tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh Taiga…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kyomoto Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto was amazed by Taiga's beauty anew. Even his crotch was beautiful, Hokuto’s thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto clearly knew how beautiful Taiga was. He knew how he got intoxicated by Taiga. Even without sex, Hokuto’s body and soul are already filled with Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the moment to taste Taiga to this extent was something he had never imagined.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But he never did this before, at least with a man. Hokuto had learned about this but he never did it before. He was afraid that any wrong step would hurt Taiga. He wanted to make his boyfriend good, he wanted to please him. He wanted to make </span>
<em>
<span>them </span>
</em>
<span>good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto buried Taiga's crotch within his mouth, swallowing it fully until it throbbed and reached his own throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After letting out one and two coughs for being choked by Taiga's crotch, Hokuto started moving his head slowly, producing a rhythm with Taiga's loud moans.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's fingers turned white as he dug the crumpled sheet with his own nails. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His mind got drunk because of Hokuto's play. Several ineffable feelings flooded within him. His body heated up, his breath became shorter and sweat fell down his forehead to his temple. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn't know about this thing but he could feel his body was seeking for something. He could feel his body shiver by Hokuto’s touch. And just by a bit of his touch, Taiga spilled the liquid inside Hokuto's mouth. His body felt weak but the indescribable pleasure was still there. His eyes, which had been closed, now opened slowly and met Hokuto who was crawling to reach his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto wiped his lips with the back of his hand and swallowed Taiga's milk as much as he could before he shared another kiss with him. Even Taiga didn't get any moment to ask as Hokuto pressed his lips against his, smacking him with another searing kiss as if they didn't do it earlier.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto then broke their kiss for a moment. His eyes wanted to be spoiled by the beauty of Taiga who laid submissively beneath him. Hokuto couldn't hide his thudding heart when he realized that he was the one who caused the sparkles on Taiga's face. His thumb reached Taiga's face gently, caressing his boyfriend while his eyes wandered to admire his figure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's beauty is always breathtaking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto could spend his entire life just admiring him, feeding his soul, satisfying his eyes till his heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the caressing touch of Hokuto’s thumb over his cheeks and a pair of his soulful eyes that locked with him only made Taiga's heart throbbed even more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But there were some things that Taiga wanted to ask about after what Hokuto did to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He wanted to know about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But his body didn't let him as it took over himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His arms moved by themselves and circled around Hokuto’s neck before he led him down to kiss him anew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s lips felt different. It felt wetter and sweeter and for some reason Taiga hadn't figured it out yet, he loved it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He loved it more and more. And he wanted to feel good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Taiga was sure, only Hokuto could give him those feelings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto… “ Taiga called softly as Hokuto planted soft kisses over his reddened and glistened face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, love?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Are you uncomfortable?" Hokuto asked again, starting to worry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto brushed away Taiga's strained hair and tucked it behind his ear as Taiga shook his head slowly and said, “show me more, Hokuto."</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Teach me more."</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to know more."</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to feel more…"</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That's it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's begs had become Hokuto's weakness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He couldn't stand it if Taiga begged about anything and this time, Taiga's eyes had spoken to him deeper than his words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His eyes had spoken in words that were more captivating than his siren song.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga was indeed capable of paralyzing someone with his singing, but Hokuto didn't need Taiga's singing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't need to sing to make Hokuto do what he wanted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Taiga wanted to ask, Hokuto would be happy to answer. If Taiga wanted to learn, Hokuto would be happy to teach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Taiga wanted to be pleased, Hokuto would love to please him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto would do anything if it made Taiga happy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto would do anything if it made Taiga feel safe and comfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He would </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even if he had to give his soul to save Taiga, he would do it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because he belongs to Taiga and Taiga belongs to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s whole heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's whole body.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's soft whispers at night or in the morning to wake him up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's small attention that he gave to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's thin yet alluring smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything belonged to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Hokuto would do anything for him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Call him a dumb or crazy love, Hokuto didn't mind it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He only knew that he loved him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto loved Taiga with all of his heart and his soul. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Neither I nor you ever did this, Taiga. And it might be so painful for you to take it.” Hokuto spoke gently as he caressed Taiga's cheeks with his thumb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But do you know what to do?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto landed a soft kiss onto Taiga's eyes before he spoke, “I do… theoretically.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The way Hokuto said it shyly made Taiga chuckle. He cupped Hokuto’s cheeks and locked his gaze into him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you expect us to do this in the future, Hokuto? That's why you learned about it." Taiga asked as he recalled the memory when Hokuto told him that he was never into a man before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Only theoretically…” Hokuto spoke as he threw another shy smile at him and Taiga could see how red Hokuto's face became afterwards. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Then let's learn it practically."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damn, Taiga.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't know how many times his heart had bursted whenever Taiga spoke gently and looked at him with those dazzling eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I promise I will be gentle to you. Let me know if you can't bear the pain, okay?” said Hokuto as he pecked Taiga's eyes gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A single nod from Taiga was enough for Hokuto to crash his lips against his as he stroked Taiga's damp hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The kisses were slow and gentle for a few seconds before Hokuto lost his control and took Taiga's lips any deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga gasped when Hokuto broke their fierce kisses and pulled up his body to take off his clothes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As he finished undressing Taiga, he started undressing himself hurriedly, loosening the belt around his waist and pulling down the trousers followed by its boxer, not wanting to make his lover wait any longer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or maybe it was Hokuto himself who couldn't wait, he wasn't sure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto bent down to reach Taiga's swollen lips and kissed him fervently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s breath hitched when Hokuto broke the kiss and moved his lips to his hand, smooching his palm and trailing his tongue up to his arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga took a deep breath before Hokuto shut his moans by catching his lower lip and biting it carefully — Hokuto was aware that he didn't want to make his lover bleed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga let a gasp escape from his lips as Hokuto broke his kisses and moved his tongue to trail over Taiga's belly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A hundred moans and hitched breaths filled the room as Hokuto trailed his tongue over Taiga's body. Licking Taiga's white liquid which turned out to be around his stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seems like I spilled a bit of it from my mouth,” Hokuto spoke in a very deep tone with a little smirk etched on his lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He kept his rhythm and played his tongue so well that Taiga didn't even realize that Hokuto started moving his tongue to lick Taiga's entrance, gently wetting the wall Taiga’s tight muscle before Hokuto started another practical lesson. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ahhhhhhhh, Hokuto!!! Ahhhhhh—....!!!!!!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's back curve beautifully as Hokuto poked his entrance and licked it afresh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damn!!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto really knew how to use his tongue. Taiga felt like he wanted it to be inside him any longer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga thought this was the best pleasure that he ever felt, but then Hokuto surprised him with another lesson. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His eyes widened in pleasure as Hokuto pushed his own forefinger into the same hole where his tongue was. Taiga really wanted to scream and let out his groans but Hokuto locked them in his lips, not wanting anyone to hear it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Taiga broke their kisses because he ran out of breath and his head felt spinning, Hokuto moved his lips to plant soft kisses over Taiga's glowing face. He gently kissed him as he pushed another finger within him. Hokuto kept pushing his two fingers slowly and steadily before he added another finger and spread him wide, making another load moan escape from Taiga's lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hok— ahhh… Hokuto ahhhh!!!!!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The electricity sent down to his spine as he felt something within him being touched by Hokuto’s finger. His eyes shut tightly and his mouth hung loosely. Taiga tugged his fingers deeply over the bedsheets as if his life depended on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You like it, love?" Hokuto asked half whispered as he kissed Taiga's temple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did you touch?" Taiga asked back, panting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I hit your spot."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh, damn. That was so good. That was so <em>fucking</em> good that Taiga wanted more. He wanted to feel more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"More, Hokuto. More!! I want—ahhhh… I want more!! Please Hokuto, ple—ahhhh…!!!!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga’s begs were Hokuto’s weakness, indeed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this time, Hokuto wanted to learn more practically with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So he pulled out his fingers slowly as he locked his eyes on Taiga. Taiga’s brows furrowed as he felt empty. He was going to whine again but Hokuto shut his mouth by sucking his lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn't know how swollen and red their lips were as they kept sucking each other's lips without caring about the other things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To tell the truth Hokuto wanted to play more with Taiga, but his body sought for its release. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto then opened the drawer on his bedside table to get a bottle of lube and poured it onto his hardened cock. The hot and lick liquid spread over him, making him shiver.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Hokuto, without waiting any longer, positioned himself in front of Taiga's entrance and lifted Taiga's knees to let them hang on his shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga swallowed hard as he locked his eyes on Hokuto’s above him. Hokuto’s cock was huge, hardened, and there was a white liquid on the top of it. Taiga wanted to ask but he could keep his questions for later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He took a gulp, feeling his blood raced in his veins and his ears could hear how loud his heartbeat was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga felt like his heart was going to burst.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His fingers were busy tugging on the bedsheet as Hokuto started to put his cock inside him slowly. His eyes and lips widened in excitement as Hokuto pushed himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s movements were slow, very gentle, and careful as he didn't want to hurt Taiga by the pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But the shock and the pain started spreading over his body. Taiga’s fingers tugged the bedsheets any deeper and his eyes were now shut tightly as he gritted his teeth, trying to reduce its pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Taiga, do you want me to stop?" Hokuto asked in worry, cupping Taiga's cheeks as he looked at him in concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It took a few moments for Taiga to shake his head after he managed to deal with the pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No…” Taiga let out a breath, "It's okay, Hokuto. Keep going. I think I can deal with it more.” Taiga replied as he tried to steady his breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A soft smile etched on his lips as Hokuto kissed him gently, a kiss that assured Taiga that he would keep his promise to be gentle to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure, we can stop if you can't—"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!" Taiga cut Hokuto’s words while cupping his cheeks in his own palm, “please keep going, Hokuto." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto tried to adjust himself within Taiga as he pushed himself again slowly. His hand reached Taiga's and held him tight, meanwhile his other hand was busy resting beside Taiga as a support for his own weight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto landed soft kisses onto Taiga's face as he started to find his rhythm. The same rhythm as their mingled breath and their loud heartbeat against each other’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto moved himself a bit faster while watching Taiga's face, worrying that he would miss any discomfort on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't know.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn't understand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was it how the human body works? Was it how humans have sex? Did it always feel like this? Did it always feel this good?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The hot, the short breath, the moans that he let out without him realizing already filled the room. Their hot breath spread over the room and enveloped them and caused warmth over their bodies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The groan that Hokuto let to escape from his lips and the gentleness that Hokuto gave to him, everything made him good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga could feel how rushed his blood was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga could hear his own heartbeat against Hokuto’s chest and there was no doubt that he could hear Hokuto’s heartbeat too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto had taught him this much </span>
<em>
<span>practically </span>
</em>
<span>but Taiga still didn't understand. Was it how his body as a human works by its touch? Was it how humans have sex? This was they felt? Taiga didn't know, he still didn't understand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But he only knew that it felt good. It felt so </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> good like he didn't want to stop. He felt like he was over the moon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or maybe because it was Hokuto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because only Hokuto could make Taiga feel </span>
<em>
<span>this </span>
</em>
<span>good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The electricity rushed down his spine as Hokuto hit his spot. Taiga couldn't stop his moans and so did Hokuto. Hokuto pushed himself again, going any deeper until he was completely bottomed out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's eyes widened and he felt like he saw stars, the brightest stars as Hokuto’s cock hit him and throbbed within him, causing him to let out the same liquid that he had spurted out earlier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto opened his eyes and saw how Taiga's eyes darkened beneath him, full of lust and desire, as if he was seeing his own reflection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pain hit Taiga hard but something good followed afterwards. And the next thing he knew, some white liquids spurted out again and spread over his own chest. Taiga's body was shivering but he felt good. He felt so </span>
<em>
<span>damn </span>
</em>
<span>good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And he felt warm liquid spread inside him as he felt Hokuto's cock throbbed inside him. Their breath unsteady, their skin sticky by sweat and face already reddened. Brushes over his own neck and his hardened nipple felt very sensitive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga grabbed Hokuto's neck and guided him to kiss him again slowly, softly, letting tenderness wrapped them tight. He breathed softly in front of Hokuto’s lips as he cupped his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto who just reached his climax, leaning his forehead against Taiga's and giving him a gentle smile. A chuckle escaped from their lips and their cheeks bloomed in red.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The wind rageous outside and the snow was falling anew. It was such a cold winter night but what they could feel was just warmth that spread from their bodies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga then closed his eyes as Hokuto brushed his nose over his cheeks and showered him with butterfly kisses. Telling him how much he loved him and how happy he was to have him beside him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Taiga replied with the same actions by kissing Hokuto’s face gently. Whispering how much he loved him and how grateful he was to have him beside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Never once he thought that he would experience the best night ever with his lover.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto leaned his chest completely against Taiga’s as his arms looped Taiga's neck and closed the distance between them. Their breath had become steady and the sleepiness started gnawing into them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto closed his eyes for a moment, wanting to sleep and forgetting that he was still inside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then realization hit him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What's that, Hokuto?" Taiga asked in panic as he saw Hokuto’s face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I forgot the condom… " </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga's brows slightly furrowed, “condom?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was supposed to wrap this with it so I wouldn't cum inside… you…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga didn't understand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"So, you mean, if you use this condom you wouldn't spill your liquid inside me and I wouldn't feel it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto nodded as he tried to hide his blush. Sometimes Taiga's innocence could really make him blush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I love it, Hokuto…” Taiga spoke in a spoiled tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I love to feel you inside me. You're so warm, I love it." Taiga said while pouting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can we do it again, Hokuto?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A soft laugh escaped from Hokuto’s lips as he buried his face on Taiga's collar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure!” Hokuto raised his head and locked his gaze in Taiga's, "let's do it again."</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>▪️▪️</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The pinged sound of his phone woke Hokuto up from his deep sleep. Winter sun rays peeked through the curtains of the window. The soft symphony created by Taiga's soft breathing that sounded in his ears made Hokuto's heart beat faster. Hokuto then realized how stiff his hand was as Taiga used it as his pillow. He adjusted his chest to face Taiga and gazed at him deeply with eyes full of tenderness and a warm smile formed on his own lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The same moment that he saw in his dreams every night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The same moment that he had been yearning for every night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Woke up with Taiga sleeping soundly in his arms; Hokuto had been dreaming about it every night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And today, this morning, he realized that it wasn't a dream. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He had Taiga in his arms, sleeping peacefully and beautifully, breathing softly on his chest. The overflowing happiness within him made his heart want to explode.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto caressed Taiga's cheek gently with his knuckles, his touches were very gentle, worrying that he might wake his boyfriend up. Taiga's plumed lips slightly opened, as if inviting Hokuto to lean his own lips onto it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto then leaned slowly without making any slight movement even on his own arms, and then planted a very gentle kiss on Taiga's lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s kiss was very gentle, but no matter how gentle it was, Hokuto's warm touch would always be felt on Taiga's body. His long lashes fluttered open as Hokuto placed his lips over him before he pulled back and met Taiga’s sleepy eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, love.” Hokuto whispered in front of Taiga's lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before answering, Taiga moved closer to bury his face on Hokuto’s collar and breathed softly as Hokuto looped his arms around Taiga’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morning… I'm sleepy… ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto hooked Taiga's body, pulling him closer and planted a soft kiss on Taiga’s ethereal skin before he leaned his own cheeks against Taiga's head. His thumb brushed Taiga's shoulder gently, wanting to make his boyfriend sleep anew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The chirping sound of birds above the tree outside the window filled the room. The ticking sound of a clock hanging on the wall filled his ears. And the soft harmony from Taiga's breath filled Hokuto’s heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Hokuto closed his eyes, almost fell asleep, Taiga raised his head and planted a kiss on his chin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto smiled softly but without opening his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga wanted to spoil his boyfriend in the early morning, so he adjusted his body and kissed Hokuto’s lips softly. He licked his own lips to moist it before he moved them to kiss Hokuto’s cheekbones, moving to the beautiful bridge of Hokuto’s sharp nose, and then planted some soft kisses on Hokuto’s eyes, showering him with so many kisses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto couldn't hold the tickle feelings that started spreading in his body. His eyes opened and a radiant smile etched on his lips before he called his lover's name softly, “Taiga… ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yea..." Taiga replied as he pecked Hokuto’s chin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A soft chuckle escaped from Hokuto’s lips as Taiga started showering him some rapid kisses on his chin over and over and before Taiga could do more, Hokuto took Taiga's pulmed lips and sealed it in his.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The genuine smile formed on each other's lips as Hokuto broke their kiss and both of them then locked their eyes into each other's gaze.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto?" Taiga called softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto let his eyes wander over Taiga's ethereal beauty before he answered, “yes, love?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you like me as a human?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question blurted out from Taiga's mouth as it was. It didn't mean that he lacked confidence in himself as a human, but it was just purely because of his curiosity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It took a few moments for Taiga to get Hokuto’s answer, but the sentence that escaped from Hokuto’s lips was something he didn't expect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're so beautiful."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga had received the same compliment from others for years but he didn't care about any of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But if it was from Hokuto, Taiga could never hide his blushed cheeks. Taiga didn't even know exactly how many times Hokuto had been telling him the same thing over and over since they met. But he knew there wasn't a single moment when he didn't blush because of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hokuto you don't answer my—..."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I always love you."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga really thought his heart had exploded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I always love you. You as a siren or a human, it doesn't matter for me because I… love you. I love you because it is you, Taiga. And I'll always love you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga bit his lower lip as if he could hide his grin, averting his eyes from Hokuto’s as he felt the butterfly within his stomach. Taiga moved closer to Hokuto, buried himself on his collar again as Hokuto looped his arms around him, breathing softly against each other's skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto spoke again in a very deep tone and Taiga could feel it vibrate on his chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just want to be with you, Taiga. Wherever we are and whenever it is. I need you and I just want to be with you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memory of their hard time until they finally arrived at this moment came in a flash in Taiga's mind. His vision blurred and Taiga quickly clenched his hand between their chests, holding back his tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I can't deny that I really love our moments when we sleep and wake up together on a bed like this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga planted a warm kiss onto Hokuto’s skin, holding back his tears before he spoke in a very soft voice, "I want to be with you too, Hokuto."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I need you and I want to be with you too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just wanted to be with Hokuto. Nothing more, just to be with him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So did Hokuto. He loved to have some moments with Taiga as a human, in their own world and sharing warmth under the same sheets.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Taiga just wanted to be with Hokuto and knowing how happy Hokuto was when they could be together like this was enough for Taiga to decide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He decided that he would do anything to be with him. He would do anything so he could be with Hokuto. To spend his time with Hokuto. In the human world, as a human, a proper human.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even if Taiga had to kill again, or wipe out his entire fellows, he would do it. There was no longer any hesitation in him to kill his fellow sirens. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To spend his time with Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To live with Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To stay beside Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He would do it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He would do it over and over again, until none of them existed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For Hokuto.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Only for Hokuto.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto pulled Taiga closer as if there was still a distance between them, ignoring how warm and sticky their bodies were due to what they did last night. Hokuto planted some kisses onto Taiga's milky skin, before he moved his lips to reach his neck, his blushed cheeks, the pretty bridge of his nose, and finished it by smooching his lips, sharing a gentle yet fierce kiss in the winter morning.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“My Taiga… ” Hokuto whispered between their kisses, “I love you…” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Taiga’s cheeks bloomed in pink as he smiled and said, “I love you too, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<span>▪️▪️</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Like a newly-wed couple who enjoyed the honeymoon phase, Taiga and Hokuto spend their time happily together everyday. It didn't mean that they always had sex at any time or were romantic by cuddling with each other. They didn't need to be like that to be called a honeymoon couple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were just there, being next to each other, laughing freely and smiling brightly. Technically just their usual days that they used to spend on the beach back then, but now they could do it at home. A proper place where nothing could separate them except work. They were so deeply in love with each other that Kochi even questioned himself why he had to be there, watching them while he was just all alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So Kochi moved out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm going to move tomorrow."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto stopped chewing his lunch for a moment and raised his head, facing Kochi who sat in front of his desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You really want to move?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're the one who asked me, bro. Besides, I don't want to be there, watching you two being so lovey-dovey.” Kochi shook his head as he took a sip of his cup of ramen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto let out a sigh through his nose before he spoke, “I was just kidding. You can still stay in that house if you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kochi squinted his eyes as he looked at Hokuto, “you're going to miss me, huh?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both laughed for a few moments.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto indeed asked Kochi to move but it was a joke. He didn't mean to be rude for kicking his best friend away because his boyfriend lived with him. Both of them were important to him, and Hokuto wanted them to stay close with him. Also it was fun to see Taiga had another friend even though it was only Kochi.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I need to move. Your current house was too small for us. I've been bothering you enough for these months. Also, maybe I'd meet someone in my life so I could live with them. Seeing how happy you're now with Taiga really makes me happy and I realized that I want that kind of life too.” Kochi said with a genuine smile on his lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A thin yet warm smile formed on Hokuto’s lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Kochi was right.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything had changed since he met Taiga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto could tell his life was brighter after he met him. He was grateful for having Kochi beside him for years, but he couldn't deny that he was such a burden for him too. And knowing that Kochi wanted to try a new life made him happy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anyway, I’m so curious about it. Do you know how Taiga turned into a human?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The smile on Hokuto’s face faded slowly. He kept eating his bento as Kochi stared at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don't know.” He replied without looking at Kochi. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why? He didn't tell you?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He told me that he woke up at midnight on the beach, then someone helped him and then we met."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't want to see how Kochi looked at him and he didn't know why Kochi’s curiosity perturbed him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wonder how he turned into a human. Did someone help him? You know, like a witch or something like that."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto took another bite of his bento as he let Kochi mumble more and more of his thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He was not really listening to it because he didn't want to be disquieted by thoughts that he shouldn't have. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don't you want to know?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What for?" Hokuto asked, starting to feel irritated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well… If I were you, I'd like to know about it. How could my boyfriend turn into a human? Did he make a deal with a witch? Or did he take some potion or—....”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You're reading fairy tales too much.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You forgot that even our life could be like a fairytale.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damnit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Kochi start being annoying at the wrong time?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't know about how Taiga turned into a human. He didn't ask and it didn't matter. He had Taiga beside him and everything they had was something they had been dreaming. They just wanted to be together, spending their time in the same world, living happily and freely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did Hokuto have to know about the other thing? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto had lost his appetite as Kochi threw another sentence that incensed him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're not avoiding something, aren't you?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?" Hokuto asked, brows frowning and feeling insulted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You'd act like this when you're avoiding something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm not.” Hokuto replied firmly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Then why didn't you ask him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto couldn't hold his words anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Why do you really want to know? He's not your business! You just met him for a month. Why do you sound like you have known him for years?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto just realized that he had raised his voice. He found Kochi staring at him in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was just asking."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto looked away as he leaned back to his seat. A long and sharp breath escaped through his nose as he crossed his arms. The guilt started to creep in. He didn't know why the topic of how Taiga turned into a human completely irritated him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to speak like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"I'm just afraid that I might lose him if he felt uncomfortable with me.” Hokuto spoke with honesty within it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because it was true. Everything he told Kochi was true. He was just afraid that he might lose Taiga. He loved every moment he had with him and he didn't want to ruin anything. Taiga didn't bring up the topic of it and Hokuto didn't want to ask about it either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hokuto felt like he was already in the station of </span>
<em>
<span>he just wanted to cherish every moment he had with Taiga</span>
</em>
<span>. He didn't want to ask any unimportant thing towards him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After everything he and Taiga had been through, he didn't want to ruin it, especially if it was just a simple question of how Taiga turned into a human.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He didn't need to know. He didn't need to ask about it. He had Taiga beside him and Taiga didn't have to bother to explain anything to him. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto didn't need to know about it either, right? </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, he didn't need to know it.  </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He believed if Taiga wanted to tell him something, he would. He believed Taiga wouldn't hide anything from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Taiga would always be honest to him no matter what. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Or maybe that was only his own thoughts. He didn't know. He wasn't sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For now, Hokuto didn't want to talk or hear about this.</span>
