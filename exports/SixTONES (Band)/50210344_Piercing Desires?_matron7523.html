<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Juri pierces Shintaro's ears once again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>As soon as I learned that Shintaro's ear piercings were done by Juri during high school, I couldn't resist turning this scenario into a fic. But I didn't want to write about high schoolers, so I opted for a present-day setting with Shintaro wanting more ear piercings lol. I hope this short ficlet meets the expectations of my two readers!❤️</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Okay, but when I pull out the needle, you've got to be as still as a statue," Juri commands. In that very moment, Shintaro feels like they've been whisked a whole decade back in time, back to the days when they were carefree high school students.</p><p>The most noticeable change, of course, is their height; they've both shot up nearly ten centimeters since those days. Shintaro's also got a bit more bulk now, while Juri's not that much. Mentally, well, let's just say they wouldn't derive the same thrill from skipping classes or sneaking off to family restaurants or rooftops to evade the watchful eyes of their teachers. Back then, they might have had more freedom than most kids their age, but whether you were an idol trainee or not, adults were still a buzzkill. Dealing with them was, quite frankly, dull and boring in their teenage minds. So, they made it their mission to avoid or minimize adult interactions whenever possible.</p><p>Shintaro fondly recalls Juri during their high school days. How he used to be the mastermind behind all sorts of innovative plots back at Horikoshi High School. By now, Shintaro has heard those legendary stories at least a thousand times - like the one where Juri convinced teachers that Kyomoto Taiga was bedridden in the infirmary when, in reality, Taiga just wanted to skip the PE classes he hated. And as a token of gratitude, Taiga would occasionally let Juri copy his homework. Classic high school-style bribery.</p><div class="group w-full text-token-text-primary border-b bg-gray-50">

<p>When Shintaro entered Horikoshi as a first-grader, he was already aware of Juri's reputation there – how the guy had a talent for involving their younger peers in all kinds of daring activities, some of which skirted the edge of trouble. This was especially true when he wasn't engrossed in his phone, a device that appeared permanently glued to his hand, even during class, where he staked out the last row as his secret haven.</p>
<p>Some kids found Juri a bit scary, but he also had many admirers among their schoolmates. Especially among girls on Valentine's Day, when he received the most chocolates and was the Chocolate King of the whole school. Interestingly, Juri never paid much attention to the gifts, leaving his poor mother responsible for ensuring he gave something back to all the girls on White Day.</p>
<p>And then there was Shintaro himself. Back then, he had an unusual status in the twisted world of entertainment. Despite being two grades below, he held a senior position to Juri and many other older students when it came to work. This weird dynamic led to the two of them spending a lot of time together. The usual senpai-kohai relations were somewhat blurred, and most notably, a kind of weird yet unique mutual admiration blossomed between them all the time.</p>
<p>Both Shintaro and Juri were driven by an urge to outshine each other, resulting in a continuous cycle of attempting to impress the other in various ways. Their mutual fascination was unmistakable to anyone who observed them, and it appeared to be a loop that persisted, even to this day.</p>
<p>Then, one sun-soaked Wednesday afternoon in October, they got a wonderful idea: what if Juri pierced Shintaro's ears? Naturally, Shintaro couldn't resist such a daring proposal. After all, who in their right mind would decline the offer of having their ears pierced by Tanaka Juri? With all the grace of a couple of amateurs, they gathered their supplies: complimentary ice cubes from Taco Bell, needles from Don Quijote that cost a mere 300 yen, and the school restroom as their temporary makeshift piercing parlor.</p>
<p>Everything miraculously went off without a hitch. Shintaro's ears remained unscathed, avoiding any threat of blood poisoning, and to their surprise, Juri did a fairly decent job. Well, as decent as an 18-year-old could be at making holes in someone's ears. To add to their delight, neither their parents nor teachers seemed to pay much attention to the new shiny accessories adorning Shintaro's ears. Furthermore, their classmates and colleagues were in awe of their bold stunt for years, regarding it as the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>"I've been toying with the idea of getting second piercings in my ears," Shintaro mentioned one sunny Thursday afternoon, a full ten years later.</p>

<p>He didn't anticipate the reaction he received. Juri's eyes immediately lit up as if he'd stumbled upon the best news ever. After a brief discussion and some unexpectedly persuasive arguments from Juri, the decision was made: Shintaro would indeed get the new piercings, and Juri enthusiastically embraced the role of a piercing artist once more. However, this time around, they mutually agreed that it was time to take their piercing game to the next level and upgrade it to a more mature style.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Juri got some disinfected disposable needles from a professional piercing studio and invited Shintaro over to his place, putting an end to any plans of using a public restroom again. And, of course, true to his adult character, Shintaro insisted on hailing a taxi, strictly opposing the idea of a 10-minute walk to the nearest station. They decided to skip the ice cubes, too. "Ice is mainly for numbing the ear, just in case it hurts. But it only hurts if you do it wrong," Juri assured him, and Shintaro believed him without question.</p>

<p>Sitting on the floor in front of Juri's couch, his back leaning against it, Shintaro can't shake the peculiar voice reminding him that they are no longer the teenagers they once were and that this whole situation might not rank among their most brilliant ideas.</p>
<p>He glances up at Juri, who's sitting on the couch right beside him. "Hey, you okay there? Do you need any help? Should I do something?"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Nah, it's all good. I'm just getting the needle out of its package soon," Juri responds, calm and focused. Shintaro notices Juri's steady hands from the corner of his eyes as Juri takes the package and sifts through it carefully.</p>
<p>"Do you have the earrings ready?" Juri then asks, and Shintaro gestures towards the coffee table where the new silver rings neatly lay on a napkin.</p>
<p>In his preparations, Juri suddenly pauses, his brows furrowing in thought. "You know, we should probably mark the spots before piercing them," he mutters aloud.</p>
<p>Shintaro chuckles at the suggestion. "Yeah, that's something we never really even thought about ten years ago! We just went with improvisation, and somehow, it turned out to be looking good. Maybe we just go on with the same style?"</p>
<p>Juri snorts at the memory. "True, but sorry to say that I'm not that fearless anymore," he remarks. He stands up and heads to the next room. Shintaro soon hears the sound of him rummaging around. Moments later, Juri returns with a black marker pen in his hand.</p>

<p>Juri commands Shintaro to tilt his head, and Shintaro kindly complies, stretching his neck and resting his cheek lightly against the couch cushion. He watches intently as Juri deftly removes the cap with his mouth, leaving it dangling between his teeth.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>"D'y'w'nt'thm r'ghtabov' th'prev'sones so'at th'rings'rtouchin', or'a bit'further?" Juri asks incomprehensibly, with the marker cap still in his mouth, the words all garbled.</p>
<p>Shintaro reaches out to snatch the cap away from Juri's mouth. "Care to repeat that, mister?"</p>
<p>"Do you want them right above the previous ones so that the rings are touching or a bit further?"</p>
<p>Shintaro shrugs, fiddling with the knob. "Well, I don't know. Whatever looks good, I guess."</p>
<p>Juri nods in agreement and bends forward. He gently takes Shintaro's left earlobe between his fingers, tapping it with the wet marker before leaning back slightly as if assessing the spot. "I think it would look good there, but maybe you should check it out in the mirror first."</p>
<p>Shintaro whips out his phone and opens the mirror app, using it to check the spot (Juri suggests a real mirror, but Shintaro waves him off). "Yeah, yeah, it's good enough. Let's roll with this one," he briskly decides. After all, Shintaro's the kind of guy who thinks longer about what to eat on that day rather than any life-changing decisions. So, they definitely shouldn't drag their feet on this one, either.</p>
<p>Juri smoothly repositions himself, a bit awkwardly bending over Shintaro's shoulder until he reaches Shintaro's right ear and repeats the same action.</p>
<p>Juri gestures for Shintaro to come closer and then firmly grips Shintaro's chin, holding his head steady with a determined expression etched across his face. It's one of those moments when Juri looks undeniably attractive. Shintaro can't help but admire him secretly because, seriously, what the hell? Juri's hair is pulled back into a neat bun, his arms bare, radiating a sun-kissed summer tan against the backdrop of his white t-shirt, and his golden jewelry harmonizing perfectly with his features. It's enough to make anyone do a double-take.</p>
<p>Juri's grip is firm, his fingers touching over Shintaro's chin, and their faint roughness sends a strange and somewhat alluring tingle down Shintaro's spine. It's a surprising feeling that leaves Shintaro somewhat baffled yet oddly captivated. Then again, he's always been aware of Juri's attractive qualities, so it's no surprise that the touch of such a good-looking friend can leave you feeling a bit bewildered.</p>
<p>Then, Shintaro's wandering thoughts are abruptly interrupted as Juri speaks up with a tone of realization in his voice. "You know what, I should probably take these old ones off before I go ahead with the new piercings."</p>

<p>His hands shift towards Shintaro's ear, expertly locating the earring. Sneaking his other hand behind Shintaro's earlobe, his touch sends another peculiar sensation racing through Shintaro's body - it's a curious mix of ticklishness and an oddly arousing feeling. That spot behind the ear is an area seldom touched by anyone, and the unexpected physical contact feels electrifying. But it's not just the touch that affects him. Shintaro can't help but notice the intense and focused expression on Juri's strikingly handsome face again, his brows furrowed in concentration. <br/><br/>As Juri deftly yanks and skillfully opens the earring lock with the tips of his fingers, Shintaro realizes that it's indeed an unexpected surge of real <em>arousal </em>he's feeling. Okay, this is definitely new.</p>

<p>Juri removes the earring from its hole and places it carefully on the coffee table alongside the new ones. Next, he reaches for a bottle at his feet and lightly sprays some cooling disinfectant on Shintaro's ear, following up with a gentle wipe using a damp disinfectant cloth. In the background, the sound of a needle package being torn open reaches Shintaro's ears.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As Shintaro's breath hitches, Juri notices his apparent nervousness. "Hey, you don't have to be nervous, Shintaro. It's just a quick pinch, and I promise I'll be gentle," he reassures, obviously not realizing the true source of Shintaro's anxiety. Because, to be honest, Shintaro's nerves have less to do with the pain and a lot more to do with the overwhelming feelings Juri's closeness and touch are causing. <br/><br/>Shintaro nods. "Yeah, just do it," he manages to say.</p>
<p>With a firm grip on Shintaro's ear, Juri begins a slow countdown: "Okay, one... two... three..."</p>
<p>And in that precise moment, he expertly guides the tubed needle through Shintaro's earlobe. Shintaro feels the quick, sharp feeling in his ear, confirming Juri's earlier promise. It's not a searing pain, it's only a brief, pinpoint pinch, almost as if a particularly pesky mosquito had decided to take a bite of it.</p>

<p>As Juri reaches for the table to grab a new earring and starts threading it through the needle inside the fresh hole, Shintaro can't resist stealing another glance. He observes Juri's intense concentration and furrowed brows, and once again, Shintaro can't help but think that Juri looks so incredibly attractive. The focused task at hand only adds to the excitement.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unable to contain himself, Shintaro blurts out: "You look so fucking hot when you do that."</p>
<p>Juri freezes. Shintaro freezes.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>The silence hangs awkwardly in the air.</p>
<p>Shintaro finally breaks it, his voice debased with embarrassment because he can never handle such scenarios for too long. "Okay, sorry, did I just make this really awkward?" He rolls his eyes slightly to catch a glimpse of Juri, who's still holding his ear. Suddenly, Shintaro feels a twinge of anxiety about what Juri might say in response.</p>
<p>Juri blinks, and he gently shakes his head. "No, no, no," he hustles to answer quickly. "It's not you. If anything, I might have made it awkward with my reaction." He chuckles lightly, trying to ease the tension. "I just... didn't expect that."</p>
<p>"Does it bother you?"</p>
<p>"Does it bother <em>you</em>?"</p>
<p>Another moment of silence stretches between them. Then, Juri signals for Shintaro to return his head to its earlier position. With a skilled and resolute hand, he successfully guides the earring through the freshly pierced hole, smoothly removing the needle tube.</p>
<p>"There you go," Juri mutters, leaning back to admire his handiwork.</p>
<p>Shintaro briefly believes they've managed to sidestep the awkward topic altogether, but as it turns out, Juri doesn't allow them to leave it hanging like that.</p>
<p>"It looks good on you," Juri continues, his words loaded with undeniable intent. "<em>Hot</em>," he emphasizes, drawing out each syllable, and Shintaro can't help but interpret this as a not-so-subtle invitation.</p>
<p>A flutter of excitement stirs deep within Shintaro's stomach again, and he can feel his heart thumping in his ears as he meets Juri's gaze. It's a moment charged with anticipation, and Shintaro decides that if this isn't a clear signal of a green light, then nothing is.</p>
<p>Luckily, Juri is on precisely the same track as him.</p>
<p>Juri gracefully descends from the couch, his movements quick and determined. Although it's just a matter of seconds, an electrifying charge of anticipation hangs in the air, waiting to explode at any moment. In silence, their hands search for the nape of each other's necks, drawing them closer until their lips meet in a heated, urgent kiss.</p>
<p>Their kiss intensifies at a quick pace. Desire courses through Shintaro's whole body, spinning his head and leaving him lightheaded from the overwhelming lust. Juri's lips are impatient, their slight dryness only adding to the fiery urgency as they eagerly explore Shintaro's mouth. A sense of urgency lingers as Juri's teeth graze Shintaro's lower lip before parting them, allowing his tongue to dive hungrily into Shintaro's mouth.</p>

<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words light">
<p>Without breaking their kiss, Juri's hand glides down Shintaro's body, and Shintaro tenderly strokes Juri's head. His other hand grips Juri's shoulder tightly. Juri's hand comes to rest on Shintaro's crotch, where he sensually massages him through his pants, teasing his already rock-hard member. Surprisingly soft and urgent sounds escape from Shintaro's lips, sounds he never expected to emit during such a heated moment with Juri.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Juri then moves a little bit again and slides onto Shintaro's lap, his knees spreading wide around Shintaro's hips. He presses him backward, their lips reconnecting in a scorching kiss. Shintaro's hands wander down Juri's sides, then over his waist and lower, boldly cupping his ass. Juri rocks down, grinding against him, and Shintaro feels wrecked by how good it feels.</p>
<p>As their lips part, they're left breathless. When Shintaro slowly opens his eyes, he's met with Juri's intense gaze - their faces tantalizingly close, noses almost touching, and Juri's fingers entangled in Shintaro's hair. The warm brown of Juri's eyes burns with a hunger that sets Shintaro's heart racing, and he can't help but think how unbelievably hot Juri looks again. It's as if a dormant switch has been suddenly activated, and Shintaro can't help but wonder why he didn't surrender to these feelings sooner. Were they always present, or did they genuinely require the act of 28-year-old Juri piercing his ear to surface?</p>

<p>"Shintaro—," Juri starts, and Shintaro nods in understanding. He complies as Juri moves slightly, letting Juri guide him to recline on the floor, his back against the smooth surface. With deliberate, seductive motions, Juri eases Shintaro's pants downward, disposing of them along with his underwear. The cool kiss of air-conditioned air caresses Shintaro's exposed skin, a sensation that briefly registers before being consumed by what follows.</p>

<p>Juri directs his arms under Shintaro's knees, encouraging him to part his legs. Then, with a tormenting slowness, he takes Shintaro's throbbing arousal into his mouth, bathing him in wetness and heat. Juri sets a scorching slow pace instantly, moving his exceptionally skilled mouth in and out with an enthusiasm that leaves Shintaro gasping for more.</p>

<p>Shintaro immediately knows he won't last long. Everything around becomes blurred. Juri maintains a teasingly slow rhythm with his mouth, bobbing his head back and forth. His warm hands venture beneath Shintaro's shirt, and he sensually explores Shintaro's bare stomach and sides with open palms, caressing the skin.</p>
<p>Shintaro's self-control slips away, his hands naturally finding their way to Juri's scalp, fingers entangled in his hair. Shintaro's actions dishevel Juri's neatly arranged bun, but in the throes of such pleasure, neither of them cares about that.</p>
<p>A low, involuntary groan escapes Shintaro's lips. Although he'd love to etch every detail of this enticing scene into his mental jerk-off archive for future reference, the overwhelming sensation forces him to toss his head back, creating a faint thump against the floor, followed by another deep gasp of pleasure. He closes his eyes.</p>

<p>As the sensation intensifies, Shintaro's breath hitches, and he can't hold back any longer. He feels himself reaching the peak, and Juri notices this as his lips immediately leave Shintaro's cock. Swiftly, Juri replaces his mouth with his hand, taking Shintaro's pulsating member in his grasp and skillfully coaxing him until he reaches a climax, releasing everything he has.</p>

<p>Both of them raise their heads in unison, their breaths heavy. Shintaro tightens his abdominal muscles as he gazes at Juri, who half-sits and half-lies between Shintaro's legs. Despite his appearance being utterly wrecked, an undeniable sensual gleam of <em>want</em> persists in his eyes.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, Shintaro sits up, carefully ensuring his sensitive cock avoids any unwanted friction. He seizes Juri by the neck, pulling him into another kiss, their lips crashing together with unrestrained hunger.</p>
<p>Shintaro's hand delves inside Juri's pants, finding his stiff member and initiating a tantalizing stroking rhythm. He can't help but observe that Juri's cock feels different in his grasp compared to his own, and the contrast somehow makes the situation even more arousing.</p>
<p>Shintaro continues to stroke Juri, the warmth of his own orgasm still lingering, and he feels out of breath. Then, a thought crosses Shintaro's mind. He ponders if Juri desires even more, if Juri wants to fuck him. After a brief internal debate, Shintaro decides it's best to ask directly.</p>
<p>"Hey," he begins, his voice husky, "do you want... more?" Shintaro's eyes lock onto Juri's.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Yeah, I do," Juri replies with a hungry look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Shintaro slowly withdraws his hand from Juri's pants, allowing him to remove them with ease. Juri casually tosses his pants onto the couch, leaving his lower half exposed, mirroring Shintaro's state. Shintaro's gaze naturally gravitates towards Juri's groin, and he can't help but notice the stark difference in how Juri's cock appears when it's fully erect. While Shintaro has seen Juri fully naked numerous times, this situation feels very different.</p>
<p>They clutch each other's shoulders and engage in another kiss, with Juri playfully flicking Shintaro's lower lip with his tongue. Shintaro is on the verge of suggesting they should get some supplies if Juri really wants to go further and fuck him, but before he can speak, Juri shifts closer. His crotch hovers over Shintaro's thigh, and he begins to rub himself sensually against it, causing Shintaro's breath to catch in his throat from surprise. Oh. This is what Juri was referring to with 'something more'. <br/><br/>Okay then.</p>
<p>Juri occasionally breaks their kiss for brief moments, needing to catch his breath. His hot-aired exhales mingle with Shintaro's breath, their lips hovering close. He maintains his rhythmic rubbing against Shintaro's thigh, growing more fervent until he reaches his climax. Shintaro feels wet and warm sperm spreading on his thigh, and Juri lets out unrestrained grunts of pleasure. Shintaro pulls Juri closer, wrapping his arms around him and pressing kisses to his sweaty neck, allowing him to ride out his orgasm until the end.</p>
<p>With the intense moment of lust fading, they slowly separate from their heated embrace. Juri, however, avoids locking eyes with Shintaro and wears a slightly embarrassed expression, an unusual sight for someone as confident as him.</p>
<p>"Ummmm, I think I should go to the toilet," Juri mutters, looking away and leaving Shintaro momentarily puzzled.</p>

<p>Shintaro can't help but wonder what just happened. Did they truly get so aroused by the act of piercing, ultimately leading to an unexpected grinding and blowjob on the floor like a couple of horny teenagers? This scenario was undoubtedly not part of their original plan for the piercing session, Shintaro swears. Now, there's one pressing question on his mind: is this going to be awkward? Shintaro hopes not, especially with Juri, of all people. Maybe he can be just honest about it right away.</p>

<p>"Okay, did you forget our plan to take the piercing game to the next level?" Shintaro asks, his fingers gently encircling Juri's hand, offering a reassuring squeeze. "So, let's not turn this into an awkward teenage moment?" he continues softly. He means every word.</p>
<p>Juri quickly eases into a relaxed posture and returns the smile, squeezing Shintaro's hand back. Okay, still on the same track. That's good. Everything starkly contrasts their younger, more impulsive selves, who might not have handled similar situations with as much finesse.</p>

<p>Then they take turns, quietly tiptoeing to the toilet with their pants in hand, and return looking considerably more composed.</p>
<p>When Juri is back (his hair tied back again) and sits down next to Shintaro on the sofa, he clearly ponders momentarily before he opens his mouth. "So, I want to ask this clearly just to be sure: does this bother you?"</p>
<p>"Does this bother <em>you</em>?" Shintaro responds with a question of his own, a shared smile passing between them as they acknowledge Shintaro's reference to their earlier conversation.</p>
<p>Juri shakes his head. "No, because I'd be lying if I told you I hadn't thought about that before, and you kind of made it easy for me to take this step," he admits. Then, he grins and adds, "Damn, Morimoto, that was the hottest thing I've experienced all year."</p>
<p>"Well Tanaka, I feel the same way," Shintaro responds, his gaze then shifting to the silver piercings on the coffee table. "What do you say: are you still up for making that other piercing for me? Let's not stop here."</p>
<p>Juri smirks. "But what if you get a hard-on again? Do you like the pain that much, or is it just me that excites you that much?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's a bit of both, and there's only one way to truly find out," Shintaro says and can't help smirking back. He turns to Juri and wraps an arm around his shoulder, lightly tracing Juri's arm with his fingers. "So, ready for round two?"</p>
<p>"I'd be crazy if I said no to that."</p>
