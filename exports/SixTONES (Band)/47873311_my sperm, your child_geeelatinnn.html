        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Happy birthday, Tanaka Juri!</p><p>This is going to be different from my other Juri birthday fics because in this one, he does not celebrate his birthday,</p><p>I had the random idea of him being a sperm donor, unfortunately, I was not able to compress it in just one chapter because I wanted to make it to his birthday. Anyway, this will have multiple chapters instead but it won't be as long as my other works.</p><p>I know his birthday is on the 15th but I wanted to post it at Japan's timezone's midnight so my posted date will be a little off (also, I drafted it on my laptop before i packed up for sleep because it's a workday)</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">my sperm, your child</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>"Juri!" Jesse raised up his hand to call Juri over the alfresco table he had reserved for them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a nice autumn afternoon. It was not too hot nor was it too cold. The temperature was just right for alfresco dining.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, better here than have you shouting inside." Juri chuckled as he took a seat. His attention immediately shifted from Jesse to the menu on the table. Before engaging in any further conversation with Jesse, Juri called over the waiter to take his order first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Juri, you'll never believe what I found out today."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri groaned. "If this is another Hokuto fact, please keep it to yourself."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course, it's not! Hokuto had never donated his sperm at a sperm bank."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You see," Jesse folded his arms on top of the table. "I went with my sister and her friend to the sperm bank. They were both too shy to inquire on their own so they took me with them. Guess whose name I saw in the roster of donors?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ah, so you found out about my little secret, huh?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Little? Little?! You donated sperm to be used by people who want a kid but can't make a kid!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah. So? Don't make it sound like a crime, Jesse. It's perfectly legal to be a sperm donor. I even provided an extended donor profile."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jesse shook his head in amusement. "Haven't you ever thought that there might be a child running around the city, carrying your DNA?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The waiter was clearly taken aback while putting down Juri's order but tried his hardest not to slip up and show his further reaction to what he had just overheard. He bowed slightly at Juri before leaving the two be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Why'd you even do it?" Jesse asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"A friend of mine applied for a job there, way way back. But he was having trouble getting donors. So, I did him a favor and donated my sperm. Why, do you want some of it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ew no! I have plenty of my own thank you very much. Hokuto is very well endowed in that department too."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Ew." Juri made a fake gagging sound. "I don't need to know details of your sex life."</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>In all honesty, Juri had never thought about it that far. That there could be a kid around the city running around with his DNA. He never inquired about whether someone has chosen his donated sperm or not. The idea of donating sperm never sounded absurd to him until Jesse spoke his mind about how silly it sounded that Juri would do such a thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of going back to his recording studio to check on things, Juri pulled over to the nearest park where kids usually played. Standing there, he felt like a sore thumb that stuck out. Parents and guardians were chatting in the benches while they watch the kids they came with. Some kids were having some sort of snack with the adult that came with them. Their faces were painted with smiles and laughs, it was as though the park was a picture of happiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This made Juri think that it might not be such a bad idea to have a child. But he knew in his heart that he was not ready for all the other responsibilities and commitment that came with actually having one of his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as he was about to turn around to leave, someone bumped into his legs and he heard a thud. A child fell on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry,” Juri squatted down to the level of the child and helped him out, he kept his position and stayed at eye level with the kid. A strange rush flowed in his body as he looked at the child’s eyes. Maybe it was just Jesse’s words messing with him, but Juri really thinks that this random kid’s eyes seem just like his.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa!” The child’s shout threw Juri out of his trance and he realized he was still holding the child’s shoulder. The child gripped on Juri’s shirt. “Papa! Papa’s missing!” Tears started to well around the child’s eyes. “Papa!” he wailed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri looked around, bowing his head a little when he makes eye contact with anyone that meets his eyes. The people were looking at both of them and it was making Juri a little nervous. But he can’t abandon the child, not now when he was crying his eyes out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t cry little one,” Juri took out his handkerchief and wiped off the tears of the child. “This uncle will help you look for your papa.” Paying more attention to the child’s features, Juri noticed the shape of the child’s lips was almost the same as his. The only thing he noticed differences between their faces was that the child had a pale complexion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Da-daddy?” The child sounded genuinely confused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri let out a light laugh. “No, no. Uncle. Not daddy, okay?” The child nodded. Juri dusted off the sand that clung to the child’s shorts and legs from his fall earlier. He stood up to his full height and held the child’s hand. The child was looking at him with hopeful eyes. Despite the hesitation he has about taking the child with him to look for his father, Juri tried to muster up a smile to give some assurance to the child that he could trust him. “We’ll find your papa, little one. Maybe he had not gone far.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Haru!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child tugged on Juri’s hand before running towards the person who called out the name. “Papa!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man dropped the paper bags in his hand to welcome the little child into his arms. Judging by his looks, Juri guessed the man was about his age. He embraced the crying child in his arms and seemed really relieved to find him. They shared the same pale skin but that was it as far as Juri could see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, Haru. Papa’s here.” The man caressed Haru’s back. From the looks of it, it was not just the child who was in panic, the father seemed to be shaking too. “Papa’s here. Papa’s sorry. Papa won’t leave you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If his ears were not failing him, Juri thought he could hear the man’s voice breaking but trying to keep his calm for the child. Juri felt like he was intruding on a very intimate moment between a father and a child. At the same time, he thought the scene looked straight out of a movie scene. He also does not know if he should leave without telling the child or if the child even remembered him at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah! Papa!” Haru said before pulling away from his father’s embrace. “Daddy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri choked on air but luckily he was able to compose himself before Haru turned around and ran towards him. Haru held his pants and pointed to Juri and the man alternately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daddy! Papa!” Haru said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tanaka Juri.” The man caught himself say and clamped his mouth with his hand. His eyes widened as though he had just said something that he should not have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Haru looked up to Juri with wide expectant eyes. “Daddy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri nervously laughed it off. “Haru, right?” he squatted down to level with Haru. “You found your papa! Aren’t you glad? Uncle,” Juri put emphasis on the word. “Let’s help your papa with the things that fell on the ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Un!” Haru ran over to the man and he and Juri helped out with picking up some of the stuff that fell out of the grocery bags.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry about that.” The man said while avoiding eye contact with Juri.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How come you know my name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You caught that, huh?” The man nervously chuckled. He bit down on his lip, hesitation clearly seen on his face. “Haru,” he called over the child. “Why don’t you play with the other kids for a bit? Papa and this uncle will just chat for a bit at the benches over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Un!” Haru nodded and ran toward where the children were playing together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri helped out the man with the grocery bags as they walked over to an empty bench. Silence was shared between them for a bit, both looking at Haru playing with the rest of the kids.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man let out a heavy sigh. “Before anything else, just to be fair, you should know my name too. I’m Kyomoto Taiga. Haru… Kyomoto Hatsuharu is my child but… technically you’re his father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that why he calls me daddy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taiga shook his head. “He doesn’t know because things are… complicated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Complicated?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was clear from the expression on Taiga's face that he was trying to piece together his thoughts before he talked but he just could not figure out how exactly. “Well, I recognized you from you profile. Your profile from the sperm bank. Haru’s the product of your sperm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Juri stood up and looked at Taiga. “Haru’s…” he looked towards Haru who was happily playing with the other children. It was no wonder they had similar features, Haru is a product of his sperm after all. “Haru has my DNA?” Juri’s heart tightened for a second. Looking at Haru, a feeling of ease washed away his shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. But I never tried to contact you about him despite it being allowed as said in your file. Since, you know, I wasn’t sure if it was any of your business.” Taiga sounded blunt but his expression looked lost. “Now that you know… if you want to be part of Haru’s life, I can give you my contact.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa! Daddy!” Haru ran over to them. He hugged Juri’s legs. “Papa! Can daddy eat dinner with us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Haru. Stop calling him daddy.” Taiga nervously chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can call me Juri, Haru.” Juri picked up Haru and carried him in his arms. “What do you want to eat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Papa cooks!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri blinked twice. They were all practically strangers after all despite he and Haru sharing DNA. It was too sudden for him to come over to their place and have dinner. But the decision ultimately falls to the father-child duo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, if Tanaka-san doesn't mind a home-cooked dinner." Taiga scratched the back of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uhm, I'm alright. I brought my car. Do you guys need a ride?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that’s great! I don’t drive.” Taiga laughed it off as if it was nothing at all. As if he wasn’t admitting something to someone who was technically a stranger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As a smile spread in Taiga’s face, something tugged on Juri’s heartstrings. With his mind no longer occupied by thoughts of why he shared some similar features with Haru, Juri only noticed Taiga’s looks. Taiga’s cheeks puffed out as he smiled and Juri found it adorable. Looking at him closely, Taiga is beautiful, a delicate kind of beauty. Juri had to remind himself that he was there for the child, not the father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taiga and Haru had to take the backseats as Juri’s car did not have a child’s seat. To Juri’s surprise, Taiga directed them towards an area known to have expensive houses. To add to it, Taiga told him to pull over in front of a house, not an apartment complex but a full-blown house. Taiga got off to open the driveway gate to Juri and help him park his car inside. There was another car parked there despite Taiga saying that he does not drive. There is a garden leading up to the house that seemed to be properly taken care off. Different colored flowers bloomed but Juri was no knowledgeable enough about flowers to know what exactly they were.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juri!” Haru extended his hands to Juri as they both got off the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri carried the child in his arms and Taiga carried the groceries as they made their way inside the house. It was a two-story house that was probably four times the size of Juri’s humble apartment. He did not get a moment to even take in how spacious the house seemed as Haru was already dragging him to the wing of the house where his toys where. Half of the floor space of the living room was occupied by shelves of toys. There was even a small slide at the far left of the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Haru pulled on Juri and gestured for him to sit in the area where his toy cars were stored. Juri just followed whatever Haru wanted. The child has an excited smile on his face, already giggling as he pulled one of the boxes on the shelves. Haru dragged the box near Juri, putting it in between the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juri! Cars!” Haru excitedly pulled a car from the box. “Cars! Cars!” He pulled out one car after another. He placed them down beside him and Juri. “Juri! Cars!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri could tell the toy cars were on the pricier side, just holding them and feeling their weight, one could already tell it was different from what kids normally played with. He thought the child must not be aware of it, otherwise, Haru would not be putting it down on the floor with such force.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri felt a little uneasy if it was alright that they were taking out one toy after another. Haru’s laugh filled the room, they could even barely hear the noise from the kitchen where Taiga was cooking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Haru yawned and stretched his arms in the middle of them building a sort of highway full of cars. He crawled towards Juri and got in between his legs. Haru leaned his body on Juri’s and closed his eyes. Juri wrapped his arms around Haru, adjusting the child’s position into something more comfortable. Thankfully, there was a sofa near the play pit. Juri gently picked up Haru. He sat down on the sofa and leaned back, Haru was still in his arms as he thought the child might wake up if it felt that he was left alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri had always loved kids. But he does not see himself having any of his own soon. With Haru sleeping so soundly in his arms, breathing steady, and clinging on to his shirt, the child looks so precious. A feeling of wanting to protect him came over Juri.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this was not his child. He may be the one responsible for the sperm that made him, but he was not the one who was raising him. Taiga is. Taiga is Haru’s father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He ran around so much that it’s not surprising he fell asleep,” Taiga said in a soft voice as he sat down on the same sofa, keeping a safe distance between him and Juri. “He must really like you. He rarely talks to strangers. But with you… I heard his laughs from the kitchen, thank you for playing with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri kept his gaze on Haru. “I’m very sorry to intrude, Kyomoto-san.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Taiga. Feel free to call me Taiga.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then, please call me Juri.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juri. The chicken will be cooked in ten minutes. I’ll wake up Haru by then.” Taiga stood up and headed for the pit. He carefully picked up the toys and put them back in their boxes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Won’t Haru be fuzzy if we wake him up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh he will be,” Taiga chuckled. “That’s why I’ll wake him up. If there will be any hair pulling, it’ll be better if its mine rather than our guest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the chicken cooked, Taiga set the table before waking Haru in Juri’s arms. They were able to avoid any form of hair pulling. Haru was fuzzy but he was angry only at Taiga and clung to Juri. Juri and Taiga even had to switch seats in the dining table because Haru kept pushing Taiga away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Juri! Haru birthday. Juri come!” Haru had mashed potato all over his mouth as he talked. “Haru birthday!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Juri glanced over at Taiga who nodded at him. “Juri will come. When is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Friday! Juri, Papa, preschool Haru! Papa cooks. Haru birthday!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll bring the cake then.”</span>
