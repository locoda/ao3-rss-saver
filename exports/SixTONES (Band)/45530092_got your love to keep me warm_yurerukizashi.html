    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>The ticket booth is still closed when Jesse arrives at the station. He looks at the time and is surprised to learn that he still has fifteen minutes left until six in the morning. He might have overestimated how long the lines could be for buying tickets for the bullet train, but then again, it’s the weekday.</p><p>Jesse fishes out his phone and opens LINE, checking the unread messages. No message from Yugo, the latest one being minutes ago, informing him that he’s on his way. He should be here in ten minutes, more or less.</p><p>“Jesse?”</p><p>His heart leaps as he looks at the direction of the voice. Yugo is standing there, wearing a beanie and a black leather jacket and holding a black duffel bag. He has an eyebrow raised, and Jesse bites his lip to suppress a laugh before raising a hand to wave in greeting.</p><p>“You’re early,” Yugo remarks when he nears.</p><p>Jesse grins, looking around before pecking Yugo on the cheek. “Is that a bad thing?”</p><p>“You’re never on time at work,” Yugo points out, warmth rushing to his cheeks.</p><p>“Can’t help it. I’m excited for this.” He takes Yugo’s bag and plops it on the bench next to his own weekender bag.</p><p>Yugo then scoffs before looking at him from head to toe. “What are you wearing?”</p><p>Jesse’s just wearing a thin, knitted jumper — the color a little too toned down for his liking, but he doesn’t want to stand out this time — and jeans. He shrugs. “It’s not <em>that</em> cold anymore.”</p><p>“You did check the weather before packing here, though.”</p><p>Hokuto <em>did</em> remind him a couple of hours ago to bring a scarf and a jacket, both folded neatly inside his weekender bag. “I’ll be fine,” he assures him, sitting down.  </p><p>Finally, the ticket booth opens, and Yugo heads there immediately, being first in line, while Jesse waits by the nearby benches. He opens his chat with his manager and messages him that he and Yugo are at the station. His manager just gives a thumbs-up emoji in response, then a message reminding them that they have to be on time for check-in in Aichi.</p><p>And then a “Have fun” and a wink emoji.</p><p>Even their group chat is filled with messages telling them to have fun and stay “safe” (Shintaro), and warmth just spreads to his chest just thinking about the many people who support them for this.</p><p>This trip to Gifu has been a long time coming, after all. It had taken Jesse weeks of bugging Yugo, the manager, the higher-ups, and everyone else in between to make this happen. And now it’s happening.</p><p>“Jesse?”</p><p>Jesse looks up from his phone and finds Yugo standing in front of him, holding out their tickets. “You want your ticket or you want me to keep them?” he asks.</p><p>“Oh, you can keep them for now,” he says, standing up. He holds out his hand. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Yugo smiles and takes Jesse’s hand. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>A train ride to Nagoya, a one-hour wait in Nagoya station, and probably three hours on the bullet train, they make it to Takayama. The city is blanketed in snow, covering the traditional-styled houses and streets. Jesse feels like he had just gone back in time.</p><p>“Well,” he says, breathless. His grip on Yugo’s hand is tight. “Here we are.”</p><p>“It’s better than I ever imagined.” Yugo’s eyes are wide. He tugs Jesse forward as he steps out of the station, scanning their surroundings. “Where do we even begin?”</p><p>They didn’t have the time to plan an itinerary. Jesse and Yugo figured they could just note down some places they’d like to go to and then just wing it. Jesse checks his phone and opens his Maps app. “How about the shrine you said you wanted to go to?”</p><p>“Really?” Yugo’s face lights up. “That’s a bus ride away.”</p><p>Jesse shrugs. “We’re not in a hurry.” They’re not set to check in at their hotel until 3 p.m. anyway.</p><p>The smile on Yugo’s face is worth the suggestion anyway.</p><p>Hie Shrine is blanketed with snow by the time they arrive, and it’s then that Jesse starts to shiver. He curses himself for not actually taking out his scarf and jacket from his bag, but they had boarded the bus by the time he remembered about it.</p><p>He doesn’t have the time to worry about that, though. Yugo skips toward the shrine as soon as they arrive, and Jesse soaks up the sight as he trails behind.</p><p>“It’s just how I saw it in the movie … maybe minus the snow.” Yugo already has his phone out, snapping photos. Jesse’s photo vibrates, and when he checks, Yugo had sent the photo to their group chat. In a matter of seconds, Juri had tagged Hokuto and Shintaro remarking that Juri tagged the wrong Shinkai lead.</p><p>At least the walk up to the shrine doesn’t look so bad. Past the iconic red gates, they’re met by hundreds of steps. Jesse guesses he can still tolerate the cold at this rate.</p><p>But he doesn’t get past Yugo, who sighs and puts his phone in his pocket. “I told you to bundle up,” he chastises, his gloved hand reaching for Jesse’s. He stuffs their hands in his pocket. “Everyone’s gonna kill me if I bring you back with hypothermia.”</p><p>“You’re here to keep me warm, though,” Jesse points out with a grin.</p><p>Yugo rolls his eyes. “You’re lucky I love you enough. You think you can go up without dying from the cold?”</p><p>“Of course.” Jesse’s heart leaps upon hearing <em>that</em> word. He’s heard it a lot of times from Yugo’s lips, but it never fails to make his heart leap and his toes curl. “Lead the way.”</p><p>Once they reach the shrine, they ring the bell and pay their respects. Jesse is the first to finish making a wish (it’s just the usual anyway — SixTONES’ success, individual projects for members, a lifetime with Yugo) so he could watch Yugo with his eyes closed in solemn prayer.</p><p>When Yugo opens his eyes and notices Jesse, he pouts and looks away, cheeks red. “You’re creepy,” he mumbles. He reaches for Jesse’s hand again.</p><p>Maybe the cold isn’t always so bad.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time they descend the shrine, Jesse’s stomach starts to grumble. Yugo laughs and suggests they grab Jesse’s coat and scarf in the locker before looking for someplace to eat.</p><p>They settle in a small, traditional restaurant. The waitress blinks at them in recognition before ushering them inside. Jesse looks over his shoulder to find her taking out a sign that says “RESERVED” before heading outside.</p><p>The place is practically empty, but it’s a warm, wonderful escape from the snow outside. They pick a place by the windows, and Jesse sighs in relief as he feels the warmth of the <em>zabuton</em>.</p><p>“You okay?” Yugo asks, brushing snow off Jesse’s hair as a waiter sets a menu on their table.</p><p>Jesse smiles and nods. “We’re someplace warm now.”</p><p>“The next time we visit, I’m going to nag you until you actually put on a coat and a scarf.”</p><p>“Okay.” Jesse grins at the possibility of a <em>next time</em>.</p><p>Despite closing the restaurant for them, the staff makes sure they are comfortable. The waitress chats with them and gushes about watching one of their concerts last year. They offer side dishes on the house, but Jesse and Yugo insist on paying — it’s their way of thanks for giving them privacy.</p><p>The food is amazing, too — fresh and filling. That much, they tell the staff as they clear their empty plates.</p><p>“Where to now?” Yugo asks, stretching. They still have an hour to go before they can check in their hotel.</p><p>Jesse yawns. He hadn’t slept a wink last night — he was too excited this trip was happening — and he hadn’t napped properly during the train ride. “We could walk around,” he suggests, though all he wants is to lie down right now.</p><p>Yugo looks at him and hums in understanding. “Nap,” he orders, patting his thigh.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Jesse yawns again.</p><p>“I could use some dessert anyway.”</p><p>“Not too sweet.”</p><p>Yugo rolls his eyes. “Joke’s on you, because I’m sneaking in something sweet while you’re asleep.”</p><p>Jesse laughs, shifting so he could lie down and prop his head on Yugo’s lap. Yugo is warm, and he’s Jesse’s favorite pillow. That much he learned whenever he would nap on long car rides. Or even when Jesse has an actual pillow to use at the hotel. Nothing beats Yugo’s warmth.</p><p>The heat of the <em>zabuton</em> and Yugo’s own body heat — plus Yugo playing with his hair — has him drifting off in a matter of minutes with a smile on his face.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The village has become more crowded when Yugo and Jesse leave the restaurant. They put on their masks, looking over their shoulders now and then just in case someone recognizes them. It’s one thing to be recognized in a private space, but it’s another thing when they’re outside, where people can easily take out their phones and snap a photo of them.</p><p>“Where to now?” Yugo asks. They were distracted by a food stall, and they’re lucky there’s still room in their stomachs despite having a full meal at the restaurant earlier.</p><p>“How about this place?” Jesse pulls out his Maps app and shows the photo of the location to Yugo. He had watched a YouTube video somewhere on how this is an underrated place in Takayama, so the chances of fewer people being around them are high. “It’s a bus ride away, though.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes widen, his lips pulling back in a brilliant smile that will stay in Jesse’s memories forever. “Okay.”</p><p>They head to the hotel first to drop off their bags before check-in then buy a ticket for the bus that would take them to the limestone caves. They’re the only people in the bus, giving Jesse more hope that the place would be just as quiet.</p><p>Luckily for them, the place is quiet. As expected, someone from the staff recognizes them and heads inside to seemingly call for their manager. Jesse pretends not to notice as they look for the directions to the cave.</p><p>They both gasp as they enter the cave, the stalactites illuminated by purple light. It makes Jesse feel like he was transported into a different world.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” Yugo says, breathless.</p><p>Jesse intertwines their fingers. “Yeah, it is.”</p><p>They walk through the bridge of the cave, occasionally snapping photos of the place and of themselves. Soon, they find themselves in areas of the cave with weirdly shaped stalactites with labels as to the things they’re supposed to form. Jesse finds everything fascinating, especially the stalactite shaped like a castle.</p><p>After minutes of walking, they reach a tunnel, and Jesse laughs when he reads the label next to it. “It’s called the ‘Love Deepening Spot,’” he reads out loud. “They say when a couple passes inside, their love deepens.”</p><p>“How cheesy can you get?”</p><p>“It’s the only way out, though,” Jesse points out, reaching for Yugo’s hand. “Besides, you don’t want to do this for us?”</p><p>Yugo laughs. “You picked this place because of this, didn’t you?”</p><p><em>He did. </em>“Maybe.” Jesse shrugs. “And the surprise at the exit?”</p><p>“At the exit?” Yugo asks, tilting his head curiously. “Guess I have no choice, then.”</p><p>The tunnel isn’t in any way romantic except for the deep purple lights that are supposed to enhance the romantic mood of it all. Still, Jesse’s not complaining. He sways their hands as they pass inside the tunnel, humming a song. Yugo eventually hums along with him, and Jesse feels a spring in his step.</p><p>Eventually, they reach the end of the tunnel, where a small shrine stands and some directions toward the exit. “I thought you said there was a surprise,” Yugo whines.</p><p>“This isn’t the exit, though.” Jesse points to the signage. “We gotta go up there.”</p><p>“No.” Yugo shakes his head, crossing his arms. “Too steep.”</p><p>An idea pops in Jesse’s head, and he smirks as he scoops Yugo into his arms, bridal-style.</p><p>“Wha—Jesse!” Yugo shrieks, arms wrapping around Jesse’s neck. “<em>What are you doing</em>?”</p><p>He laughs, warmth spreading through his chest. “We’re going up,” he declares, as he takes the first step.</p><p>The flight of stairs is steep, and he’s glad that he had been working out these past few months. They make it to the top in no time, the dim lights giving way to natural light streaming out of the wide windows of what looks like an observation deck.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Yugo gasps as Jesse puts him down. He runs to the wide window giving them a view of a wall of stalactites from outside. “This really exists here?”</p><p>“Yup.” Jesse walks toward Yugo, taking in the view himself. “Makes the hike up worth it, huh?”</p><p>Yugo chuckles. “<em>You</em> did all the hiking.” He tugs at Jesse’s sleeve. “You okay, though?”</p><p>Jesse takes a couple of seconds to look at the magical view before them before looking at Yugo, who’s just as magical. He smiles as he leans down, a hand cupping Yugo’s cheek. “Yeah, more than okay.”</p><p>“Good.” Yugo smiles, closing his eyes as he leans forward.</p><p>Jesse brushes their lips together then pulls away for a couple of seconds, letting the moment linger before diving into the kiss again. It’s precisely this place, this moment, why he had wanted to go here, and he got what he wanted and more.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jesse doesn’t want the day to end. The next morning would mean checking out of their accommodation and being back to Tokyo. It meant returning to reality — to concert rehearsals and individual projects that would mean less time alone with Yugo.</p><p>After leaving the limestone caves, they explore the city some more — making bamboo lamps and visiting too many food stalls to mention. By the time they arrive at the hotel to finally check in, the sun had already set.</p><p>At least the room is already made up and the staff had announced that they would leave their dinner after their bath. They shrug in the hotel robes and then step out of their room to look for the bath.</p><p>The private bath gives them a view of the snow-filled village. Jesse sighs as warmth fills his body, even more so when Yugo slides next to him.</p><p>“Can we stay for one more day?” Yugo asks, plopping his towel on top of his head.</p><p>Jesse laughs. “Says the responsible one.”</p><p>“It’s not like our concert’s tomorrow.” Yugo pouts, watching the snow fall from their warm space in the bath. “I really like it here. I don’t want it to end.”</p><p>“Me, too.” Jesse leans until their heads are touching, a gesture that Jesse seems to like because it’s <em>just theirs</em>. “But we have a few more prefectures to go, don’t we?”</p><p>Yugo moves his head to the side to kiss Jesse’s cheek. “Yeah.”</p><p>They decide to emerge from the bath after seeing their fingers wrinkle, and they return to their room, feeling refreshed. As promised, the staff had their dinner spread out before them, a bottle of sake on the table.</p><p>Not wanting to keep the food cold, they sit down after dropping their towels on the laundry basket. Jesse pours the sake for them, and they toast to the end of their Gifu trip and many other reasons to celebrate.</p><p>“Okay, I think that’s enough,” Jesse laughs as he reaches for their half-empty bottle just as Yugo tries to pour himself another cup. “We are not waking up with a hangover.”</p><p>“I hate you.” Yugo hiccups and pouts. “Why are you still sober?”</p><p>“I have very good alcohol tolerance.” Jesse gets up and pulls Yugo up as well. “Come on, Yugo, bedroom. Time to get changed.”</p><p>Yugo wraps his arms around Jesse. “Can we stay like this? Five minutes.”</p><p>“Five minutes.” Jesse chuckles, returning the embrace. When Yugo is this clingy, it’s really hard to resist.</p><p>Yugo is warm, small against his frame, slotting into his body as if it’s meant to fit there. He smells of the shampoo that the owner of the hut had stocked in those huge bottles. Jesse would do anything to be in this embrace for longer than five minutes, but if it’s any relief, it’s that Yugo will always embrace him like this.</p><p>He presses a kiss on the top of Yugo’s head. Yugo looks up and goes on his tiptoes, pressing his lips to Jesse’s, warm and soft at their core, but with a cool wetness on the surface, with a faint taste of the cranberry from one of the drinks they had a couple of hours ago.</p><p>Jesse pulls Yugo against him until their bodies are as close as they can be. When Yugo lets out a sigh as they pull apart, Jesse lifts him easily, shifting to the backs of his thighs as Yugo wraps his legs around his waist.</p><p>He carries Yugo easily, like he’s weightless, through the living room to the bedroom.</p><p>“Fuck, Yugo,” Jesse exhales, kissing him again. Every kiss is heavier, more desperate. They’ve been together for years now, but this moment — and the moments before it — are never enough. Heck, it would take a lifetime, and Jesse would never get enough of being this close to Yugo.</p><p>Yugo nuzzles into his neck as Jesse drops him gently on the bed. They discard their clothes as fast as they can, thanking the heavens that they actually got rid of their day clothes and changed into their pajamas before having their drink. Jesse sighs as he traces his fingers over Yugo’s clavicles.</p><p>God, he’s <em>beautiful</em>. “You’re so beautiful,” Jesse says against his skin, kissing a line down Yugo’s chest.</p><p>Yugo makes a sound that sends a flood of heat to his navel. Jesse can’t wait to hear him unravel for him, to <em>watch</em> him unravel as if it’s the first time again.</p><p>“You gonna be okay?” he asks, fingers already playing over the skin of Yugo’s thighs, gaze up at Yugo’s dark eyes.</p><p>“Yeah.” Yugo smiles, full of love.</p><p>Jesse laughs as he moves back up to reclaim Yugo’s lips.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“I’m thirsty,” Yugo murmurs.</p><p>The whole room is hot. Jesse wonders if he should go adjust the air conditioning, but Yugo is settled back against Jesse, framed between his legs, and he probably won’t be moving any time soon. Besides, his head is a little dazed in the post-sex haze.</p><p>“That’s what you get for drinking too much.”</p><p>“Says you.” Yugo closes his eyes and twists onto his side so he could curl up against Jesse. “That was amazing.”</p><p>“<em>You’re</em> amazing.” Jesse smiles. He tilts sideways to kiss Yugo’s cheek. “Do you want me to get you water?”</p><p>“And leave me?” Yugo pouts.</p><p>“It’s gonna hurt in the morning, babe. And the kitchen is five steps away.”</p><p>“Five steps too far.”</p><p>Jesse hums a sound of agreement. “If you say so.”</p><p>“Jesse”</p><p>Jesse looks down at Yugo. “Yeah?”</p><p>Yugo shifts against him. “Thank you.”</p><p>Jesse laughs softly, happiness radiating from his heart to his fingertips. “Still up for our next trip in another prefecture?”</p><p>“Jesse Lewis,” Yugo says, moving up to peck his nose. “I think it goes without saying that I’m stuck with you, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” He sits up. “And I’m really thirsty, so I’m gonna get a glass of water now.” He heads up, but not before skipping back to kiss Jesse one more time.</p><p>Jesse sits up, watching his boyfriend shrug on his robe before heading to the kitchen.</p><p>He can’t help but think that the entire trip worked out so well.</p>
