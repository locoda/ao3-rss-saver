<span>“Why do you have to hide here?”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“I have to stay far from him,” Yugo whispered in Juri’s ear and the latter shivered at the cold breath against his skin. “I’ll do anything. Shelter me.”</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Juri’s lips extended to his ears, a smile that meant everything and at this point, Yugo didn’t care at all. If Juri wanted sex in exchange for his protection, Yugo would give it to him. He needed it too. He needed a distraction that would make him stop thinking about how he turned someone that wasn’t meant to be turned.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>He spoiled the innocent, and wasted a human life.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>He regretted his gesture but before he could stop, it was already too late. He just ran away.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>But </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was who </span>
<em>
<span>they</span>
</em>
<span> were. In constant hunger and thirst. It was a characteristic trait of them.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Juri wasn’t turned yet, but he was almost one. He was one of those kids everyone hated because they belonged to none of those races. He was one of those who would flirt with limits.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Juri was always on the edge of everything, although he didn’t ask to be a half. He was the forbidden product of a monster and a human. He didn’t need blood to survive but he was so attracted to it that it made him particularly aggressive.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>It was on a sunny day that Juri met Yugo. He was found wandering around, trying to die out of hunger and not knowing where to go, what to do when he had no guidance and no friend, only enemies who wanted him dead. Yugo turned his head at the right moment and spotted him inadvertently crossing the road before plunging in his direction, saving him from being hit by a car. It was a dramatic meeting but Yugo was the first to reach his hand to him and since then, Juri didn’t let go of it. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>He was his savior.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Thus, if Yugo asked, Juri provided him with anything.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yugo never asked a thing though. But because Juri owed him his life, he’d always pay back.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Usually, it was sex. And a little of his forbidden mature blood.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yugo seemed to distribute it everywhere as if he was leaving footprints trailing behind him. His blood wasn’t precious anyway, the ones that should cherish their blood were humans and Juri was half-human. When Yugo drank from him, it had a bitter tint in the vermilion honey-textured blood, it was different from Taiga’s mature taste or Jesse’s intoxicating sugary scent. It was another kind. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>If Yugo collected tastes in his memory, he couldn’t keep these physically. He could only spend short moments with them to taste it again and again.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>When Juri agreed to let him stay at his apartment, Yugo was relieved to see no one else there. How awkward would it be if Juri had to throw someone away for him. He didn’t seek to be taken care of like that. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Without any warning, Juri grabbed Yugo by his wrists and pinned him against the wall. Juri did nothing except inhale Yugo’s scent from his neck. He had moments where it became difficult to control himself. He knew that it was killing him to drink Yugo’s blood, like a cigarette, it consumed him slowly but it was so rare that Yugo came to him that he could hardly hold himself back.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>“God, why do you smell so good? I feel like fucking you right now,” Juri dirtily said in an urgent voice. </span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yugo gladly gave in as Juri grabbed him by the waist and dove his head into Yugo’s neck to lick his skin.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>When they had sex, Yugo didn’t have to talk about </span>
<em>
<span>him</span>
</em>
<span>. Even if Juri would always end up asking.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>But before that, Juri needed the touch of someone, even if it was the cold touch of a monster.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Yugo laced his legs behind Juri’s back, locking Juri’s shoulders in his arms.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<span>Tonight, they shared their messy, dirtied blood.</span>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
