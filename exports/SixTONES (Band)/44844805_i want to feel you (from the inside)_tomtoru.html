    <h2 class="toc-heading">i want to feel you (from the inside)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Shintaro sits at the end of the bar, against the wall. He takes off the stuffy suit jacket, loosens his tie and unbuttons the first few buttons of his dress shirt. He sighs deeply, he already feels so much better.</p><p>Work’s been exhausting, and it’s been taking a toll on him. He decided to go to a bar on a Friday night, he knows he deserves this.</p><p>“Long day?” the bartender asks him.</p><p>Shin chuckles at the question, “Yeah.”</p><p>He doesn’t feel like elaborating, and the bartender seemed to understand.</p><p>“Anything to get you started tonight?”</p><p>“The strongest whiskey you have, please.”</p><p>-<br/>
After a few drinks, Shintaro feels positively buzzed. He’s already forgotten what’s gotten him so stressed in the first place. He’s buzzed enough to notice the cute guy staring at him a few seats away.</p><p>Shintaro’s not stupid, and he’s not blind either. He knows the cute guy has been staring at him the entire time he’s been sitting there. Shintaro just had to be 3 whiskey glasses and 2 vodka shots down to work up the courage to walk up and say hi.</p><p>Just as he was about to stand, the bartender walks up to him and hands him another shot and says, “Taiga wanted me to give this to you.” He points to the cute dude.</p><p>Taiga, huh. Cute name for a cute guy.</p><p>Shintaro drinks the shot, feeling the alcohol burn in his chest. “Thanks, man.” He says to the bartender.</p><p>-</p><p>Shintaro finds out that Taiga’s working at one of the big corporations around Shinjuku. Some tech company or whatever, Shin doesn’t remember.</p><p>They end up making out in a dark corner of the bar, away from prying eyes. Shitaro has Taiga pinned against the wall, kissing him like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do.</p><p>“Fuck,” Shin gasps against Taiga’s lips. He can taste the drink Taiga had, something sickly sweet. Strawberry flavored.</p><p>Shin pulls away and starts kissing Taiga's neck, biting and nipping as he goes.</p><p>Taiga moans and tugs at Shin’s hair. They need to get out of here, now.</p><p>Shintaro pulls away once again. Before he even gets to say anything, he feels a pair of hands snake around his waist, and a voice whispering in his ear saying, “that’s my boyfriend you’re kissing.”</p><p>Shintaro jumps back in surprise to feel that there is, in fact, a man standing right behind him.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>“Hokuto, don’t scare him.” Taiga says, nonchalantly.</p><p>
  <i> What the fuck? </i>
</p><p>Shintaro doesn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to be branded as a cheater. What the hell is he going to do? What if people at work find out? He’s fucked.</p><p>“I’m so sorry. I didn’t know–” Shin says, panicking. He steps out from between the two men and keeps his head bowed.</p><p>“I’ll leave and we can pretend this never happened.” He says, suddenly feeling sober. This night was going so well, too.</p><p>Shintaro looks up to look at the other man, Hokuto, properly. This guy’s just as pretty as Taiga. This is one good-looking couple, Shin thinks. Shame he had come between them.</p><p>“You’re going? So soon? We haven’t even started yet.” Taiga says, disappointed.</p><p>Shintaro is properly confused.</p><p>Hokuto giggles, “Ah, you’re so cute. You look like a lost puppy.”</p><p>Shintaro’s a little pissed now.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t follow. I made out with your boyfriend, and you’re not mad?” Shintaro asks, running out of patience.</p><p>Taiga rests his head on Hokuto’s shoulder and smiles at him, “How’d you like to go home with us tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>Shintaro must be dreaming. He must be because there is no way this is happening.</p><p>“Is this real?”</p><p>Hokuto laughs, loud and genuine. “‘Is this real’ he asks!”</p><p>Taiga walks up to him and kisses him again, “Is this real enough for you?” He whispers.</p><p>Hokuto follows right behind Taiga, looks up at Shin expecting an answer. Shintaro stares at both of them. He’s never going to get this ever again.</p><p>
  <i> Fuck it. </i>
</p><p>“Alright, let’s go.”</p><p>-</p><p>They barely made it through the front door before Taiga practically threw himself onto Shin.</p><p>“You smell so good, like aftershave.” Taiga whispers against his neck.</p><p>He looks down and kisses Taiga, deep and slow. Shintaro feels Hokuto hug his waist again, kissing his cheek.</p><p>“I don’t know your name,” Hokuto whispers. “I need to know whose name I’m saying tonight.”</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, Shin thinks. These 2 will be the death of him. He doesn’t know if he’ll come out of this alive.</p><p>“Shintaro. My name.”</p><p>“Shintaro. Can I kiss you?”</p><p>Shin turns his head and kisses Hokuto. Shintaro doesn’t know what to think, is he really going to sleep with two men tonight?</p><p>Shin feels Taiga tug at his arm, “C’mon, you two.” The man urges.</p><p>They stumble into the bedroom, Taiga falling into the bed and Shin following, landing on top of him, straddling his thighs.<br/>
“What’re you going to do, Shintaro?” Hokuto asks from behind him, kissing his ears, his neck. Breath hot and heavy.</p><p>Shin usually knows what to do. He’s slept with people before, girls and boys, but for the first time, he doesn’t know what to do.</p><p>“I..I don’t know” He says honestly, albeit a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Let me help you,” Hokuto says, grabbing Shin’s hands.</p><p>Hokuto leads Shintaro’s hands onto Tagia’s body, still fully clothed, Shin allows him to lead.</p><p>“Taiga likes it when you touch him here,” Hokuto brings his hands up to Taiga’s chest, Shin squeezes, earning a gasp from the man below him.</p><p>Shin feels Hokuto smile against his skin, “See?”</p><p>Shin tries again, caressing and squeezing, Taiga squirms and gasps and pants.</p><p>“Please,” Taiga begs.</p><p>Hokuto leads Shintaro’s hands down to Taiga’s shirt. Shintaro takes it off. He stares, trying to memorize Taiga’s body, he doesn’t know if he’ll ever get a chance again.</p><p>Hokuto behind him takes his shirt off as well, and helps Shin with his dress shirt. Unbuttoning ever so slowly, taking his time with each one.</p><p>Taiga pulls Shin down and kisses him. He feels Hokuto leave from behind, so Taiga wraps his legs around Shin’s waist and grinds up, making Shin moan.</p><p>Hokuto appears again, this time beside Taiga.</p><p>“Take this off,” Hokuto orders Taiga, tugging at his pants. “You too.” He nods to Shin.</p><p>They follow wordlessly, taking their pants and underwear off.</p><p>Taiga and Shin, fully naked now, continue to make out. Shin goes down on Taiga, taking his time again, licking and kissing and nipping, mapping out his body. Taiga only squirms and moans Shin’s name.</p><p>“So pretty,” Shin says against Taiga’s stomach, making the other man shiver.</p><p>“Hokuto, please,” Taiga moans. Shin looks up and sees Hokuto biting his chest, nipples so red and hot.</p><p>Shintaro continues down, reaching Taiga’s cock. Shin wraps his hand around Taiga and strokes up and down slowly.</p><p>“Shintaro, fuck, please. Please,<i> please</i>.” Taiga begs and moans. Shin continues to stroke, hard and fast and then slow and steady. Bringing him close to the edge and pulling him back again.</p><p>“You’re a natural, Shintaro. Though, I feel a little ignored.” Hokuto chuckles from above him, petting his hair affectionately.</p><p>Shintaro responds by taking Hokuto’s pants off. He spits in his left hand and does the same, hard and fast, and then slow and steady.</p><p>Hokuto moans louder than Taiga, Shin soon discovers. He tries to stifle his moans by hiding in the crook of Taiga’s neck to no avail.</p><p>A string of swears come out from Hokuto’s mouth,</p><p>“I’m close. Shin, I’m close.” Hokuto says, breathless.</p><p>So Shintaro stops, and Hokuto groans.</p><p>“You need to stop doing that,” Hokuto says. “It’s not funny.”</p><p>Shintaro laughs, “It’s very funny. You guys are so cute.”</p><p> </p><p>Taiga huffs in response, and Hokuto ignores the statement. They really are cute, Shin thinks.</p><p>Shintaro takes Taiga in his mouth, his right hand stroking where his mouth can’t reach, his left hand on Hokuto. Shin matches the pace he goes, making sure the two men are getting enough attention.</p><p>Taiga soon tugs at Shin’s hair, “Our turn.” He says.</p><p>Shin goes up to kiss Taiga, and then Hokuto. Taiga flips them over so now Taiga is on top, Shintaro below. He looks up to Taiga, the light from the ceiling making him seem like there’s a halo around him. Maybe there was a halo there all along, Shintaro isn’t so sure.</p><p>Taiga kisses him again, deeper this time. He shoves his tongue in Shin’s mouth, tasting him all over. Bites his lip and does it again. Taiga’s kisses feel more intoxicating than the alcohol he drank at the bar.</p><p>Hokuto slowly inserts a finger into Taiga, causing him to moan into Shin’s mouth.</p><p>“Be good for me, Taiga. Be good.” Hokuto whispers, so quietly Shin almost doesn't catch it.</p><p>Hokuto continues to loosen Taiga up, to get him ready for Shin. Starting with one finger, and then two, then three. Shin tugs at his cock at the same time, matching his pace with Hokuto. When Hokuto speeds up, he does the same. When he slows down, Shin does too.  Taiga moans and begs the entire time.</p><p>“Hokuto,<i>Hokuto</i>. I’m ready.” Taiga says against Shintaro’s skin.</p><p>“He says he’s ready,” Shintaro adds. “You’ll be good. Right, Taiga?”</p><p>“<i>Yes</i>. For you. For you both, I’ll be good. Please let me–<i> let me do it</i>. Please.” Taiga begs again, close to tears from the overstimulation.</p><p>Taiga sits up and aligns himself onto Shintaro’s cock, and slowly lowers himself.</p><p>Suddenly enveloped in Taiga’s warmth, Shintaro couldn’t help but moan.</p><p>“Feels good?” Hokuto asks Taiga, who only nods in response.</p><p>Taiga continues, deeper and deeper, until Shintaro’s entire length is inside of him.</p><p>“<i>Fuck.</i>” Shintaro only says.</p><p>Taiga then moves up and slams down, causing them to moan at the same time.</p><p>Fuck.<i>Fuckfuckfuckfuck.</i></p><p>Shintaro grabs Taiga’s waist and helps him. He thrusts upwards making Taiga <i>scream</i>.</p><p>Hokuto rubs Taiga’s ignored cock, making Taiga even more overstimulated than before. Taiga can feel tears form, he’s never felt this good before.</p><p>Taiga turns his head to kiss Hokuto while Shitaro fucks Taiga senselessly.</p><p>Taiga cries and begs, alternating between <i>Hokuto</i> and <i>Shintaro</i>. Moaning, crying, begging.</p><p>Shintaro then lifts Taiga off him. Taiga groans at the sudden emptiness. He then makes Taiga go on all fours, grabs his waist and enters Taiga, fucks him doggy style.</p><p> </p><p>Hokuto positions himself right in front of Taiga’s face, and Taiga wordlessly takes Hokuto’s cock in his mouth.</p><p>Shintaro fucks him from behind, Hokuto fucks him from the mouth. Taiga feels this is all too much, but he’s never been happier in his life. To be used like this, to bask in praise and attention. He chokes on Hokuto’s cock and he fills up with Shintaro’s. Taiga is on cloud nine.</p><p>Shintaro pushes Taiga’s lower back down to fuck him deeper, he grabs Hokuto’s neck and kisses him deeply. The scent of sex fills the room, heavy and hot.</p><p>Shintaro then grabs Taiga’s arm and pulls him on his knees. He continues to fuck, hard and fast. Taiga collapses into Hokuto’s chest as Hokuto takes both of their cocks in his hand, matching the pace of Shintaro’s thrusts.</p><p>“I’m close. Fuck, Taiga. You feel so good. You’re so good.” Shintaro mumbles.</p><p>“You hear that? He said you’re good, Taiga.”</p><p>“<i>All for you.</i> Only for you.”</p><p>Taiga tightens and that’s what sends Shintaro over the edge. He comes all over Taiga’s back, panting and restless.</p><p>Hokuto and Taiga soon follow.</p><p>-</p><p>Shintaro wakes up alone in an unfamiliar bed, in a room he doesn’t recognize. He panics for a split second, but then memories of last night come crashing into him like a wave. He then feels the ache in his head and his back. Damn, they really went at it last night.</p><p>Speaking of them, where are they exactly? He remembers there being 3 people. Himself, Taiga, and Hokuto, but it’s only him in the bedroom.</p><p>He finds his clothes neatly folded on a chair in the room. He dresses himself the best he could with his wrinkled dress shirt and pants, and walks out into the apartment to find the two men in the kitchen, preparing breakfast.</p><p>Well, Hokuto was, at least. Taiga sits on one of the chairs at the kitchen aisle, while Hokuto stands over the stove, cooking something that smells amazing.</p><p>“Ah, you’re awake!” Taiga exclaims when he notices Shin.</p><p>“You wanna eat before you go? I made tamagoyaki.” Hokuto smiles at him.</p><p>These two are way different from when he met them last night. Hokuto in the dark seemed mysterious and guarded, but in the light he was the exact opposite.<br/>
Shintaro stands there in bewilderment. He really thought they’d left him alone in their apartment, or worse, they’d kick him out and never talk to him again, yet again he was proven wrong.</p><p>He sits on one of the chairs beside Taiga as Hokuto places plates in front of them. Steaming bowls of rice and tamagoyaki, accompanied by miso soup.</p><p>“You made this?” Shintaro looks at Hokuto like he’s the second coming of Christ.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you? Hokuto owns the bar we were at last night.” Taiga says.</p><p>Hokuto chuckles, “We didn’t tell him anything, Taiga. I’m Matsumura Hokuto, by the way. I don’t think we’ve formally met. In the light, anyway.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Matsumura-san.” Shintaro says, suddenly feeling shy about everything.</p><p>“Please, call me Hokuto. It feels weird for you to be so formal after last night.” Hokuto laughs.</p><p>“And you know me already,” Taiga says beside him, looking at him with his pretty brown eyes and perfect face.</p><p>“Yes. Taiga, right? That’s all I remember.”</p><p>Taiga laughs in response, “You’re so honest, Shintaro. Let me re-introduce myself, then.”</p><p>Taiga turns to face Shintaro, straightens his posture and places his hands on his lap.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, my name is Kyomoto Taiga.” He bows deeply, as if he’s meeting someone in official business.</p><p>Shintaro decides to play along,</p><p>“A pleasure to meet your acquaintance, Kyomoto-san. My name is Morimoto Shintaro. I look forward to working with you from this point on.”</p><p>Taiga laughs at Shintaro, full and bright. He’s different in the light too. It’s like meeting the same person twice.</p><p>Shintaro’s phone buzzes from inside his pants pocket, disturbing them from a peaceful morning. He opens it to discover 30 missed calls from Jesse and about 50 messages asking where he is. One of them is threatening to call the police if Shintaro doesn’t get home by 1PM, which is 30 minutes from now.</p><p>“Shit,” Shintaro exclaims. “I’m so sorry, I’d love to stay but,” He tries to explain but his words fail him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you don’t have to tell us.” Hokuto says reassuringly, “At least take the food with you.”</p><p>“Thanks, but I really have to go. My roommate…he might report me as a missing person if I don’t get home in 30 minutes.”</p><p>Taiga chuckles at the statement, “No worries, Shintaro. We’ll see you out the door.”</p><p>He’s so grateful for both of them.</p><p>Shintaro rushes to the genkan after collecting his things from Taiga and Hokuto’s apartment. Hokuto leans against the front door, and Taiga by the genkan wall.</p><p>“Shin, you’re forgetting something,” Taiga says. Shintaro looks up at him as Taiga kisses him, soft and fleeting this time.</p><p>Hokuto at the front door does the same.</p><p>“If you keep this up, I might never leave.” Shintaro says in a low voice.</p><p>“You’re welcome to come back anytime.” Hokuto replies.</p><p>-</p><p>“Where were you?” Jesse asks as soon as Shintaro was through the door.</p><p>Shintaro only smiles at him and says, “You won’t believe it.</p>
