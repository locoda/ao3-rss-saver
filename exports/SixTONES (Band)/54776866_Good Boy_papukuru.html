<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga had made the brash decision to move out of his small city apartment and found a place on the outskirts of the concrete jungle.</p><p>After years of living in the high paced city, the pressure and the exhaustion had slowly become overwhelming, crushing him as if the walls he lived within were collapsing in, ready to bury him underneath. Trapped inside rush hour trains, he couldn't breathe. Lost on bustling streets amongst blaring sounds of traffic, he couldn't think.</p><p>He couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>He had to escape.</p><p>As soon as he found a way out, he quit his job and ran. He didn't look back. He didn't think twice before accepting the new position because all he could think about was waking up with lungs full of fresh air instead of being polluted with smog. It didn't matter that it paid less. He was finally let free. He could finally stretch.</p><p>His new home was a modest one. It was nothing glamorous, but his single room studio was now a one room apartment on the ground floor. Sure, maybe the walls shook a little when neighbors slammed their doors shut, and sure, the residents upstairs loved to stomp and play loud music in the middle of the night, but none of that bothered him.</p><p>How could it bother him when the sliding glass door at the end of the living room led to a stretch of nothing but nature?</p><p>Outside was a small concrete patio only big enough for a single chair and a small side table left by the previous owner, but beyond that was all just greenery. Taiga loved how just opening the door cleansed his lungs and his heart with the crisp scent that filled his home and how it allowed in the serenade of ruffling leaves in the wind and cicadas singing at night.</p><p>It was wonderful. He didn't regret a single second. Everything was almost exactly as he had imagined.</p><p>He just hadn't envisioned that his welcoming party would be a small animal out his back door.</p><p>It was only three weeks after he had moved in. It was a late and peacefully quiet evening when it happened. Taiga was already well into preparing his dinner when the scratching sounded through the glass. He was aware of the who or what that could emerge outside of his home from the woods and though he was comforted by the tight door lock and thick curtains that kept the outside <em> outside</em>, his heart nearly leapt from his chest.</p><p>He clutched his hand over his heart, holding it within his body as he took a deep breath and kept his eyes on the curtain-covered door while he quickly shut off the stove and TV, bringing his home into silence. He wanted to make sure he actually heard what he thought came from outside and it wasn't something just manufactured from the blending of noises and his imagination. And if it was real, he hoped it would, at least, just go away.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>But the scratching happened again.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Perhaps a smarter person would have chosen to stay silent until whatever it was went away, or better yet, just ignored it. It was better to approach these kinds of things with hesitancy rather than risk the potential consequences of improper action, but Taiga wasn't exactly known for making calculated moves. He was a “action first, think later” type person, and his curiosities surpassed his fears.</p><p>Before approaching the curtains slowly, he armed himself with the sturdiest of his kitchenware, a ladle, and began to slowly pull the fabric back.</p><p>He just wanted a peek. He just wanted to see enough to know whether everything was fine or if he needed to rush to lock himself within his bedroom and call the police. All he needed was enough to see what to do, but once he finally pushed back the curtains to see outside, all he saw were the evening sky and the quiet trees sleeping below it.</p><p>So.</p><p>At least there was no murderer out to get him.</p><p>Yet, the scratching sounded again.</p><p>This time, Taiga looked lower.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What the— Why–?...”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What looked back at him was a puppy.</p><p>It couldn't have been any more than a few months old from the way it stumbled and tripped on its own uncoordinated feet as Taiga opened the door after tossing the ladle onto the couch. As he squatted down, it reared back, unsure of whether to approach or run. It whined with its head lowered as Taiga slowly held out the back of his hand.</p><p>“Hey… Are you lost?”</p><p>If it hadn't been for the red collar around its neck, Taiga would have never been able to spot it with its jet black fur disguised in the night. It was clear it was cautious and weary as it took hesitant trotting steps forward and back, reaching out and jolting away, while Taiga waited patiently with his hand out.</p><p>“It's okay… I won't hurt you…”</p><p>It took a few more rotations of the puppy’s strange dance before it finally built enough courage to come closer, ears lowered and tail between its legs. Slowly, it reached forward, touching its cold nose against Taiga’s knuckles as it sniffed before almost immediately beginning to lick at his hand.</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but laugh a little. The sensation was wet and leathery as it licked at the ends of his fingers before quickly covering the inside of his hand as soon as Taiga turned it to offer his palm.</p><p>“You must smell my dinner…” he said softly, watching its pink tongue flick past and between his fingers.</p><p>This could only have been the reason for the puppy’s arrival. The apartment building wasn't exactly new and despite using ventilation, enough of his food’s scent could have leaked through the aging cracks to attract the keen sense of smell of a young canine. Which all meant one thing.</p><p>“Are you hungry?...”</p><p>Taiga could only imagine it's stomach was empty of it was desperate to eagerly lap up what taste there was up and around his thumb, though it wasn't as if it was starving. The puppy was still a little round from its baby weight and energetic as well as had a clean coat and a new collar. It hadn't been abandoned, but maybe just missed a meal. And a meal, Taiga could provide.</p><p>Against his better judgment, Taiga took a step back inside and let the puppy in, standing back as if it were some honorable guests while it warely peaked its snout inside.</p><p>It didn't immediately enter. Smart. Its owner must have taught it well in the same way a parent told their children to not trust strangers. Even as Taiga made his way back to the kitchen, it didn't follow, only peering through the small opening in the door he left for it, but all the hesitation was dashed away the moment his fork chimed off the porcelain plate as he tore a small bit of his dinner into small pieces.</p><p>It was like the puppy already knew the place as it dashed in, immediately jumping up and pawing at him with his forelegs, begging and whining for food.</p><p>“Here you go. Don't eat too fast, okay?”</p><p>Of course, the puppy was just as cute while it scarfed down its food.</p><p>It adorably ate as if it hadn't been fed in days while Taiga took advantage of the distraction to turn and read the letters engraved on the silver tag. Unfortunately, it didn't bear an address or a number. But it did have a name.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Pochi.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Well. That was a pretty simple name.</p><p>He would never shame anyone for what they decided to call their pets, anyone was allowed to name them whatever they wanted, but that didn't mean Taiga didn't pass a little bit of silent judgment. It was sort of a lazy name, but he couldn't deny it was a popular name for a reason. It was cute because and despite its simplicity.</p><p>“Pochi~” Taiga called in a sweet voice.</p><p>It was the same voice he used at his parent's house with his childhood dog. Anzu would always come scuttling over to him when he used this tone that it became a habit for any encounter with a small cute animal.</p><p>“How is it?... Is it yummy?” he asked, sitting down on the floor beside it.</p><p>The plain pan-cooked chicken Taiga had prepared for it was completely gone by the time he began to scratch Pochi’s back. The itching made it wiggle and squirm as it licked its lips.</p><p>“Is your belly full? Are you happy?”</p><p>Apparently he (which Taiga could now see was a <em> he</em>) wasn't a fan of the scratches on his back. He rolled over, seemingly nudging Taiga’s hand away with his snout while twirling around it. But Taiga didn't stop, letting the puppy have his hand to paw and nip at his fingers while he itched him in new places.</p><p>He knew there had to be a spot. All dogs had one. It wasn't on the belly and it wasn't on its hind legs. It wasn't on its side and—... Ah. There it was.</p><p>The moment Taiga began to itch under his chin, his wiggling and pawing stopped, completely melting into his touch.</p><p>Taiga smiled when Pochi leaned into his hand.</p><p>“Is this where you like it?” he asked.</p><p>He could only assume the answer was yes as he watched how Pochi’s eyes slowly fell closed with a happy bliss.</p><p>Taiga went on, exploiting the weak spot, scratching along his muzzle and catching the areas under his collar he couldn't reach as Pochi stretched out his neck, asking for more. If it had gone on any longer, Taiga would have expected for Pochi to drift off to sleep just like that in his hands. Taiga wouldn't have minded either. It was so cute as he went limp under his touch. But something made him perk up, his ears raised at attention before he ran back to the sliding door where he came in.</p><p>He nearly tripped on the pooling of the curtain fabric as Taiga followed after, unlocking the latch.</p><p>“You want out?”</p><p>Pochi replied by scratching against the window.</p><p>Dogs had the ability to hear things humans couldn't. Taiga never doubted that fact, especially now as all there was outside were the same ol’ trees and the evenings’ quiet, but Pochi continued to paw at the glass, now from the inside. Taiga had anticipated keeping Pochi with him overnight to seek out his owner tomorrow, but oftentimes, dogs knew better than they did, even when still so young.</p><p>It was instinct, after all.</p><p>Taiga gave Pochi one last scratch on the head before pushing the door open, his snout already squeezing out the exit before it was wide enough to squish his whole small body through.</p><p>“Stay safe, okay? Don't get lost again” was all Taiga was able to say before, just like that, Pochi disappeared into the night.</p><p>As he closed and locked the door, pulling the curtains back over it, Taiga let out a light sigh with a small smile.</p><p>That would be the first and last time he would see Pochi.</p><p>If the same thing had happened with him and Anzu when she was that young, Taiga would have never left a door or a gate open around her ever again, no less keep his eyes off of her for more than a second when outside. He couldn't imagine how worried sick he would have been or what Pochi’s owner must have been feeling until Pochi returned home. If he and Pochi’s owner were anything alike, the little pup would never make a great escape again.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>… Or so that's what Taiga had thought.</p><p>Two weeks later, Pochi arrived at his back door again.</p><p>Then the week next.</p><p>Then only a couple days after.</p><p>Pochi made himself a guest at Taiga’s home on his own irregular schedule for the next following months, again, still well fed and spotless. His home couldn't have been far as Pochi somehow always found his way to his door, but it let Taiga pet and feed him guilt free, knowing that the small puppy would always return to shelter after he trotted away satisfied.</p><p>Though, Pochi wasn't exactly small anymore.</p><p>As all dogs did, Pochi had grown at an almost alarming rate.</p><p>By all means, Pochi was still a puppy, it was just that his miniature figure had lengthened and stretched into its new slender build with his equally uncoordinated limbs as his stays in Taiga’s homes lengthened as well. In the beginning, he only ever stayed long enough for a snack and some scratches, but as they grew closer, he began to play.</p><p>Pochi would flail around with his new found body, choosing Taiga’s hands and arms as his chosen opponents, play-biting at his fingers and kicking at his grip while Taiga easily pushed and rolled him into his back, tickling his sides. And while the roughhousing left scratches and bruises on Taiga’s skin, it was all worth it when the tired out Pochi took his place in his new favorite spot, curled up in the folds of Taiga’s lap as Taiga spoiled him sick with his beloved itches under the chin and rubs under his bright red collar.</p><p>The nights Pochi came over were peaceful. With the TV volume turned low, Taiga let Pochi sleep on his lap for however long the puppy wanted because in the end, it allowed Taiga to stroke his soft black fur while relaxing with his warmth. The loose waves and curls that had grown in Pochi’s velvety coat was almost like therapy as Taiga pet him gently, feeling the delicate steady rise and fall of the puppy's body as he slept. It reminded him of the many times he watched Anzu fall asleep on his chest. She was the only thing he regretted leaving behind when he moved out of the city.</p><p>Anzu had been with him ever since he was a teenager and was comforted by her quiet subtle sounds and her familiar weight in his arms as he came home to her every day. She was much smaller and much calmer than Pochi, but the companionship of a dog was all the same.</p><p>It was because of Anzu, Taiga knew how to handle Pochi so well, but it was also because of Anzu, Taiga knew just how big Pochi would get.</p><p>Pochi was already the size of Anzu at a few months old and he was still growing.</p><p>Soon enough, Pochi would be big enough to knock him off his feet with some effort, but it didn't really matter.</p><p>If Pochi scratched at his door, Taiga would let him in.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>“A dating sim?”</p><p>Yugo nodded, taking the vacant chair of Taiga’s cube neighbor to sit next to him.</p><p>“Yeah. Plain and simple.”</p><p>Kochi Yugo was an old college friend. They had lost contact for the most part after graduation, but Yugo had messaged him at the peak of Taiga’s desperation to give him a job offer at his small game development company like a divine message from God. He also helped him find his current apartment. Taiga really couldn't be thankful enough. Taiga wasn't even sure if he would have ever landed the job had Yugo not been the office manager for the application branch. He had done some background work for small independent games and covers for light novels, but without Yugo’s good word, he wasn't really sure if he could say that his resume had enough weight.</p><p>As far as work went, Taiga’s assignments had mostly consisted of assistant work and final rendering of assets. But seemingly, Yugo was seeking a bit of a fresher perspective for the new project.</p><p>Taiga flipped through the slides Yugo sent him of the game proposal on his computer.</p><p>Just as Yugo had said, it appeared pretty ‘plain and simple.’</p><p>“Six characters, six romances, six scenarios. I'm only asking you to do the concept art since you're still pretty new here, but if the director likes your work, we might hire you to do the official illustrations.”</p><p>Taiga squinted at the screen. “What's the time line?... I have some other work I have to complete by the middle of next month.”</p><p>“Four weeks.”</p><p>“Four weeks isn't a lot…”</p><p>“It's just conceptual. Just a sketch or an idea should be enough. One character shouldn't take the whole week. I'm sure you can do it.”</p><p>Along with his other work, getting six sketches done in four weeks wasn't exactly easy, but Yugo’s experience in the field made it hard to argue with him. It wasn't impossible, but it wasn't a relaxed timeline either. Accepting this meant he was committing himself to late nights in the office and overtime, but it was hard to turn down a rare opportunity with a potential of promotion.</p><p>Taiga pressed his lips into a flat line as he conceded, already feeling the exhaustion sinking into his frame. “Alright. Sure. I'll see what I can do.”</p><p>His tablet pen fumbled from his hand when Yugo squeezed his arm enthusiastically and stood up from the stolen seat. “Great! I think you’ll do a great job, Taiga!”</p><p>“Yeah thanks… but I just have one more question.”</p><p>Yugo looked back over to see Taiga’s finger pointing at his screen.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“... What's this?”</p><p>“Oh, you don't know?” Yugo laughed.</p><p>“This kind of thing is really popular in the market right now.”</p><p>No.</p><p>Taiga didn't know.</p><p>But he quickly learned.</p><p>This kind of <em> thing </em> Yugo was referring to was the recent trend of theming characters around other objects or animals and indeed, it was popular.</p><p>It was all over the place. Games had girls as race horses and warships and had historical swords as men. They had expanded into animes and merchandise while other companies quickly went to follow in the footsteps of the growing genre and the expanse of it all made Taiga's head hurt. It was confusing as it was enamoring as he tried to study the subject matter for some inspiration. He quickly got sucked into an internet knowledge hole he never thought he would find himself getting stuck in, but once he finally dug himself out to breathe, he was glad his assignment was only dogs.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Dogs.</p><p>You know the ones. The domesticated canines that people kept in their homes.</p><p>The slide Taiga had pointed to on his computer monitor had photos of six different breeds of dogs displayed upon it, and now Taiga was tasked to make them into humans.</p><p>He let out a long breath, closing his laptop before slowly sinking further underneath his kotatsu he barely managed to fit in the living area of his home as he stared at the small screen of his TV. His glasses reflected back the commercial of some cute cartoon boys he didn't recognize as he watched it with a blank gaze.</p><p>The task seemed simple, but sometimes the more simple the task was, the harder it was to make it something interesting.</p><p>What were women from the age of twenty to thirty even into nowadays?...</p><p>Attractive qualities were just as circular as fashion and trends and Taiga didn't exactly have his thumb on the pulse of the female populace to really know what was in the current tastes. Sure, Taiga was also attracted to men on occasion, but even what a bi-curious male was into didn't always line up with the general heterosexual woman's opinion.</p><p>He could remember one of the dogs on the slide was a typical golden retriever, but what would a golden retriever look like as a man?</p><p>Taiga set down his mug of tea to trade it for the notepad and pencil he liked to keep around for whenever an idea came.</p><p>He roughly sketched out a tall figure with a head of wavy hair… but what else after that?...</p><p>Gold hair?... A big smile?... A clean western face?...</p><p>Taiga erased soft lines before drawing them in again.</p><p>He wasn't sure, but he sure as hell didn't want whatever he made to be boring. His pencil rolled between his fingers as he closed his eyes to think, but the warmth radiating from under the kotatsu was muddling his focus with a comfortable drowsiness. The chill in the room from the poor insulation didn't exactly do any favors either as it made Taiga feel more snug while pulling the cover further up his chest.</p><p>Eventually, the notepad and pencil fell from his hands as Taiga drifted to sleep.</p><p>He wasn't sure how much time had passed when he finally woke up to a noise against the back door.</p><p>It sounded much like Pochi’s heavy paw resonating off the glass, so Taiga didn't pay much mind when he stood up, rubbing his blurry eyes before pulling back the blinds and unlocking the door.</p><p>It was just the beginning of early winter. Pochi must have been cold. The last few times he came in, he quickly curled under the kotatsu and Taiga believed today to be no different.</p><p>He pushed the heavy door open with a yawn before rubbing at his arms with a shiver.</p><p>“Pochi~” he said, in his usual sweet voice.</p><p>“It's cold, so come on and—...”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Oh.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga had expected to feel the dog push past his legs before he even got the door opened wide enough for him to come inside or even the sound of his collar jingling as he shook out his dark coat.</p><p>But today, the opening of his door was only greeted with an unusual silence.</p><p>He wasn't really sure what he was seeing. It felt like his eyes were playing tricks on him, but the night wasn't dark enough to keep his living room lights from clearly illuminating what he saw before him.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It was a man.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Not even a boy.</p><p>But a man.</p><p>Taiga touched the side of his glasses to ensure he actually had them on.</p><p>The man had a mess of dark hair that obscured his eyes as he looked up at him from the ground on all fours. He was thinly dressed, only wearing a simple T-shirt and a pair of sweats, an outfit reasonable for staying only inside.</p><p>… Along with a familiar red collar around his neck with the same silver tag.</p><p>Taiga’s mouth opened wordlessly as he stared at the man in front of him.</p><p>He felt like an idiot before he even said it, but it wasn't enough to keep the words from forming on his tongue.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“P-... Pochi?...”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What Taiga was implying by calling the dog’s name was absurd. It was stupid to even consider that <em> this</em>, out of all life’s options, would be what was before him, but Taiga couldn't deny the look of recognition that flashed in the man’s eyes when he said the puppy’s name and the striking resemblance he bore of the dog that visited him only days before.</p><p>Aside from the collar, his lengthy shag of jet black hair matched the dark silky coat of the dog. Even the innocent hesitation he showed as Taiga squatted down to reach him reminded him of Pochi as he saw the pronounced canines in his teeth as he quietly gasped.</p><p>This was a dream.</p><p>This had to be a dream.</p><p>It could have only been a <em> dream</em>, right?</p><p>This was just like one of those storylines from one of those dating sims.</p><p>All the talks and studies about men and women becoming objects and animals and animals and objects becoming men and women must have infected his subconscious and leaked into his dreams. As a result, it manufactured this scenario before him that was ripped straight from a game where the player character encounters the human form of the alley cat they had fed the night before.</p><p>This was all a dream.</p><p>But it didn't change how the cocktail of adrenaline and drowsiness made Taiga act on his impulse.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>"... I-... I won't hurt you…"</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Just as he had done with the small puppy before, Taiga offered his hand as he spoke in a gentle voice.</p><p>He fought to keep his hand from shaking, but the man– the dog–... the<em> whoever </em>it was before him was just as hesitant as he flinched from his hand as it grew closer. Taiga couldn't blame him. This must have been just as confusing for him as it was for himself.</p><p>But the man didn't retreat, either.</p><p>After a beat, he almost appeared to lean in, even as Taiga turned over his hand and brushed his fingers over cheek.</p><p>This was stupid.</p><p>This was insane.</p><p>This was all so crazy that it couldn't have been real.</p><p>Yet, the man’s skin felt so soft and so warm, feeling as real as any human could ever be.</p><p>Taiga didn't understand.</p><p>But he didn't stop either.</p><p>As he watched the eyes that bore back into his own, he grazed his fingers over the edge of the man’s jaw and as the man stayed still, Taiga cautiously brushed his knuckles under his chin.</p><p>If there was one thing Taiga knew about Pochi, he knew that Pochi loved his pets and itches under his muzzle. The puppy would squirm and wiggle around in excitement when Taiga itched him in his favorite place before nudging his hand with his nose for more. Was it crazy to assume that the dark haired man could enjoy the same sensation? Maybe, but at this point, what about this situation wasn't?</p><p>And Taiga had to test his theory.</p><p>His fingers smoothed along the bottom of his jawline, curling, to nudge the curve of his knuckles gently against the soft skin. They moved back and forth in a slow easy itching movement, following the line of his chin.</p><p>Taiga watched him carefully for a response. And at first, there was nothing but maybe some confusion in his gaze.</p><p>But as his thumb brushed against the side of his jaw, his eyes began to slowly drift closed.</p><p>He even seemed to lean into it, raising his chin to present Taiga with more of his neck.</p><p>Taiga had to cover his mouth with his hand to keep himself from smiling.</p><p>Jeez.</p><p>Was it okay to find this so endearing?...</p><p>He ran the back of his fingers along the top of his throat, softly rubbing against it before returning up to where it met his chin and around the hook of his jaw.</p><p>“Does it feel good?...” Taiga asked quietly.</p><p>The man didn't respond as he tilted his head, letting Taiga run his nails gently down his neck and under his chin, the familiar sound of the metal tag of his collar chiming against its hook with the rhythmic movements.</p><p>It didn't make sense. Taiga <em> knew </em> it didn't make sense, but didn't know how else to explain it.</p><p>This man was Pochi.</p><p>No matter what angle he looked at it from, the person before him not only looked like Pochi, but behaved like him down to the way he gradually let the weight of his head rest in Taiga’s hand.</p><p>It wasn't really <em> that </em> impossible, was it? Surely, stranger things have happened.</p><p>Right?...</p><p>And if this was all just a dream or some elaborate prank, what harm was there in entertaining it for a bit longer?</p><p>After all, behind all the shaggy hair was a face that was cute as the puppy was.</p><p>That, in itself, was enough to convince Taiga to invite him inside.</p><p>“A-are you hungry?...”</p><p>Pochi – the <em> man </em>– didn't reply, but when he stood as Taiga did, Taiga found himself nearly stumbling back once seeing him at his full height. As he caught himself against the door, he gave a nervous chuckle, taking the handle that had jammed into his back to push it open.</p><p>“Woah– Man, you're tall— I hadn't expected you to be so big…”</p><p>Pochi – the <em> dog </em> – had grown larger over the last few months but Taiga hadn't expected it to reflect this much in the man’s size. It wasn't that Taiga was all that small and Pochi was that much bigger, he was just used to a puppy that liked to weave himself between his legs. But, the comment didn't seem to bother Pochi as he closely followed Taiga’s footsteps backwards into his home, allowing Taiga to see him in his entirety.</p><p>Taiga rubbed his eyes under his glasses.</p><p>He wasn't sure how much closer all of this could be to those dating simulations.</p><p>From all the samples and studies Taiga did, Pochi might as well have been an A-typical model of the boys in those games, down to the simple clothing, good looks, lack of words, and his bare feet that somehow made him look charmingly innocent.</p><p>And like all those games, Taiga could only expect that Pochi would have a taste for something more than the usual bland chicken he served him.</p><p>“Um…” Taiga motioned to the kotatsu for him to sit while he stepped into the kitchen. “I-is curry okay?...”</p><p>The other was looking back and forth around the room while slipping himself slowly into the blanketed warmth before Taiga suddenly called to him, grabbing his notice.</p><p>It was cute how he seemed to perk up in his seat, like a dog with his ears standing up at attention as he nodded hesitantly.</p><p>Taiga sighed as he scooped the curry into a bowl with a hefty serving of rice.</p><p>Did he really just think this big man was cute?</p><p>It would be something he would have to reconcile with himself later.</p><p>Maybe he had been single for just a little too long…</p><p>The plate rang softly off of the wooden table as Taiga placed it before Pochi.</p><p>“Eat slowly, okay?”</p><p>Taiga cringed at his own words as he set down a spoon next to the meal.</p><p>It was a force of habit. He had grown used to asking Pochi to pace his own eating as the puppy had the bad habit of inhaling his food, but it felt odd saying the same to a full sized man. He wasn't really sure how Pochi’s mannerisms would translate to using a spoon, but Taiga was pleasantly surprised as his guest nodded obediently before taking his utensil to dig in.</p><p>How well behaved…</p><p>“Would you like water?”</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>“Alright. Let me get that for you.”</p><p>After bringing him a glass, Taiga sat down under the kotatsu with him and simply watched him eat.</p><p>He had seen how Pochi – the dog – scarfed down his food many times, but this was just a <em> little </em> different considering that the Pochi sitting adjacent to him actually had functional thumbs.</p><p>He ate properly. He took large scoops of the food and fed them into his mouth before leaving the silverware clean as it came from his lips. He chewed with an excited hunger, much like the puppy Taiga knew, but ate at an even pace as if to savor it.</p><p>And with each bite, Taiga’s eyes caught on the prominent canines in his teeth he had only seen a flash of before.</p><p>They were certainly human, but perhaps it was due to his transformation that they seemed to catch glints of light as he ate. They were cute though, a nearly cliche retention of an animal-like feature that stayed in his form. Otherwise, all the rest of him was just like a regular human man.</p><p>Taiga propped his chin up on his palm as he watched him take another bite.</p><p>… A handsome one, at that.</p><p>With the messy black hair and the veil of night, his features were hidden, but now under the living room lights, Taiga could see every detail.</p><p>He had sharp eyes and a sculpted jaw that formed a flawlessly attractive face that could have easily been the result of a woman’s image of an ideal man. His lips even had a perfect imperfection with the small beauty mark placed at just the upper corner to make him starkly unique from other pretty faces.</p><p>Taiga didn't think it was possible for him to ever be so enamored in a man’s looks, but here he was, studying him like an art piece.</p><p>He was so lost in every fine detail, to the angle of his lips and the tensing of his jaw as he chewed, that he hadn't noticed how he reached out to tuck the black waves of his hair behind his ear.</p><p>“Ah–”</p><p>Taiga’s hand jolted back when Pochi flinched away from his touch.</p><p>“Oh, I'm sorry, I just–...”</p><p>Taiga stammered as he tried to explain, though he didn't really have any words for his reasoning.</p><p>He just felt the need to apologize after watching the way his carelessness had shocked Pochi enough to drop and abandon his spoon in favor of clasping his hand over his ear, and honestly, Taiga should have known.</p><p>As a puppy, Pochi was also hesitant to let him pet any other places aside from his chin at first. He would pull back, reeling away from his hand even after eating all the food Taiga took the time to personally prepare for him, but over time, Pochi started to come back, lowering his head to allow Taiga to itch behind his ear and along his snout. It took several weeks and payments of food to finally develop that trust so he shouldn't have been surprised.</p><p>This was still Pochi, after all, and all that was happening today must have been overwhelming.</p><p>… But all at the same time, Pochi was indeed the same Pochi Taiga had spent all that time with before. And after his shocked gaze softened, it lowered back down to his half finished food as he picked up his spoon again and straightened his back in his seat. He went on and ate as if nothing had happened.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And just like the puppy, he gently bowed his head as if to encourage Taiga’s touch.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Once again, Taiga had to cover his mouth to keep himself from smiling.</p><p>It was becoming harder and harder to not find him adorable.</p><p>When Taiga reached out once more, Pochi didn't move away. He let him slowly brush his fingers through his hair, revealing the shape of his eyebrows before his hand pushed through his locks, smoothing them back and away from his face to let him eat with more ease. He ate as if Taiga wasn't playing with his hair at all as the other combed back his bangs, only exposing more of his good looks before Taiga let them gently fall back over his brow.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... Good boy…”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>While Taiga didn't notice the tightening of his hand on his spoon, it was hard to not see the peachy color that was blooming over Pochi’s face when Taiga was still indulging himself with his hair.</p><p>It only made Taiga’s own cheeks tint a pink color once realizing what exactly left his lips.</p><p>“Oh– I— uh-”</p><p>Before he could apologize, the spoon clattering in the empty plate interrupted him as Pochi pushed it towards him, much like how the puppy did when he nudged the plate with his nose to ask for more food.</p><p>Taiga's hand was still raised, just a brush away from Pochi’s black locks when he looked down to see the quiet request for another serving.</p><p>“... More?...” he asked.</p><p>Pochi nodded.</p><p>Taiga couldn't help but feel a little bad after Pochi’s cheeks burned brighter when he let out a short breath of a laugh. It was just so endearing, he couldn't hold it in.</p><p>He apologized as he stood up, taking the plate with him. “I'm sorry, don't worry. I'll get you some more, okay?”</p><p>As he passed behind him, he couldn't resist leaving Pochi without ruffling his hair. It put a smile on his face as he went to the kitchen to spoon more of his own dinner for his guest to eat, putting him in the perfect place to secretly watch Pochi through the small pass-through.</p><p>Pochi was just waiting patiently by himself, fixing the disarray Taiga put in his hair with his still cheeks rosy while he covered his face behind his bangs again. It was a shame that he hid himself behind the curtain of his hair again, but Taiga didn't mind in the end.</p><p>Especially since it allowed him to see how Pochi tucked his hair behind his ear, as if to mimic the same touch he had given him before.</p><p>Taiga bit at the inside of his lip as he watched Pochi quickly ruffled his hair, ruining the tuck.</p><p>Cute.</p><p>He closed the lid of his rice cooker after adding just a little more to the second serving.</p><p>“Here you go.”</p><p>Before Taiga sat, he took the TV remote to turn on something to keep his eyes busy and to give the man, with his new found form, some privacy with his meal.</p><p>In the later hours of the evening, there wasn't all that much on air aside from some late night dramas Taiga took little interest in and various talk shows with celebrities he didn't recognize, but despite tonight being strange, the night was falling into a familiar pattern.</p><p>With the TV softly playing and with the food finished, there was a comfortable lull in the pace of the room. It was peacefully relaxed as it often was at this time of night, drawing its patrons to drowsy embrace and Pochi was no exception, as a puppy or as a man. With a full stomach and a warm from the kotatsu, Pochi’s eyes started to blink with an undeniable sleepiness after his second plate of food was clean.</p><p>Pochi didn't look the way he did before, but he was so much of the same puppy he was. Over the whole span of the night, he proved himself over and over how they were very much one in the same. He was Pochi. Just like in all those ridiculous games, he was both.</p><p>So then, he would certainly like to have his favorite spot.</p><p>“Do… Do you want to lay down?...”</p><p>Taiga hadn't exactly had much intimacy with men. It made him hesitant of his offer, but if he was a dog, it was fine. Well– right <em> now</em>, Pochi wasn't a dog of course. He was a man. But he was the same being who loved to curl up in his lap and it was already too late to take the words back.</p><p>Though, as Pochi looked at him with a confused gaze, rubbing his tired eyes, Taiga started to doubt if he had made the right choice.</p><p>If this was a dating sim like this wild dream was making it to be, it felt he had selected the riskiest dialogue choice. Games like this provided different response options and while most would pick the more careful conservative line as to not disrupt the delicate relationship they were building, Taiga believed he had picked the one with high risks in hopes of great rewards, resulting in disapproval.</p><p>He was ready to laugh it all off and pretend it was a joke in hopes of reducing the amount of damage he had done to their rapport and his own ego.</p><p>It was fine. People made mistakes sometimes and he had just made a bad call.</p><p>"Or you don't have to! It's okay, you can just–...”</p><p>But before he could finish his sentence, Pochi leaned towards him.</p><p>Taiga watched him, his words drifting off as Pochi’s hand placed down in the space between them with heavy eyes.</p><p>Hesitantly, Taiga moved back the kotatsu cover from his waist.</p><p>He patted his lap gently with his hand, just as he did with the puppy many times before, his eyes following the man’s fluttering weighted lashes while he grew closer.</p><p>“Come on…” Taiga said softly.</p><p>“You can rest your head here…”</p><p>… He had to be Pochi.</p><p>He had to be.</p><p>Otherwise his head couldn't have felt so natural placed upon his lap.</p><p>Once Taiga pulled the skirt back over them, he didn't take another moment before he began to draw his fingers gently through the locks of Pochi’s black hair.</p><p>“Does it feel good?...”</p><p>Pochi didn't respond with anything except the small nuzzling of his nose into Taiga’s clothes.</p><p>His eyes were closed as Taiga played with the soft curls and waves in his hair, letting them wind and play around his fingers before he ran his nails slowly along his scalp to move them away from his face, watching the curls fall back into place.</p><p>His hair was soft and smooth just like the puppy’s fur. Of course, a dog’s coat was a bit rougher, but as a man, it was simply a pleasure to touch.</p><p>The TV was left on, unwatched, as Taiga followed his hair down to the collar that remained around his neck. Even though Pochi squirmed for a moment when he brushed his fingers along his nape, untucking his hair from under the red band, he relaxed again as Taiga ran his nails up and along through his hair from the back of his neck, tugging at it gently to see the true length of his locks.</p><p>… He was so cute…</p><p>He seemed to melt under his touch even when Taiga was selfishly playing with his hair. And his profile was just as handsome as it was from the front.</p><p>His ears had a cute round shape and his nose was sharp in a way that looked unreasonably perfect. Also from the side, he could more easily see how crafted and sharp his jaw truly was as he relaxed into him.</p><p>And his lips.</p><p>How many girls would love to have a chance to kiss those lips if he was a character in a game?</p><p>Taiga combed his hair behind his ear, just as he did before, but not without running his fingers carefully around the back of its shell.</p><p>Would this be the route he would have picked himself?</p><p>Taiga laughed quietly to himself, brushing his fingers through the soft fade beside his ear.</p><p>“I guess… I guess if it was someone like you…”</p><p>Taiga whispered, watching the slow steady breaths that softly left the man’s gently parted lips.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“If it was someone like you… I wouldn't mind having you as a boyfriend…”</p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Taiga woke up with a jolt.</p><p>He gasped sharply before yelping and cursing loudly after banging his knee against the bottom of the kotatsu. Tears stung his eyes from the pain as he rubbed his bruise, the tingle from hitting his funny bone still sending sparks up and down his leg.</p><p>He wasn't in his bed. Obviously.</p><p>The purple color that would bloom over his kneecap was evidence of that.</p><p>The heat from the kotatsu must have lulled him to sleep. It was something that happened often, though not usually until morning which he could tell it now was even with the curtains drawn from the sound of birds chirping outside his windows.</p><p>The TV was still on. It was playing some talk show with the host speaking with a cheery tone suited for the morning as Taiga looked around, finding the room exactly as he left it when he fell asleep.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Aside from the pencil and notepad that were left discarded beside him on the floor with a half finished drawing, he was alone.</p><p>Taiga fixed his glasses on his nose.</p><p>“... So it was a dream.”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>All of it was simply a dream.</p><p>He got up with a sigh, rubbing his face and grabbing his mug to pour out the tea that had long gone cold before he stripped off his clothes to make up for the shower he didn't take the night before.</p><p>Of course, it was all a dream.</p><p>The stress and the pressure must have gotten to his head and created a story and a man that was only possible in fiction. The whole thing was much too crazy to be real and the man was much too handsome to be human. Dreams were simply strange in that way.</p><p>He let the water blast his face as he stood directly under it, letting the pressure punish him for crafting up something so foolish.</p><p>Despite how confusing it was, he could use it as inspiration. While none of it actually happened, now he knew his brain was capable of crafting someone that would fit perfectly for his work's story, at least. Yes, it made him question his relationship status and reconsider his own tastes, but his mind’s overactivity from the night gave him ideas for his designs.</p><p>After changing into clothes he would stay inside with for the day, he ruffled his damp hair with his towel, muttering to himself in his empty home.</p><p>“God, I'm so single…”</p><p>Taiga wasn't sure if he had ever been so thankful for a delivery as a knock on his door let him brush the musings of his extended single life aside.</p><p>It must have been a package. There weren't many other reasons for someone to be knocking on his door since he hadn't exactly told many people his new address. Unless it was a neighbor coming over to complain about him leaving his TV on all night, that's all it could be. When Taiga opened the door, he preemptively looked down, expecting a clipboard to be pushed into his hands for a signature.</p><p>He really didn't expect to see Pochi.</p><p>The dog.</p><p>With his red collar around his neck.</p><p>With a leash attached to the clip.</p><p>And when Taiga looked up, somehow much more awake than after his morning shower, he found Pochi.</p><p>The man.</p><p>Though this time, he wore thick round glasses on his nose while dressed in a strange but charming outfit Taiga could never find himself imagining.</p><p>If sleeping at the kotatsu overnight hadn't already made his head ache, it certainly hurt now.</p><p>“Uh–... U-Um…” Taiga tripped over his words, once finally bringing himself back to earth enough to make his voice work.</p><p>“G-good morning—?”</p><p>Pochi was panting, pulling at his leash to excitedly lick and nudge at Taiga’s hand, getting him to scratch his head though Taiga’s eyes never left the man’s in front of him.</p><p>“Umm…” the man said quietly as he lowered his head.</p><p>“Good morning…”</p><p>It was only after he spoke that Taiga realized he hadn't heard what his voice sounded like before. It was gentle and low as he talked softly, standing like a statue before him with his dog pulling at his wrist.</p><p>While his voice was as charming as his face, Taiga couldn't do anything but stare at him with no words to say.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What was happening?...</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What was going on??</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What did this all mean?????????</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Who was this?? Who was the person last night??? Was this all a coincidence or was this all just another dream in replay????</p><p>What the hell <b> <em>happened</em></b>?????</p><p>He didn't understand anything as he was rendered completely speechless. While he may have looked normal on the outside, his brain was overloading, trying to process what exactly was before him.</p><p>Taiga grasped the handle of his front door to keep his head from spinning more than it already was as he fought to bring himself to say <em> something </em> before it got any more uncomfortable. “Uh, I-I—”</p><p>“I'm so <em> so </em>sorry.”</p><p>Taiga blinked, shutting his mouth as the man abruptly bowed his head low enough for Pochi to lick at his nose.</p><p>“Uh— Let me introduce myself first” he said with his face still towards their feet.</p><p>“I-I'm Matsumura Hokuto…”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto explained everything.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Hokuto wasn't sure how it all ended up like this, but he knew this was exactly the reason why he usually didn't drink.</p><p>Jesse and Juri were rowdy as they had ever been. They came over to his apartment, already tipsy on drinks along with the insistence that Hokuto joined in their debauchery with them.</p><p>Hokuto had always been someone who had a hard time saying no, but saying no to people like Juri and Jesse was even harder, and after doing the simple math, it all summed up to Hokuto getting drunk along with them.</p><p>It didn't take many drinks for him to feel sick. His head was already spinning and pounding with the sounds of Jesse’s loud laughter from Pochi licking at his face as he rolled around on the floor while playing with him.</p><p>Juri shook Hokuto’s shoulder. “Hey. Isn't it about time you cut your hair?”</p><p>Hokuto groaned, letting Juri lean his weight into him as he only desperately tried to keep his head from swaying too much. “It's a style, Juri.”</p><p>“Is it a style or are you being lazy?”</p><p>“It's a <em> style</em>. I literally asked my barber to do it like this.”</p><p>“You look like you could be your dog.”</p><p>Juri beckoned Pochi over, who pranced over to him eagerly. Pochi had already grown attached to both of the frequent guests, happily playing with the familiar faces.</p><p>“Don't you think your owner looks too much like you??” Juri asked Pochi in a voice that only excited the puppy as he ruffled his fur. “He's stealing from you, huh?? He's taking your look, huh???”</p><p>“Well—” Jesse said with a laugh, sitting back up to take another drink. “They do say dogs do end up looking like their owners.”</p><p>Hokuto couldn't deny his likeness to his dog, but in all honesty, it was all just coincidence. The dog next door to his childhood home happened to give birth to a litter of babies and his mom, knowing his fondness for dogs, gave Hokuto an offer he couldn't bring himself to refuse. There were many different colors of the squirming little puppies, but the single dog with black fur somehow bonded to him like he was always meant to take him home.</p><p>He groaned before taking another gulp of water in hopes of quelling the spinning of his head. “Is there a problem with that?”</p><p>“No, not at all,” Juri smiled.</p><p>Hokuto had heard the sound of Pochi’s collar beside him, but he hadn't realized it was removed until Juri was looping it around his neck.</p><p>“Juri!! What the hell!!”</p><p>He tried to swat his hands away, but it was already too late as Juri secured the clasp in place. His friend just laughed, leaning back to get a view of Hokuto fumbling with the clasp behind his neck.</p><p>He was too drunk for this.</p><p>“It suits you!!” Juri smiled, cradling Pochi in his arms while Jesse gasped before bursting with laughter.</p><p>Hokuto was absolutely going to get a note from his neighbors tomorrow.</p><p>“You look so cute, Hokuto!!” Jesse reached over to pet him to which Hokuto, at first conceded to, letting Jesse ruffle his hair for a moment before finally pushing his hand away. “It'd look even better without your glasses!”</p><p>Without his glasses, Hokuto might as well have been blind. Which he basically was after Juri plucked them off his face.</p><p>“Alright guys, that's enough—”</p><p>“Does the puppy wanna go outside? Do you wanna play outside??”</p><p>“Guys–!!”</p><p>“Come on! Let's go outside!”</p><p>“Hey!!”</p><p>Well, without the unnecessary details, Hokuto was shut outside his back door.</p><p>Maybe Juri was just making a point to him about whenever he just let Pochi outside to prance around to do whatever, but it never was a problem before. He watched where Pochi went for the most part and he was always there when he came to the door, but perhaps Juri just wanted to emphasize that he didn't watch him close enough.</p><p>At least there were only short structural walls separating the back doors of the ground level apartments. It was just a simple walk around the building to get back to the front door, but the added blur from his drinks layered with his naturally poor eyesight made it much more arduous than he had imagined. Not to mention that it was cold outside, but not cold enough to kill his buzz.</p><p>He stumbled through the grass, the dew wetting his feet as he walked with his eyes closed tight, hoping to settle the stirring of his stomach. In retrospect, it wasn't a good choice considering how the only thing worse than being visually impaired was to be blind, but despite the reflections on his own actions later, it didn't change how he fell, failing to catch himself against what could have only been one of his neighbor's glass doors.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>His hand impacting the glass pane wasn't exactly what he would’ve called quiet.</p><p>He prayed whoever was inside didn't come out to check.</p><p>If his neighbor found him drunk wearing a dog collar outside their backdoor, Hokuto wasn't sure he would be able to stay living in his neighborhood.</p><p>He would have to move out in shame. Never show his face around here again.</p><p>
<em> Please. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please don't come outside. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Please just be asleep. </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Please</em></b>.</p><p>The snap of the lock coming undone sounded from the door.</p><p><b> <em>Fuck</em></b>.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Pochi~ It's cold, so come on and—-”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Well.</p><p>If anything was going to sober him up, it was the attractive man that almost glowed like an angel from the golden living room lights pouring over his image.</p><p>Hokuto was sober enough to not blabber like an idiot to explain exactly why he was on all fours outside the man’s door, but he was still drunk enough to lean into the man’s touch as he rubbed under his chin.</p><p>This was embarrassing.</p><p>This was horrible.</p><p>He didn't understand why this man mistook him for a dog, but he was also the dumbass who enjoyed the gentle scratching of his fingers underneath the stiff collar. He didn't know why it felt so comfortable. It just did. As if he had an itch to scratch he couldn't reach.</p><p>But now, Hokuto had to make the horrible choice of deciding on telling the truth part way through being caressed like a wild dog or to just play along with it until he could escape. He thought long and hard as his eyes closed along with the comforting rubs on his neck as he debated with himself on which one was the least worst of social suicide.</p><p>In the end, the ultimate decision was made when he was given the offer of food.</p><p>Hokuto couldn't remember the last time he had a solid meal. His late nights at work caused his diet to mostly consist of thinly made recipes or instant foods from the convenience stores, mixed in with various snacks. The curry that was offered to him was hearty and delicious with a rice that couldn't be described as anything less than perfectly cooked.</p><p>And the gentle playing of his hair was only a bonus.</p><p>Hokuto shouldn't have done it.</p><p>He knew he shouldn't have done it.</p><p>He shouldn't have laid his head in his lap, but his drowsiness defeated his better judgment and the moment the man began to comb his fingers through his hair, he understood what it meant to be touch starved.</p><p>It felt so good. It was so soothing Hokuto felt like he could have melted under his hands. The man’s thin fingers were nimble and careful as they traced their nails through his hair and along his neck in ways he never thought possible. Whatever aches he had from his drinks were fading away with each threading of his hands through his hair.</p><p>He was crazy to think he wouldn't fall asleep because of <em> course </em> he fell asleep. The playing with his hair might as well have been a lullaby to a child as he closed his eyes while wrapped up in the warmth of the kotatsu and the trailing caresses along his ear.</p><p>He was just lucky that he woke up just before the sun rose.</p><p>Hokuto had almost jolted up, but got up slowly, preferring to keep the man asleep as he removed himself from his lap.</p><p>God. If he was pretty before, he was even prettier now with the alcohol finally burned off from his system as their faces nearly met after Hokuto pulled the blanket of the kotatsu back over his lap.</p><p>But now wasn't the time to ponder his host’s appearance.</p><p>He had to get out.</p><p><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... You cleaned up before you left?...”</p><p>Hokuto confirmed with a guilty weight in his nod.</p><p>“I… I didn't want you to feel like I had been there…”</p><p>Taiga’s brow pinched. “But… now you're at my front door?”</p><p>Hokuto seemed to nearly recoil as he covered his face with his free hand in shame.</p><p>Woops.</p><p>Perhaps Taiga shouldn't have said that, but at the same time he still didn't understand.</p><p>If he didn't want him to know he was there, then why would he admit to all of it only a few hours later?</p><p>“I… I-I just—”</p><p>Hokuto didn't want to say it.</p><p>He wouldn't say it. Not now, at least.</p><p>At the forefront of his mind, he knew he couldn't avoid his own neighbor that only lived four doors down. Eventually, they would cross paths and it seemed better to tear off the bandage now than to let it cook and only be more embarrassing later.</p><p>And deep inside, he already missed that touch.</p><p>He wanted to feel his fingers in his hair again.</p><p>“I– um… Y-You had said something last night… About how you wouldn't– or if it was– uh–...”</p><p>Taiga had said a lot of things last night. He couldn't be sure exactly what thing Hokuto was talking about.</p><p>“... Yes?...”</p><p>“I was wondering… if…”</p><p>Hokuto covered his face again.</p><p>“I was wondering if… you would like to go on a–... um… a da—”</p><p>Suddenly, Hokuto’s arm was lurched forward.</p><p>Unbeknownst to either of them, Pochi had seen a bird outside Taiga’s back window. Mindless of his own strength and the leash on his collar, he had lunged into the apartment, taking Hokuto with him.</p><p>Would it have been smarter to just let the leash go? Maybe. But out of impulse, Hokuto held tight, letting his dog yank him forward, inside Taiga’s home.</p><p>Into Taiga.</p><p>The only thing Hokuto could do was try to catch himself, but with the tangling of his and Taiga’s feet, he had no choice but to catch himself against the door with his hands planted against it.</p><p>It hurt. His palms stung as he hissed, hoping Pochi hadn't made too much of a mess now that his leash was let loose in the stumble, but that quickly became the least of his worries.</p><p>Because when he opened his eyes, he found Taiga looking at him with his back flat against the door, pinned between his arms.</p><p>He stammered as Pochi’s barks echoed in the background.</p><p>“Shit!! I-I’m so sorry—!! Are you okay?? I didn't think he was going to pull me like that, I—”</p><p>Hokuto apologized, but he didn't back away.</p><p>All he could think about was how Taiga was a hundred times more beautiful in focus.</p><p>His smile and the sound of his laughter were gorgeous too as Hokuto’s face burned.</p><p>“It's okay. You were saying?”</p><p>Taiga looked up at him.</p><p>The thick glasses Hokuto wore somehow made him cuter than he already was. Hokuto was certainly a man. All man. Not whatever he was that Taiga had foolishly thought the night before, but the way his tongue stumbled still made him look like a shy puppy.</p><p>Taiga straightened out, leaning against his door as Hokuto’s arms relaxed while he fought for his words.</p><p>“I-I was just saying– um…”</p><p>“Would you… like to uh–...”</p><p>“Go out on a date with me?...”</p><p>Taiga blinked.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“W–with Pochi!! I mean—” Hokuto corrected as Pochi forced himself in the small space between his and Taiga’s feet, wanting attention. “You knew his name so you’re the one who's been taking care of him every so often, right?... He's clearly attached to you…”</p><p>Taiga smiled, looking down at the puppy between their legs to scratch at his chin and neck with the familiar sound of his collar jingling away.</p><p>All of this was so absurd. It was a story he could tell his friends and they would, without a doubt, question its truth.</p><p>It really did feel like he was living in one of those silly dating games.</p><p>He wasn't all that upset about it, though.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“A date sounds nice.”</p><p>Because, apparently, he had made all the right choices to get the best ending.</p><p> </p><p>“With you and Pochi.”</p><p> </p>

</p><p>“You two know each other?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Call it serendipity or just stupid luck, but whatever it was, it didn't change that this wasn't exactly the response Taiga thought he would receive from Yugo when they arrived at their office together.</p><p>He thought something like ‘<em>wow I didn't think you would live in the same place as our co-worker</em>’ or ‘<em>how funny I found you an apartment in the same place as our colleague</em>’ would be more likely answers after Taiga discovered only just that he and Hokuto worked for the same company, but Yugo looked at them like he would have more surprised if the tea in his cup was actually black tea instead of green.</p><p>Well, as it turns out, Yugo only knew about the unit vacancy because of Hokuto’s notice. So Hokuto told Yugo, Yugo told Taiga, Yugo helped hire Taiga, Taiga moved in, Hokuto arrived at Taiga’s backdoor, whatever whatever, they started dating and the rest was history.</p><p>So was it serendipity or stupid luck?...</p><p>It didn't really matter, did it?</p><p>Whatever road it was still took them to the same destination, but Taiga was still surprised by how they both somehow masterfully managed to skirt around each other in the same office for so long.</p><p>“I don't… really like to go out much…”</p><p>Once Hokuto explained that to him during dinner, that was enough for Taiga to ignore all the finer details.</p><p>Much like Taiga was, Hokuto was a person who preferred to keep to himself. He didn't really like drinking parties and rarely accepted invites for dinner, and even if he had been the type to enjoy those outings, he was usually too busy working into the night.</p><p>As a scenario writer for the company, he worked late into the evenings. Not because his work lacked any quality, but because he didn't believe in the quality himself. Many times in the past, Yugo had told him his script was just fine before Hokuto went back and edited it for, what Yugo was told but didn't believe would be, “one last time”. He worked until he was more or less satisfied before picking up a convenience store bento and going home to get what little sleep he could.</p><p>Otherwise, Hokuto was a rather stoic presence in the office. After commuting to work together, Taiga chose not to bother him, only catching glimpses of his furrowed brow and the reflection of his computer in his glasses from across the room. He worked hard and quietly by himself with a stern look, evading trivial office small talk even after Taiga spoke to him for the first time in hours, only to tell him he'd be heading back first.</p><p>But when Hokuto came home, his hard shell came crumbling apart.</p><p>When Hokuto knocked on his door with Pochi along with him, it was usually a fight to see who could claim Taiga’s lap first.</p><p>They would share a meal before Hokuto waited like a patient dog, quietly anticipating for the moment that Taiga would ask if he wished to lay down, and Taiga could tell from the way he quickly ate his food before fidgeting with his phone. Taiga felt guilty for picking Pochi up from his comfortable spot each time, but the way Hokuto’s exhaustion seemed to all melt away from the very moment he combed his fingers through his hair made Pochi’s momentary whines worthwhile.</p><p>It was so cute.</p><p>Hokuto was no less needy and anxious as a new puppy, not wanting to ask for himself but only waiting for his owner to give the okay before completely indulging himself in his allowances. Taiga couldn't count the amount of times he had let Hokuto fall asleep with his head on his lap or sitting between his legs at the foot of the couch with his cheek resting upon his knee, but it wasn't like Taiga was complaining.</p><p>He loved the feeling of Hokuto’s hair. His gentle waves were silky soft as they curled around his fingers with each slow stroke through his jet black strands. Even the way the locks would wind and mold with the trail of his nails along Hokuto’s scalp was a pleasure to watch.</p><p>And, of course, Hokuto was absolutely adorable before and after he melted under his touch.</p><p>That was the cherry on top.</p><p>“... Kyomoto?...”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Taiga’s eyes were still on his TV when Hokuto raised his head, Taiga’s hand falling away.</p><p>It had been a few months since they formally started dating and this became their usual routine. Hokuto would come over with his puppy for dinner before they relaxed for the rest of the night.</p><p>Today was like any other. They were laying across the couch with Taiga’s head propped up against the armrest with Hokuto laying over him, his cheek pillowed on his stomach as Taiga idly played with his hair.</p><p>But now Hokuto was leaning over him, quietly waiting for something that Taiga didn't understand.</p><p>“... What's wrong?...” He asked.</p><p>Hokuto shook his head, the mess of his hair shaking with it. “There's nothing wrong–…”</p><p>“And you~. Do you have a problem too~?”</p><p>To Hokuto’s dismay, as soon as they began to talk, Pochi stirred from his spot on the couch pillow Taiga surrendered to him, trotting over to paw and nudge at Taiga’s arm to beg for some attention. Hokuto knew Taiga was helpless to give it to him as he began to coo at the pup and scratched behind his ear and along his neck.</p><p>“Kyomoto, can you listen to me for a second?...”</p><p>Taiga laughed as Pochi shook his coat out, his collar jingling along with it before Taiga went on, itching his chin.</p><p>“Hm? I'm listening.”</p><p>He wasn't.</p><p>Hokuto frowned. “Please, can you just—”</p><p>“Does this puppy want scratches too?”</p><p>“... Huh?”</p><p>Hokuto had a hard time not letting his heart melt whenever Taiga smiled at him. It made everything wrong feel right for a moment as he watched those lips curl into their shape and today was no different when that perfectly tilted grin beamed up at him while he saw his dog relax into Taiga's hand in a way that was truly endearing as it was relatable.</p><p>Because Hokuto, too, became jello under Taiga’s touch as Taiga reached up and rubbed his fingers along the back of his ears and around the curve of his jaw.</p><p>It was really unbelievable how good Taiga was with his hands.</p><p>It was no wonder he was an artist.</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes drifted shut as the slow strokes of Taiga’s gentle scratching made their way along the back of his neck and down it to the edge of his shirt collar.</p><p>“Feel good?...”</p><p>Hokuto sighed in defeat, laying his head back down onto Taiga’s chest as he tucked his chin a little to give more of his nape for Taiga to run his nails over.</p><p>“... Mhm… feels good…”</p><p>Taiga’s chuckle rumbled softly in his chest.</p><p>“I'm glad.”</p><p>He buried his nose into Taiga’s shirt as he let out a long drawn out breath.</p><p>

</p><p>“What do you like to have for lunch?”</p><p>“Oh… Uh-... I usually just eat what's convenient–”</p><p>“So like something from the convenience store? Aww, you should eat better than that!”</p><p>“I really don't mind–”</p><p>“Come on, let us take you out to eat today!!”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga quietly sipped from his hot cup of tea as the two beside him peered through the glass window of the break room behind him, watching the conversation unfold.</p><p>“Wow,” Shintaro said simply, taking another bite of his snack. “... He’s popular.”</p><p>Juri clicked his tongue.</p><p>“He really is…”</p><p>Tanaka Juri and Morimoto Shintaro were co-workers that Taiga had grown close with. Juri was another writer on their project who was close with Hokuto, while Shintaro was a sound designer that had worked with Yugo in the past. Usually their conversations took place outside of work over a meal or some drinks along with the ever lively Jesse Lewis from management that they all knew well, but right now it was just the three of them. In the break room. Observing Hokuto talk to a pair of their female coworkers like a wild animal behind the glass window.</p><p>Well, at least Juri and Shintaro were.</p><p>Taiga just stared down into his paper cup, watching his teabag slow seep dark wisps of amber colors into the hot water as Juri huffed, crossing his arms with his can of Red Bull at his lips.</p><p>“What the hell… A guy gets a haircut and finally wears his contacts and now he's the talk of the town. What's with that?”</p><p>“It's like he hasn't been working here for years or something.”</p><p>From the way the girls talked to him, Hokuto might as well have only joined the company today. They spoke with such great excitement and interest like he was the new boy at school, hovering around him and asking him about himself and his hobbies as if they hadn't had the last couple years to ask before. But, to be fair, it wasn't completely outlandish to think that the girls truly did believe that this was Hokuto’s first day. Like mentioned before, Hokuto was someone who kept to himself. He nearly disappeared into the background unless work directly involved him. Perhaps they only put a face to his name today.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Also his hair was short.</p><p>Hokuto’s image almost completely eclipsed how he appeared before. The curls that once covered his face and hid his brow were cut back into a simple and stylish trim. The waves were tamed down and pushed back into a clean swoop of his bangs with the rest combed behind his ear, blending into the short even cut in the back. And if that wasn't enough, the thick round frames he wore on his nose were replaced with contacts, leaving the view of his face fully unobstructed.</p><p>It was a total transformation. A complete one-eighty, though it wasn't like Hokuto hadn’t always been handsome. Taiga knew that.</p><p>It was just that now, all of it was out on display.</p><p>Shintaro smirked at Juri. “Are you mad because he's becoming more popular than you?”</p><p>Neither of them saw Shintaro shove the rest of his food in his mouth as Taiga continued to look down into his drink and Juri kept his eyes out the window.</p><p>“No, no.” Juri waved his hand blindly at the puffy cheeked Shintaro. “You don't understand. I'm more pissed that it took me <em>months</em> to build a good reputation with the girls but this guy can just walk in with a fresh cut and now I'm suddenly chopped liver. Like, what was all that time for?! Give my time back to me!”</p><p>Shintaro raised up his hands when Juri held out his empty palm to him, swallowing down the rest of his food. “Don't ask me for it! I'm not the one who told you to do all of that!” he said as he pushed Juri’s hand away from him. “Why don't you just be happy for him?”</p><p>Juri sighed, shoving his hand back into his pocket as he drank from his Red Bull that was rapidly growing empty. “Well, in the end it's not that important. What's more important is what the boyfriend thinks.”</p><p>“Right, Kyomo?”</p><p>They both turned to Taiga.</p><p>But they were only met with silence as Taiga finished his tea.</p><p>Shintaro chuckled meekly. “You don't seem too happy.”</p><p>Taiga didn't look at Hokuto and the girls, not because he didn't want to, but because he didn't care. His back was facing the window as he emptied his drink, uninterested in their conversation, but still with a crease in his brow showing his frustration.</p><p>“Are you mad that he's popular?” Shintaro asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Are you mad he's around girls? Do you want me to break up their conversation?” Juri offered.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Then what's wrong?”</p><p>“You wouldn't understand.”</p><p>Taiga didn't say and never gave them an answer because of exactly that. Juri and Shintaro wouldn't understand. Taiga didn't think anyone would understand because it was so simple and so complicated at the same time.</p><p>No, Taiga didn't care that girls wanted to talk to him. He didn't care if they asked for his number. He didn't even care if they just wanted to flirt with him over dinner. It didn't matter. None of that mattered.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>What <em> mattered </em> was that all of his cute long wavy locks were <b>gone</b>.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga would agree that the new cut looked great and Hokuto had his own independence to do what he wanted with his own hair, but that didn't mean that Taiga didn't throw a fuss the night Hokuto told him he was getting it cut.</p><p>“What!? Why!?” Taiga had asked in a raised voice, the sudden shift of the relaxed environment making Pochi bark in excitement. “No!! I don't want you to cut it!”</p><p>Taiga sat up as Hokuto leaned back, taking his glasses from the coffee table.</p><p>“I… I just feel like it.”</p><p>“I don't like that reason!!” Taiga frowned as he reached forward to comb Hokuto’s hair away from his face while Hokuto pushed back on his glasses. “I like your hair! It's cute like this!!”</p><p>Still, Hokuto got up from the couch and scooped the large puppy into his arms, quieting down his barking. “I just feel like it's something I need to do.”</p><p>“But why?? Hokuto wait–!”</p><p>By the time Taiga had gotten onto his feet, Hokuto had already hooked Pochi’s leash onto his collar, signaling it was time for them to leave. “I'm sorry, Kyomoto. I'll ask for your forgiveness after…”</p><p>“Just trust me that I have my reasons.”</p><p>Pochi licked his chin as Hokuto leaned forward, pressing a brief kiss on Taiga’s temple.</p><p>“Goodnight…”</p><p>The next week Taiga saw him, all of Hokuto’s hair was gone.</p><p>All the volume and fluffy curls had been smothered and smoothed back into a simple and suiting look.</p><p>It looked great on him, but it just wasn't the <em>same</em>.</p><p>Even the glasses Hokuto traded for contacts just didn't feel the <em>same</em>.</p><p>Hokuto was still cute, sure, but the way he was cute just wasn't the <em>same</em>!!</p><p>If Taiga could have asked for a refund on his boyfriend, he would have. He wanted his cute boyfriend back.</p><p>He wanted the mess and the shaggy waves back. He wanted to feel the long locks and he wanted to play with them and curl them around his fingers. He wanted to be able to watch the way his hands would get lost in the jet black and all of that just wasn't possible with his short hair.</p><p>Taiga knew he was acting immature when he gave Hokuto the silent treatment on their way home. He felt bad for the way it made Hokuto worry and hover around him the whole way back, but it was better than saying something on a crowded train he would regret.</p><p>After saying their goodnights and goodbyes at the entrance of their complex, Taiga contemplated going over to at least apologize, but Hokuto knocked on his door before he could even settle with his own decision.</p><p>“... Can I come in?...”</p><p>Taiga sighed.</p><p>If Taiga wasn't already going to say yes regardless, the way Hokuto asked and looked at him like a dejected pet waiting outside in the cold made it very difficult to say no.</p><p>Even with short hair, Hokuto was still cute.</p><p>He stepped back and let him inside.</p><p>“Of course. Come on, it's cold outside.”</p><p>As Hokuto shed his layers, Taiga went to fill and turn on the water boiler. All the while, he could feel Hokuto’s eyes on his back.</p><p>Hokuto was studying his mood.</p><p>Taiga could tell because it was exactly the same gaze he followed him with the whole trip home.</p><p>“Come. Sit down.”</p><p>Well, they might as well talk about it while the water boiled.</p><p>“... Do you really hate it that much?” Hokuto finally asked.</p><p>Taiga let out a long breath as he dropped himself on his couch, Hokuto following closely to sit beside him. “No, it's fine… It looks good.”</p><p>“Is it really?...”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“... Are you sure?”</p><p>When Taiga raised his hand, Hokuto was already lowering his head, allowing Taiga to fiddle with the cropped strands.</p><p>He frowned. “It's just not the same…”</p><p>The ends were short and the wax applied to style his hair strangled the waves and stiffened their soft texture. It didn't feel anything like it had when it was long.</p><p>“I miss how cute your fluffy hair was. I want it back.”</p><p>“Does it look bad?”</p><p>“No, I really mean it when I say it looks good…” Taiga said as he used both hands to thread through the back of Hokuto’s hair, feeling the new length. “It's just–...”</p><p>“Just what?...”</p><p>“You're just not the cute puppy you used to be anymore…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“...”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It went quiet, though Taiga didn't notice.</p><p>He was too busy mourning over the short strands along the back of Hokuto’s neck that no longer fell over his nape to notice the silence that fell over them.</p><p>His fingers were buried in the trim when Hokuto suddenly grasped his forearms, stopping the path of his hands through his locks.</p><p>Only then did Taiga notice the hush of the room.</p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“... Kyomoto…”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga almost flinched.</p><p>This was a voice he had never heard from Hokuto before. It was low and stern and nearly made him shudder as Hokuto’s lowered gaze bore into him.</p><p>He didn't know how long Hokuto had been staring at him. Taiga had been so caught up with his hair he didn't pay any mind to notice, but now, he couldn't bring himself to look away.</p><p>Hokuto had always been handsome. Though Taiga always called him cute and sweet, he still knew that Hokuto was very handsome.</p><p>So then why was it only now that it made his heart skip?</p><p>Taiga tried to pull his arms away but Hokuto’s grip tightened as his gaze sank deeper.</p><p>“Kyomoto…” Hokuto repeated, though it felt as if Taiga had never heard his own name before.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“You know I'm a man. Not a dog, right?...”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>A shiver shot up Taiga’s spine.</p><p>“Wh— Of course! W-why would you even ask—” Taiga stammered, his mouth suddenly feeling horribly dry as Hokuto slipped Taiga’s finger out of his hair.</p><p>“You always call me cute and you always pet me like I’m Pochi. I don't mind and I love the way it feels but…”</p><p>Taiga hadn't realized just how hard his heart was pounding until his back met the flat of the couch. He was speechless, at a loss for words as his arms were pinned down against the soft cushions with Hokuto moving over him.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why was his heart racing so fast??</p><p>The messy hair that usually hid Hokuto’s face let Taiga see every detail that made Hokuto so stunningly gorgeous. His sculpted jaw. His cut cheekbones. His shapely brow. His sharp eyes. All enhanced by the ceiling light that illuminated him from behind.</p><p>Of course, he loved Hokuto.</p><p>He loved his cute and adorable boyfriend Hokuto.</p><p>But why did it all suddenly feel so <em>different</em>?</p><p>Taiga swallowed hard.</p><p>“Taiga…” Hokuto spoke softly, his voice nearly rumbling in his throat. “I… I want you to see me seriously.”</p><p>Taiga blinked. “What…? What do you mean–...”</p><p>Hokuto’s grip tightened on his arms.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I want to love you tonight as a man.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Taiga wasn’t sure if anyone could possibly turn as red and as quickly as he had.</p><p>His face was completely painted scarlet as he fought to make words.</p><p>“H-huh???”</p><p>“W-w-wait!! Hokuto–!!”</p><p>Hokuto kissed him before he could protest again.</p><p>They had kissed before. They had shared sweet pecks and small signs of affection with each other that brought a shy flustering feeling after, but it had never been like this. This time, it made Taiga go utterly breathless.</p><p>Was this really all because of a simple haircut?</p><p>Was a haircut enough to make his arms go weak from Hokuto rolling his lips into his again?</p><p>Admittedly, Taiga did often see Hokuto as a cute pet who sought his attention, but he always knew he was human. It wasn't like he was delusional, but perhaps he had been blinded by how adorable Hokuto was to consider what that meant. Hokuto was more than a puppy and he was more than his sweet boyfriend that wanted his attention.</p><p>He was a man.</p><p>A horribly attractive man with a fresh trim that made him melt from his kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“H-Hokuto–!” Taiga gasped once Hokuto had moved his kisses from his lips to his neck. “W-wait! What–what about Pochi?? We can't just—!”</p><p>“I fed him and gave him water before I came over.”</p><p>The feeling of Hokuto’s tongue licking under his ear made Taiga shudder.</p><p>“But w-won't he–??”</p><p>“He’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Wait— Hokuto, please— I've never done this with a man before—”</p><p>Hokuto backed away to quickly remove his shirt, his hair tousling as the fabric pulled over his head.</p><p>Christ. Had he always been this toned?...</p><p>Or had Taiga just been too dense to ever notice?</p><p>Taiga just stared as Hokuto fell back over him.</p><p>He spoke in a near whisper as he led Taiga’s arms around his neck.</p><p>“It's okay.”</p><p>When he took the backs of Taiga’s hands to lead them into his hair, it didn't take even a second for Taiga to bury his fingers into the dark strands. He ruined the careful styling, breaking the holds and messing the locks in a way that made Hokuto look as if he was already finished with what they were about to do.</p><p>The way his hair fell over his eyes in pieces and pushed back only by the will of Taiga’s fingers made him sensual in ways Taiga couldn't have ever imagined as Hokuto led his legs around his waist.</p><p>Taiga’s heart skipped again.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I have.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next day, Hokuto returned to work with his messy hair and his thick glasses. It was more contained and trimmed, but his heavy bangs returned back to its place over his brow.</p><p>“What? You're already done with the new look?” Juri asked, leaning over his desk to peek over at his coworker.</p><p>“I never planned on keeping it,” Hokuto sighed as he set down his bag. “I'm probably going to let it grow out again.”</p><p>Juri crossed his arms, sitting back in his chair with his lips flattened in a straight line as Hokuto sat down at his desk. “You're just wasting all that effort?? People thought it looked nice…”</p><p>“Don't worry about it. I got what I needed out of it.”</p><p>“Got what?? I don't get it.”</p><p>“You wouldn't understand.”</p><p>“I feel like I'm hearing that a lot lately.”</p><p>At the other side of the office, Taiga was blankly staring at his monitors. He had work to do. He had a lot of work to do, but his mind wouldn't pull itself out of the clouds to do anything more than log in.</p><p>“Hey, are you alright?”</p><p>Taiga jolted back into the present when Shintaro nudged him, his backpack still on his shoulder and his scarf tight around his neck.</p><p>“Um… Yeah,” Taiga replied with a delay, rubbing his eyes under his glasses as he straightened back into his seat. “Everything is fine.”</p><p>Shintaro’s eyebrow raised. “You sure? You seem a little tired. Did you and Hokuto get in a fight or something? I saw him in the hall and he's not all done up like yesterday.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. We're all good.”</p><p>No, they hadn't gotten into a fight, but Shintaro was right that he was a little tired, though it was more like his body was tired. And it ached. It ached in places Taiga never thought could ache. Otherwise, he was fine.</p><p>He probably just needed a moment to himself to reflect on his own tastes and kinks…</p><p>“... Alright, well if you say so,” Shintaro said, with a hint of doubt, but not enough to insist which Taiga was always thankful for. He only ever asked enough questions to show he cared, but never too much to pry. It wasn't really something Shintaro could help with anyway.</p><p>… Or maybe–</p><p>“Holler if you need me.”</p><p>“Wait, Shintaro…”</p><p>Shintaro had already begun to head towards his own desk, but when Taiga spoke up, he pivoted on his feet, spinning back around to face him. “That was fast.”</p><p>“You have big dogs… right?”</p><p>That was a strange question. Taiga could tell it confused his friend from the way his face scrunched for a moment. He had never shown any interest in his dogs before, but the hesitation quickly vanished as Shintaro nodded with a smile, digging his hand into his pocket to take out his phone to look for a photo. “Yeah! I have a couple.”</p><p>Taiga leaned over to peer over Shintaro’s arm as he lowered his phone to show him.</p><p>It was a cute photo. It was of him and his two dogs which he held and cuddled to himself closely. They were definitely on the larger side, in size and in volume. They were far from lap dogs, but that didn't seem to bother Shintaro as he coddled them and held them in his arms as if they might as well have been the size of a terrier.</p><p>“Why? What's up?”</p><p>Shintaro dropped his phone back into his pocket as Taiga shifted back into his seat. “Well… Have you ever, like…” He waved his hands nebulously as he tried to explain. “... Felt that your dog owns you instead?...”</p><p>Shintaro crossed his arms. “Huh?... What do you mean?”</p><p>Taiga waved his hands some more. “Like... Have they ever overwhelmed you and all of a sudden they're in control instead of you?...”</p><p>He was struggling on how to put it into words. He knew he wasn't making much sense at all because he wasn't actually talking about a dog. He would have completely understood if Shintaro had decided to just brush him off as crazy, but it was just like him to reply with only laughter.</p><p>“Kyomo. That's just part of having a dog.” Shintaro patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry, you'll get used to it.”</p><p>“Oh… Okay… Thanks, Shintaro…”</p><p>Shintaro left him with one more nudge against his side before Taiga waited until he had walked away far enough to bury his face in his hands.</p><p>Really?</p><p>This was all part of it?</p><p>Well, just as Hokuto made sure to show him last night, Taiga did not own a dog.</p><p>He had a boyfriend.</p><p>Even if that boyfriend was cute and liked to be pet just like his canine counterpart, he was indeed a <em>man</em> in every sense of the word and every man had their needs.</p><p>And it wasn't like Taiga didn't enjoy it. He did. He did, more than he had expected.</p><p>Hokuto was great. He looked great. He did great. He <em>felt</em> great. He was a man and Taiga didn't need any more convincing after being reminded until after the hours of the evening passed midnight.</p><p>Yet, as Hokuto melted under his hands when Taiga ran his fingers through his sweat streaked hair and gave a pleased sigh from him trailing his nails down his nape and over his shoulder blades, Taiga was still reminded of his cute puppy.</p><p>Taiga rubbed his eyes again before focusing back on his screen with a sigh.</p><p>Well, it was fine. It's not like it was an actual problem and it wasn't anything he couldn't handle.</p><p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Aaaaaaahh I have to admit I'm feeling a little worn down!!! haha</p><p>There's so much I want to write but doesn't seem to make it onto paper. I don't like any of my words but I feel like I shouldn't be so harsh on myself and just... write. But even then, the words just don't flow like they used to. I have a desire to return to the time where I could write until my hands felt like they were going to fall off, but perhaps those times are just past me at this point.</p><p>I want to write. I want to write long form again. I want to write angst. But there's something blocking my brain.</p><p>Well anyways haha. This is just a little extra. I'm a bit tired so I think I'm not going to say much, but I hope this is fun!! It all started with the idea of Hokuto expressing how he's not a dog and it all built from there. I had his City cover hair in mind for his haircut by the way!!! It's such a good look haha he looks very handsome. I do still have one more extra on this. I'm not sure how much I like it, I think I've already completely rewritten it once, but I don't doubt I'll rewrite it again haha.</p><p>I have a lot of drafts going on. I'm not sure if any of them will make they're way out of the woods though. There's a lot of smut somehow. I keep thinking of writing smut then I never finish it... and I probably never will!!! but I hope to at least get the next extra out and then who knows what will come out of me next. I may try to focus on some longer fics, but the inspiration/motivation has been tough.</p><p>If you want to leave a comment!!! Please do!!!!!! I really love receiving comments even though I take forever to respond I'm very sorry, but they really do make me very happy.</p><p>I have a twitter where I mostly just talk about how handsome Taiga or Hokuto is, but from time to time I'll talk about writing and post my fic updates! If you wanna talk, my DMs are open and we can chat or if you have any questions!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it!!!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p><p>Thank you so much for reading!!! Goodbye!!!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Ah. Its been a while!!!</p><p>A while ago I mentioned I wanted to write something a little more light-hearted and this was the story I had in mind. Its been in progress for a while and a lot of WIPs have come and gone between me starting and finishing it, but now its finally complete haha. I found a bit of a stride as I was writing this, so somehow I managed to reach the end.</p><p>Did I surprise you at all?? Hokuto was real after all haha! I feel like most people could have guessed, but I wonder if I got anyone to believe there was actually some sort of transformation. I hope it was fun! I do have two more parts for this story that kind of serve as extras. Originally I had hoped to just post them all at once, but I'm choosing to just have something up for now! As I mentioned in the beginning notes, the hair I imagined for Hokuto was the shaggy fluffy cut he had during his Suzume promo. I thought it was so cute haha I felt it fit perfectly!</p><p>I have a lot of WIPs floating around. At the moment, I write whatever links with me the most. I'm trying to be a little less hard on myself and just let stories be as they may without writing in rewriting over and over. In the future, I may post some fics that aren't exactly perfect, but I hope are still enjoyable. I like to write and want to write. I want to find that drive and motivation where I write until my thumbs hurt again!</p><p>Anyways, this was just a fun light fic! I'd love to hear what you think especially now that I don't write as much! I always like to read what everyone has to say!</p><p>I have a twitter! I just post whatever and every so often, but it is mostly kyomo or kyomohoku. I also will post all and any fic updates that may come! Also if you ever want to talk or have any questions, please feel free to dm me! I'm always happy to chat!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/pprkkr_</a></p><p>I also have a curiouscat if anyone wishes to use it!!!<br/><a rel="nofollow">https://curiouscat.live/pprkkr_</a></p><p>Thank you so much for reading!!!</p></blockquote>
