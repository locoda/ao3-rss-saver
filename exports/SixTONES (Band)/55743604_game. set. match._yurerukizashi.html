<div class="userstuff">
<p>The August sun beats down mercilessly as Taiga steps out of the car, the humid air already clinging to his skin. Beads of sweat form on his brow, but he barely notices, his mind focused solely on the day ahead.</p><p>The All-Japan Junior Tennis Tournament — the pinnacle of the junior tennis circuit in Japan. A chance to prove himself, to show the world what Taiga Kyomoto is made of.</p><p>As he walks toward the entrance of the Ariake Tennis Park, he can feel the energy in the air, the excitement and anticipation of the fans, the players, the coaches. It’s electric, and he can’t help but feed off it, his own excitement building with each step.</p><p>“Taiga!” a voice calls out, and he turns to see his coach, Akanishi Jin, jogging to catch up with him. He’s been with Taiga since he first started playing competitively, guiding him, supporting him, pushing him to be the best he can be.</p><p>Taiga owes him a lot.</p><p>“You ready?” Jin asks, falling into step beside him.</p><p>Taiga nods, a small smile playing on his lips. “Always.”</p><p>They make their way through the crowds, the chatter and laughter washing over them. Everywhere Taiga looks, there are people in tennis gear, rackets slung over shoulders, excitement etched on their faces. It’s a familiar sight, one that never fails to ignite a spark inside him.</p><p>As they approach the check-in desk, Taiga catches sight of my reflection in a nearby window. Short, dark brown hair frames his face, his doe eyes staring back at him with a determination that surprises even him. At sixteen, he’s still growing into his features, but there’s a sense of purpose in the set of his jaw, the angle of his chin</p><p>He’s here to win.</p><p>“Taiga Kyomoto, checking in for the second round,” he says to the woman behind the desk, handing over his ID.</p><p>She smiles, tapping away at her keyboard before handing Taiga a badge. “Good luck out there,” she says.</p><p>Taiga nods his thanks.</p><p>He and Jin make their way to the practice courts, the sound of tennis balls being hit growing louder with each step. It’s a familiar rhythm, one that he’s heard countless times before, but it never fails to set his heart racing.</p><p>“Your opponent today is Jesse Lewis,” Jin says as they claim an empty court. “He’s a bit of an unknown, but from what I’ve seen, he’s got a lot of potential.”</p><p>Taiga nods, taking his racket out of his bag and giving it a few experimental swings. “I watched his first-round match yesterday. He’s spontaneous, unpredictable. But he gets distracted easily. If I can keep him on his toes, I should be able to wear him down.”</p><p>Jin nods, a proud smile on his face. “That’s my boy. Always thinking, always strategizing. Just remember, don’t underestimate him. He may be young, but he’s got heart.”</p><p>Taiga nods, taking his coach’s words to heart. He’s seen too many players fall victim to their own arrogance, thinking they had the match in the bag only to be blindsided by an unexpected comeback.</p><p>He won’t make that mistake.</p><p>They spend the next hour practicing, Jin feeding Taiga balls as he works on his footwork, his strokes, his serves. The sun is relentless, the heat oppressive, but he barely notices, lost in the rhythm of the game.</p><p>Finally, it's time.</p><p>Taiga and Jin make their way to the assigned court, the crowds already gathering in the stands. He can feel their eyes on him, hear the whispers of excitement as they recognize him.</p><p>“That’s Taiga Kyomoto,” they murmur. “The prodigy.”</p><p>Taiga tries to block it out, to focus on the task at hand. But there’s a part of him that thrills at the attention, at the knowledge that he’s making a difference, that he’s inspiring others to pick up a racket and give it a try.</p><p>As he steps onto the court, he catches sight of his opponent across the net.</p><p>Jesse Lewis.</p><p>He’s tall and lanky, with a mop of dark brown hair and an easy smile. He looks relaxed, almost excited to be here, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he waits for the match to start.</p><p>“Kyomoto-senpai!” he calls out as Taiga approaches the net for the pre-match handshake. “It’s an honor to play against you. I’ve been a fan since your debut at Junior Nationals three years ago.”</p><p>Taiga can’t help but smile at his opponent’s enthusiasm, even as he reminds himself to stay focused. “Thank you,” he says, shaking Jesse’s hand firmly. “Let’s have a good match.”</p><p>They take their positions, the crowd falling silent as the umpire calls for the start of the match. Taiga bounces the ball a few times, feeling the familiar weight in his hand, the texture of the felt against his palm.</p><p>Then, with a deep breath, he tosses it up and smashes it across the net.</p><p>The match is on.</p><p>From the start, it’s clear that Jesse is a wildcard. His shots are unpredictable, his movements erratic. He’ll hit a blistering forehand one moment, then a soft drop shot the next.</p><p>It’s maddening, trying to anticipate his next move, but Taiga forces himself to stay calm, to read Jesse’s body language, to trust his instincts.</p><p>Taiga takes the first set 6-0, his shots crisp and precise, his footwork flawless.</p><p>But Jesse isn't deterred. He comes back in the second set with a vengeance, his shots even more daring, his energy infectious. The crowd is loving it, cheering him on with every point, and Taiga can feel the momentum shifting.</p><p>But Taiga refuses to let it rattle him. He’s worked too hard, trained too long to let one set throw him off his game.</p><p>He digs deep, tapping into the well of determination that has carried him this far. He starts to mix up his shots, throwing in slices and drop shots to keep Jesse off balance.</p><p>It works, and he claims the second set 7-6.</p><p>By the third set, they’re both drenched in sweat, their lungs burning with exertion. But neither of them is willing to back down.</p><p>Jesse takes an early lead, his shots finding the corners with uncanny accuracy. But Taiga refuses to let him pull away. He fights for every point, chasing down balls that seem impossible to reach, throwing everything he has into every stroke.</p><p>It’s a battle of wills, a test of endurance. The crowd is on their feet, shouting themselves hoarse with every rally.</p><p>And then, finally, Taiga sees his chance.</p><p>Jesse hits a forehand that sails long, and Taiga pounces, smashing a winner down the line to claim the set 7-5.</p><p>The fourth set is a blur, both of them running on fumes but refusing to yield. Every point feels like a mini-war, each of them digging deep for one more shot, one more burst of energy.</p><p>But in the end, it’s Taiga experience that wins out. He reads Jesse’s shots a split second faster, anticipates his moves a heartbeat sooner.</p><p>And with a final, blistering serve, Taiga claims the match 6-4.</p><p>The crowd erupts in cheers as Taiga falls to his knees, his chest heaving with exhaustion and elation. He’s done it. He’s won.</p><p>One step closer to his goal of winning Nationals, of claiming the title that has eluded him for the past three years.</p><p>Taiga looks up to see Jesse standing at the net, his hand outstretched in congratulations. “Great match,” he says, his smile genuine despite the loss. “You really are something special, Taiga Kyomoto.”</p><p>He shakes Jesse’s hand, feeling a rush of respect for this young player who pushed him to his limits. “You’re not so bad yourself,” he says with a grin. “I have a feeling this won’t be the last time we meet on the court.”</p><p>Jesse laughs, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “I sure hope not. I’ve got a lot of catching up to do if I want to beat you next time.”</p><p>They make their way off the court, the adrenaline slowly fading as the reality of the win sinks in. Jin is waiting for Taiga, his face split in a proud grin.</p><p>“Well done, Taiga,” he says, clapping him on the shoulder. “You showed a lot of grit out there today. Keep playing like that, and you’ll be unstoppable.”</p><p>Taiga nods, too exhausted to speak.</p><p>But as he gathers his things and heads for the locker room, he can’t help but feel a sense of exhilaration. He’s one step closer to his dream, one match closer to proving to the world that he has what it takes to be the best.</p><p>But even as he basks in the glow of victory, he can’t shake the feeling that this is just the beginning. Jesse may have been an unknown today, but something tells Taiga he won’t stay that way for long. He’s got a fire in him, a hunger that matches Taiga’s own.</p><p>And Taiga has a feeling that the next time they meet on the court, it’s going to be one hell of a match.</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Tennis is more than just a sport to Taiga — it’s a calling, a purpose. It’s the one thing in his life that makes him feel truly alive, truly himself.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🎾</p><p>It is a pleasant April morning, the sky a soft, hazy blue with wisps of clouds hinting at the chance of rain later in the day. The air carries a delicate floral scent, courtesy of the cherry blossoms in full bloom across the city.</p><p>For Taiga, however, the beauty of spring is a distant backdrop as he focuses intently on the tennis match at hand.</p><p>The indoor court of the private club is a stark contrast to the gentle colors outside — all gleaming hardwood and crisp white lines. The rhythmic thwack of tennis balls against tightly strung racquets echoes through the space as Taiga and his practice partner, Shime, engage in a fierce rally.</p><p>Taiga’s movements are fluid and precise, his lean frame a blur of motion as he darts across the court. His hair is slightly damp with sweat, a few strands clinging to his forehead above his eyes.</p><p>Shime, on the other hand, exhibits a more cautious style of play. He patiently returns Taiga's aggressive shots, waiting for the right moment to strike. Though two years younger, Shime’s experience as a professional player is evident in his composed demeanor and calculated moves.</p><p>The two have been trading points for the better part of an hour, their contrasting strategies creating a captivating push and pull on the court. Taiga’s lightning-fast reflexes and daring shot placement keep Shime on his toes, forcing him to rely on his defensive prowess and consistency to stay in the game.</p><p>As the match wears on, however, Shime’s stamina begins to flag. Taiga seizes the opportunity, his eyes narrowing as he ramps up the intensity of his shots.</p><p>A blistering forehand down the line seals the deal, leaving Shime lunging in vain as the ball whizzes past.</p><p>“Game, set, match — Kyomoto,” Taiga announces, a satisfied smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He strides to the net to shake Shime’s hand, his grip firm and confident.</p><p>Shime, to his credit, seems unfazed by the loss. “Nice game, senpai.” He grins, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with his free hand. “Your reflexes never cease to amaze me.”</p><p>Taiga feels a rush of pride at the compliment, his chest swelling with the validation of his skills. Coming from a respected pro like Shime, the praise carries extra weight. “Thanks,” he replies, trying to sound nonchalant despite the giddiness bubbling up inside him. “You put up a great fight, as always.”</p><p>The two make their way off the court and toward the locker room, their tennis shoes squeaking against the polished floor. As they walk, Shime chatters animatedly about Taiga’s performance, dissecting specific shots and strategies with the keen eye of a seasoned player.</p><p>Taiga basks in the attention, relishing the opportunity to discuss the intricacies of the sport he loves with someone who understands it on a deep level. Too often, he finds himself holding back in conversations with his college teammates, many of whom lack the same passion and dedication to tennis that he and Shime share.</p><p>In the locker room, they quickly shower and change into fresh clothes, the humid air heavy with the mingled scents of sweat, soap, and deodorant. Taiga takes his time pulling on his glasses, savoring the last few moments of post-match euphoria before the reality of the day ahead sets in.</p><p>As they step out into the club’s lobby, a familiar figure awaits them — Jin, their coach and mentor. He exudes a quiet intensity, his lean frame and striking features bearing the marks of his own successful tennis career, cut short by injury.</p><p>“Shime, I’ve got good news,” Jin says by way of greeting, his deep voice cutting through the ambient noise of the lobby. “Your flights and sponsors for the Romanian Open in Bucharest are all set. You’re good to go.”</p><p>Shime’s face lights up at the announcement, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “Really? That’s fantastic, thank you so much, Coach Jin!” He starts to gush about the upcoming tournament, but quickly catches himself, glancing sideways at Taiga.</p><p>Taiga feels a pang of jealousy twist in his gut, his earlier elation fading as the harsh reality of his situation comes crashing back. While Shime, two years his junior, gets to jet off to international competitions and build his professional career, Taiga remains stuck in the amateur ranks, his dreams of going pro stymied by his parents’ insistence that he complete his college degree first.</p><p>It's a bitter pill to swallow, especially when Taiga knows he has the skills to compete at the highest levels. He’s a prodigy, <em>damn it</em>, with a game that could rival any player on the pro circuit.</p><p>But until he graduates, he’s forced to watch from the sidelines as his peers — including Shime, who, if he’s being honest, isn’t quite at Taiga’s level — chase their dreams without restriction.</p><p>Shime, sensing the shift in Taiga’s mood, quickly changes the subject. “Well, I should get going — got a class to catch at the university. Thanks again, Coach. Taiga-senpai, great match today, let’s do it again soon, yeah?" He gives a quick wave and hurries off, his slender frame disappearing through the lobby doors.</p><p>And then it’s just Taiga and Jin, an awkward silence hanging between them.</p><p>Jin clears his throat, his gaze sympathetic as he takes in Taiga’s clenched jaw and downcast eyes. “Listen, Taiga,” he begins, his voice low and earnest, “I know it’s tough, watching Shime and the others go off to play pro while you're stuck here. But I haven’t given up on convincing your parents to let you play, even just one tournament. You’re too talented to be held back like this.”</p><p>Taiga sighs, a heavy, world-weary sound that seems out of place coming from a 21-year-old. “Thanks, Jin, but I’ve pretty much resigned myself to the fact that it’s not going to happen until after graduation. They’re not budging, and I can’t afford to go against their wishes when they’re the ones funding my training and expenses.”</p><p>It’s a hard truth, but one that Taiga has had to accept. His parents, while supportive of his tennis ambitions to a point, are adamant that he prioritize his education and earn his degree before pursuing a professional career. They see it as a safety net, a fallback plan in case tennis doesn’t work out.</p><p>Taiga, however, sees it as a shackle, holding him back from his true calling.</p><p>Jin nods, his expression a mix of understanding and frustration. “I get it, I do. But don’t lose hope just yet. I’ll keep working on them, see if I can’t get them to come around. In the meantime, just keep focusing on your game, stay sharp. Your time will come, Taiga, I know it will.”</p><p>Taiga musters a grateful smile, though it doesn't quite reach his eyes. “Thanks, Jin. I appreciate you going to bat for me. It means a lot.”</p><p>Jin claps him on the shoulder, a brief but comforting gesture. “Anytime, kid. Now, what do you say I give you a ride to Waseda? Can’t have you being late for your first class of the term.”</p><p>Taiga nods, shouldering his tennis bag as they head out to the parking lot.</p><p>The drive to the university is mostly quiet, Taiga lost in thought as he stares out the window at the cherry blossom-lined streets. The beauty of the scene is lost on him, his mind too consumed with the injustice of his situation and the aching desire to be out there on the court, proving himself against the best in the world.</p><p>All too soon, they’re pulling up to the Waseda campus, the sprawling grounds already bustling with students hurrying to their morning classes. Taiga thanks Jin for the ride and makes his way toward the lecture hall, his steps heavy with resignation.</p><p>As he settles into his seat and pulls out his notebook, Taiga tries to push thoughts of tennis and his thwarted ambitions aside. He knows he needs to focus on his studies, to do well in his classes and maintain his scholarship.</p><p>But it’s hard, when his heart is so clearly elsewhere, yearning for the thrill of competition and the rush of victory.</p><p>The professor begins to speak, and Taiga forces himself to tune in, scribbling notes and trying to absorb the information being presented. But even as he goes through the motions of being a diligent student, his mind can’t help but wander back to the court, to the feel of a racket in his hand and the satisfying thwack of a well-struck ball.</p><p>He thinks of Shime, jetting off to Romania to compete against some of the top players in the world. He thinks of the other up-and-coming stars on the pro circuit, young men his age or even younger who are already making a name for themselves, living the life he so desperately craves.</p><p>And he thinks of his own game, the countless hours he’s spent honing his skills, perfecting his technique. The way his body moves on the court, all lightning-quick reflexes and fluid grace. The exhilaration of outmaneuvering an opponent, of seizing control of a match and refusing to let go.</p><p>Tennis is more than just a sport to Taiga — it’s a calling, a purpose. It’s the one thing in his life that makes him feel truly alive, truly himself.</p><p>And yet, here he is, stuck in a lecture hall, his dreams on hold indefinitely while the world of professional tennis spins on without him.</p><p>The professor drones on, but Taiga barely hears a word. His mind is a million miles away, lost in visions of grandeur and glory on the court. He knows he should be paying attention, knows that his education is important.</p><p>But at that moment, with the weight of his unfulfilled ambitions pressing down on him, it all feels so terribly, terribly insignificant.</p><p>The lecture ends, and Taiga gathers his things, moving on autopilot to his next class. He goes through the motions of the day, taking notes and participating in discussions, but his heart isn’t in it.</p><p>As the day wears on, Taiga’s frustration and restlessness grow. He finds himself itching to get back on the court, to lose himself in the rhythms and strategies of the game. But he knows he has responsibilities, obligations that he can’t simply shirk.</p><p>It’s a bitter irony, he thinks, that the very thing that brings him the most joy is also the source of his greatest pain and frustration. Tennis is his lifeblood, his reason for being.</p><p>And yet, it’s the one thing that seems perpetually out of his grasp, tantalizingly close but always just beyond his reach.</p><p>The final class of the day ends, and Taiga makes his way out of the lecture hall, his steps heavy. He knows he should head to the library, get a start on the homework and readings that are already piling up.</p><p>But the siren call of the court is too strong to resist.</p><p>Almost without conscious thought, he finds himself making his way to the university’s tennis facilities, his fingers itching to wrap around the familiar grip of his racket. The sun is starting to sink lower in the sky, painting the campus in a warm, golden light, but Taiga barely notices. His focus is solely on the prospect of losing himself in the game, of finding some small measure of solace and release on the court.</p><p>As he approaches the tennis courts, a familiar figure catches his eye.</p><p>Yugo Kochi, the captain of the Waseda University tennis team and one of Taiga’s closest friends.</p><p>Yugo is leaning against the fence surrounding the courts, his dark hair tousled by the light breeze, his intense eyes scanning the players on the other side of the chainlink.</p><p>Taiga picks up his pace, drawn to Yugo’s calm, steady presence like a moth to a flame. As he draws closer, Yugo turns, a warm smile spreading across his face as he spots Taiga.</p><p>“Hey!” Yugo calls out, his voice carrying easily across the short distance between them. “Fancy seeing you here. Thought you’d be buried in the library by now.”</p><p>Taiga shrugs, a rueful grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yeah, well, you know me — can’t stay away from the court for too long. It’s like an addiction.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, nodding in understanding. “Nothing quite like the feeling of a racket in your hand, is there? Speaking of which …” He trails off, his eyes glinting with a playful challenge. “You up for a game? Might as well make the most of the facilities before it gets busy with tryouts tomorrow.”</p><p>Taiga’s heart leaps at the prospect, his earlier weariness and frustration melting away in the face of Yugo’s invitation. “Hell yes,” he replies, already reaching for his tennis bag. “Let me just get changed real quick and I’ll meet you on the court.”</p><p>Yugo grins, clapping Taiga on the shoulder as he moves past him toward the clubhouse. “Sounds good. Don’t keep me waiting too long, yeah?”</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, a genuine smile spreading across his face for the first time that day. “Wouldn’t dream of it, cap.”</p><p>He makes his way into the clubhouse, the familiar scents of sweat and rubber washing over him as he enters. The space is empty, most of the team still in classes or off enjoying the pleasant spring weather. Taiga relishes the solitude, taking his time as he changes into his tennis gear, the ritual of it soothing in its familiarity.</p><p>As he pulls on his court shoes and grabs his racquet, Taiga feels a sense of calm settle over him, the worries and frustrations of the day fading into the background. This is where he belongs, he thinks — on the court, with the game thrumming through his veins and the thrill of competition singing in his blood.</p><p>He emerges from the clubhouse to find Yugo already on the court, bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet as he warms up. Taiga takes a moment to admire his friend’s form, the easy grace with which he moves. Yugo may not have Taiga’s raw talent or lightning-quick reflexes, but he more than makes up for it with his strategic mind and unshakeable focus.</p><p>Taiga joins Yugo on the court, the two of them falling into an easy rhythm as they hit a few practice shots back and forth. The sun is warm on Taiga’s back, the breeze ruffling his hair as he moves, and for a moment, he allows himself to forget about everything else — the pressures of school, the weight of his unfulfilled dreams, the constant ache of longing in his chest.</p><p>Right now, there is only this — the satisfying thwack of the ball against his strings, the burn of exertion in his muscles, the pure, uncomplicated joy of the game. Taiga loses himself in it, his mind narrowing to the simple geometry of the court, the instinctive calculations of angle and velocity and spin.</p><p>He and Yugo play for an hour, trading points and friendly trash talk as they push each other to new heights. Yugo’s playing style is a perfect foil to Taiga’s — where Taiga is all aggression and risk-taking, Yugo is steady and consistent, relying on his precision and endurance to wear down his opponents.</p><p>It’s a contrast that serves them well in doubles, their strengths complementing each other in a way that makes them formidable on the court. But in singles, it’s a different story — a battle of wills and strategies, each trying to outmaneuver and outlast the other.</p><p>In the end, it’s Taiga who emerges victorious, his final shot — a blistering forehand down the line — leaving Yugo sprawled on the court, his racket clattering to the ground beside him.</p><p>Taiga pumps his fist in triumph, a fierce grin splitting his face as he savors the rush of victory.</p><p>Yugo sits up, shaking his head ruefully as he meets Taiga’s gaze. “Damn, vice-cap,” he pants, his chest heaving with exertion. “You don’t mess around, do you? Remind me never to piss you off.”</p><p>Taiga laughs, reaching down to haul Yugo to his feet. “Aw, come on, Yugo — you know you love the challenge. Besides, got to keep you on your toes, right?”</p><p>Yugo snorts, dusting himself off as they make their way to the bench at the side of the court. “Yeah, yeah, rub it in, why don’t you? Just wait until next time — I’ll get you back for that.”</p><p>They collapse onto the bench, their bodies loose and languid with the pleasant ache of a hard-fought match. Yugo reaches into his bag and pulls out two sports drinks, tossing one to Taiga before cracking open his own.</p><p>They sit in companionable silence for a few minutes, sipping their drinks and catching their breath as the last of the day’s warmth fades from the sky. Taiga feels a sense of deep contentment settle over him, the worries and frustrations of earlier seeming distant and unimportant in the face of this simple, perfect moment.</p><p>Eventually, Yugo breaks the silence, turning to look at Taiga with a serious expression. “Hey, listen,” he begins, his voice low and earnest. “I know things are tough for you right now, with your parents holding you back from going pro and all. But I just want you to know — I’ve got your back, okay? We all do, the whole team. You’re our vice-cap, our ace. We believe in you, Taiga.”</p><p>Taiga swallows hard. He knows his friend means well, knows that he’s trying to offer comfort and support.</p><p>But the reminder of his situation, of the dreams that seem forever out of reach, is like a knife twisting in his gut.</p><p>He forces a smile, nodding stiffly as he meets Yugo’s gaze. “Thanks, Yugo,” he manages, his voice rough with suppressed feeling. “That … that means a lot.”</p><p>Yugo claps him on the shoulder, his grip firm and reassuring. “Anytime, Taiga. Anytime. Now, what do you say we hit the showers? I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to feel like a walking sweat stain.”</p><p>Taiga huffs a laugh, grateful for the change of subject. “Yeah, sounds good.”</p><p>They gather their things and head back to the clubhouse. In the locker room, they strip off their sweat-soaked clothes and step into the showers, the hot water soothing their aching muscles and washing away the grime of the day.</p><p>As they towel off and change back into their street clothes, Yugo turns to Taiga, a mischievous glint in his eye. “So,” he drawls, his tone deceptively casual. “You ready for tryouts tomorrow? Coach Aiba sent me the list of applicants earlier — looks like we’ve got some promising fresh blood coming in.”</p><p>Taiga groans, the prospect of dealing with a bunch of wide-eyed, overeager first-years filling him with a sense of dread. “Don’t remind me,” he grumbles, pulling on his shirt with a bit more force than necessary. “I swear, if I have to deal with one more starry-eyed kid who thinks they’re the next big thing in tennis, I’m going to lose it.”</p><p>Yugo chuckles, shaking his head at Taiga’s grumpiness. “Aw, come on, vice-cap — where’s your sense of team spirit? These kids are the future of Waseda tennis! We have to nurture their talent, help them grow and develop.”</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes, but he can't quite suppress the smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yeah, yeah, I know. But do we have to do it with quite so much … enthusiasm? I mean, remember last year? I thought Shizu was going to have a stroke, he was so excited.”</p><p>Yugo winces at the memory, a rueful grin spreading across his face. “Okay, fair point. But hey, at least he channeled all that energy into his game, right? Kid’s got a wicked serve now.”</p><p>Taiga has to concede the point — Shizu, for all his overexcitement, has indeed become a valuable member of the team.</p><p>Still, the thought of dealing with a whole new batch of eager, untested players is enough to make him want to crawl back into bed and hide under the covers.</p><p>Yugo, perhaps sensing Taiga’s reluctance, slings an arm around his shoulders, giving him a friendly shake. “Hey, don’t worry, — I’ll be right there with you, every step of the way. We’re in this together, remember?”</p><p>Taiga leans into the touch, feeling some of the tension drain out of his body at the reassurance. “Yeah, I know,” he sighs, running a hand through his damp hair. “Thanks, Yugo. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</p><p>Yugo grins, giving Taiga a final squeeze before releasing him. “Crash and burn, probably,” he teases, dodging the half-hearted swat Taiga aims at his head. His expression turns serious as they step out into the gathering dusk. “Anyway,” he says, his voice low and intent. “There’s something else I wanted to talk to you about, Taiga. Something important.”</p><p>Taiga feels a flicker of unease at Yugo’s tone, his stomach clenching with sudden nerves. “What is it? Something wrong?”</p><p>Yugo shakes his head, but the furrow between his brows doesn’t ease. “Not wrong, exactly, but … well, it’s about your training, Taiga. Or rather, the way you’ve been training the team.”</p><p>Taiga stiffens, his hackles rising at the implied criticism. “What about it?” he asks, his voice coming out sharper than he intended. “You got a problem with the way I run practice?”</p><p>Yugo holds up his hands in a placating gesture, his expression pained. “Easy — I’m not trying to start a fight here. It’s just … well, some of the guys have been talking, and they’re a little … concerned, I guess you could say.”</p><p>Taiga narrows his eyes, his hands clenching into fists at his sides. “Concerned about what, exactly?”</p><p>Yugo sighs, running a hand through his hair in a gesture of frustration. “About the intensity, Taiga. The pressure. I know you’re just trying to push them to be their best, but … well, some of them feel like you’re pushing too hard. Like you’re expecting too much, too fast.”</p><p>Taiga feels a surge of defensive anger rise up in his chest, hot and bitter on the back of his tongue. “Too hard?” he scoffs, shaking his head in disbelief. “Yugo, this is tennis, not a goddamn knitting circle. If they can’t handle a little pressure, then maybe they don’t belong on this team.”</p><p>Yugo flinches at the harshness of Taiga’s words, but he doesn’t back down. “Taiga, come on — you know that’s not fair. These guys are here because they love the game, just like you do. But not everyone is aiming for the pros, you know? For most of them, this is just a hobby, a way to blow off steam and have some fun.”</p><p>Taiga feels his anger drain away as quickly as it had come, leaving behind a hollow sense of exhaustion. He knows Yugo is right, knows that he's been pushing the team too hard, expecting too much.</p><p>But the thought of easing up, of letting go of his own impossible standards... it feels like a betrayal, somehow. A betrayal of his own dreams, his own ambitions.</p><p>“I know,” he says at last, his voice low and defeated. “I know I’ve been riding them too hard. It’s just … it’s hard for me, you know? To see them slacking off, not taking it seriously. When I know how much work it takes, how much sacrifice …”</p><p>He trails off, swallowing hard against the sudden lump in his throat.</p><p>Yugo’s expression softens, his eyes full of sympathy and understanding. “I get it, Taiga,” he says gently, reaching out to squeeze Taiga’s shoulder. “I really do. But you have to remember — not everyone is like you. Not everyone has your drive, your talent. And that's okay. It doesn’t make them any less valuable to the team.”</p><p>Taiga nods. “You’re right,” he manages. “I’m sorry, cap. I’ll try to ease up, I promise. It’s just … it’s hard, you know? Knowing that this is all I have, all I’ll <em>ever</em> have …”</p><p>Yugo’s grip tightens on his shoulder, his eyes fierce and determined. “Hey, don’t talk like that,” he says firmly. “This isn’t the end, Taiga. You’ve still got time, still got a chance to make your dreams come true. And until then … you’ve got us, okay? Your team, your friends. We’re here for you, no matter what.”</p><p>Taiga feels a rush of gratitude at Yugo’s words. He knows he doesn’t deserve it, knows that he’s been selfish and single-minded in his pursuit of his own goals. But in that moment, Taiga feels a flicker of hope rekindling in his chest.</p><p>“Thanks, cap,” he says softly, managing a shaky smile.</p><p>Yugo grins, giving Taiga’s shoulder a final squeeze before releasing him. “Always, vice-cap. Always. Now, what do you say we get out of here? I don’t know about you, but I’m starving.”</p><p>Taiga nods, feeling some of the weight lift from his shoulders as they fall into step beside each other. “Yeah, sounds good.”</p><p>As they head toward the university gates, Taiga allows himself a moment to breathe, to savor the simple pleasure of walking beside his friend in the cool evening air. The campus is quiet now, most of the students having long since retreated to their dorms or headed out for the night.</p><p>Taiga knows he should be doing the same — he has homework to tackle, strategies to plan for tomorrow's tryouts.</p><p>But for now, he’s content to let it all fade into the background, to exist in this moment.</p>

<p align="center">🎾</p><p>The scent of freshly cut grass and the rhythmic thwack of tennis balls fill the air as Jesse arrives at the private tennis facility, a canvas duffle bag slung over his shoulder. The sun warms his skin as he steps onto the well-maintained courts, breathing in the familiar aroma of new tennis balls. Cherry blossom petals flutter in the gentle breeze, their soft pink hues a picturesque contrast against the vivid green of the court. </p><p>Jesse begins his warm-up routine, starting with some dynamic stretches to loosen up his muscles. As he reaches down to touch his toes, he notices his best friend Meme strolling into the facility, flashing a charming smile at a group of ladies who pass by.</p><p>He chuckles to himself, amused by his friend’s effortless charisma. “Hey, Meme!” he calls out, waving him over. “Glad you could make it.”</p><p>Meme grins, setting his own tennis bag down and starting his warm-up exercises. “Wouldn’t miss our practice game for the world, man. Besides, I’ve got to make sure you're ready for your big tryout.”</p><p>Jesse laughs, shaking his head. “I think I’ll manage. Though, it’s a good thing you don’t play mixed doubles. Those girls would’ve been swooning over you by now.”</p><p>Meme raises an eyebrow, a playful smirk on his lips. “I don’t know, Jesse. You’re not looking too bad yourself these days. Seems like you've finally outgrown that awkward teenage phase.”</p><p>Jesse rolls his eyes, but a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. It’s true that he’s come a long way from his gangly, self-conscious teenage years. He’s grown taller, lean muscles defining his arms and shoulders from years of tennis practice. His blonde hair, once an unruly mop, is now styled with a slight tousle that frames his gentle features nicely.</p><p>“Alright, enough chit-chat,” he says, grabbing his racket. “Let’s see if you can keep up with me today, Meme.”</p><p>Meme grins, picking up his own racket and spinning it deftly in his hand. “Oh, it’s on.”</p><p>They take their positions on opposite sides of the net, the sun now high in the sky, casting short shadows on the court. Jesse bounces the ball a few times, feeling the familiar texture of the fuzzy, neon-green sphere against his palm. He takes a deep breath, tossing the ball high into the air and arching his back, racket poised to strike.</p><p>The ball seems to hang suspended for a moment before Jesse’s racket connects with a satisfying thwack, sending it hurtling across the net toward Meme.</p><p>Meme, ever the quick reactor, lunges to his right, his racket meeting the ball with a resounding crack. The ball rockets back towards Jesse, skimming the top of the net before dropping sharply onto his side of the court.</p><p>Jesse dashes forward, sliding into a low forehand stroke that sends the ball whizzing down the line past Meme’s outstretched racket.</p><p>“15-love,” he calls out, a grin spreading across his face.</p><p>Meme shakes his head, chuckling. “Not bad, Jesse. But don’t get too cocky. We’re just getting started.”</p><p>The match continues, each player showcasing their unique strengths and styles. Jesse’s game is marked by creativity and adaptability, his shots often catching Meme off guard with their unpredictable trajectories and spin. He moves around the court with a relaxed, almost languid grace, but there’s no mistaking the power behind his strokes when he needs it.</p><p>Meme, on the other hand, relies on his lightning-fast reflexes and precise shot placement to keep Jesse on his toes. His movements are sharp and efficient, wasting no energy as he glides across the court, always seeming to be in the right place at the right time. His serves are particularly formidable, rocketing over the net with a speed and spin that make them nearly impossible to return.</p><p>As they trade shots back and forth, their banter continues, punctuated by laughter and good-natured ribbing.</p><p>“Come on, Meme, is that the best you’ve got?” Jesse taunts as he lobs a ball high over Meme’s head, forcing him to scramble back to the baseline.</p><p>Meme grunts as he stretches to reach the ball, barely managing to get his racket on it. The ball floats back over the net, and Jesse is there to meet it, smashing an overhead winner into the corner of the court.</p><p>“30-15,” Jesse calls out, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The sun is beating down on them now, and he can feel his shirt beginning to stick to his back.</p><p>Meme takes a moment to catch his breath, hands on his knees. “You’re in rare form today, Jesse. Been practicing in secret?”</p><p>Jesse shrugs, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Maybe I’m just saving my best moves for Nationals. Wouldn’t want to give away all my secrets too soon.”</p><p>The match wears on, each game a hard-fought battle of wills and skill. Jesse can feel his muscles beginning to tire, his lungs burning with each breath, but he pushes through, determined to prove himself.</p><p>In the end, it’s a close match, but Jesse emerges victorious, collapsing onto the court in exhaustion and elation.</p><p>Meme walks over to him, extending a hand to help him up. “Well played, Jesse. You really gave me a run for my money out there.”</p><p>Jesse grins, clasping Meme’s hand and pulling himself to his feet. “Thanks, man. You didn’t make it easy on me, that’s for sure.”</p><p>They gather their gear and head off the court towards the locker rooms, the adrenaline of the match still thrumming through their veins. The cool air of the changing room is a welcome relief after the heat of the sun, and they take their time showering and changing into fresh clothes.</p><p>“So, where to now?” Meme asks as they exit the facility, squinting in the bright afternoon light. “I’m starving after that workout.”</p><p>Jesse nods in agreement, his stomach rumbling at the mention of food. “There’s a great little restaurant just down the street. My treat, since you were kind enough to let me win today.”</p><p>Meme laughs, punching Jesse lightly on the shoulder. “Oh, so that’s how it is? I see how it is.”</p><p>They stroll down the tree-lined street, cherry blossom petals swirling around their feet in the gentle breeze. The restaurant is a cozy, hole-in-the-wall place, with mismatched chairs and tables crammed into a narrow space. The air is thick with the aroma of grilling meat and simmering soups, and Jesse’s mouth waters in anticipation.</p><p>They take a seat at a small table by the window, the sun slanting through the glass and painting everything in a warm, golden light. A waitress approaches, her eyes widening slightly as she takes in Meme’s handsome features.</p><p>Jesse suppresses a grin, watching as his friend turns on the charm, complimenting the waitress on her smile and asking for her recommendations.</p><p>In the end, they both order hearty bowls of ramen, the steaming broth and tender noodles a perfect post-match meal.</p><p>As they slurp away, Meme looks up at Jesse, a serious expression on his face. “So, Jesse, I’ve been meaning to ask you something.”</p><p>Jesse pauses, a noodle dangling from his chopsticks. “Yeah, what’s up?”</p><p>Meme sets down his bowl, leaning forward slightly. “Why aren’t you planning to go pro? I mean, you’ve got the talent, the drive. You could really make a name for yourself out there.”</p><p>Jesse sighs, setting down his own chopsticks. It’s a question he’s been asked many times before, by coaches, teammates, even his own parents. But the answer is always the same.</p><p>“I just want to have fun, Meme. I love tennis, but I don’t want it to become a job, you know? The pro circuit … it just seems like it takes all the joy out of the game.”</p><p>Meme nods slowly, understanding dawning on his face. “I get it, man. It’s a lot of pressure, a lot of expectations. But still, you could have at least gave Junior Nationals a shot. You could’ve showed everyone what you’re made of.”</p><p>Jesse chuckles, shaking his head. “You’ve been trying to convince me to compete in Junior Nationals for years, Meme. But I’m happy where I am. Besides, I’m trying out for the Waseda team. That’s enough competition for me.”</p><p>Meme leans back in his chair, a sly grin spreading across his face. “Ah, yes. The Waseda team. And I’m sure a certain someone has nothing to do with that decision, right?”</p><p>Jesse feels his cheeks heating up, and he quickly takes a sip of water to hide his embarrassment. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Meme laughs, wagging a finger at Jesse. “Oh, come on. You’ve had a crush on Kyomoto Taiga since we were kids. Don’t even try to deny it.”</p><p>Jesse sputters, nearly choking on his water. “It’s not a crush!” he protests, but he knows his face is giving him away. “I just … I’ve always admired him, ever since we were kids. He’s an incredible player.”</p><p>Meme nods, his expression softening. “I remember that match you played against him in Junior Nationals. He won easily, but you put up a good fight.”</p><p>Jesse smiles at the memory, bittersweet though it is. He had been so nervous that day, standing across the net from his idol. Taiga had been gracious in victory, shaking Jesse’s hand and offering words of encouragement.</p><p>Since then, Jesse had followed Taiga’s career with rapt attention, marveling at his skill and poise on the court.</p><p>“I was surprised when he didn’t go pro,” Jesse admits, twirling his straw in his drink. “But when I heard he was playing for Waseda, I knew I had to try out for the team. I worked so hard to get accepted to the university, and now … now I have a chance to play alongside him.”</p><p>Meme reaches across the table, clapping Jesse on the shoulder. “Well, here’s your chance to get close to your crush,” he teases, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “Just promise me one thing.”</p><p>Jesse raises an eyebrow, curious. “What’s that?”</p><p>Meme leans back, folding his arms across his chest. “Promise me that we’ll face each other in Nationals. I’m already a shoo-in for the Keio team, and I want to see you on the other side of the net.”</p><p>Jesse grins, feeling a thrill of excitement at the prospect. “You’ve got a deal, Meme. But first, I have to make it through these tryouts.”</p><p>Meme glances at his watch, his eyes widening. “Speaking of which, we should probably get going. You don’t want to be late.”</p><p>They pay for their meal, Jesse insisting on splitting the bill despite Meme’s protests.</p><p>As they step out into the bright afternoon sun, Meme jingles his car keys in his hand. “I can give you a ride to campus,” he offers, knowing that Jesse doesn’t drive. “But seriously, Jesse, you need to get your license. You can’t rely on me forever.”</p><p>Jesse laughs, punching Meme lightly on the arm. “I know, I know. I’ll get around to it eventually. But for now, I’ll take you up on that ride.”</p><p>They climb into Meme’s car, the engine rumbling to life. As they navigate the busy streets of Tokyo, Jesse feels a sense of calm settle over him.</p><p>He’s ready for this, ready to take on the challenge of the tryouts and prove himself worthy of a spot on the Waseda team.</p><p>The campus comes into view, its sprawling grounds dotted with cherry blossom trees in full bloom. Meme pulls up to the curb, giving Jesse a final thumbs-up.</p><p>“Go get ‘em, Jesse,” he says, his voice filled with confidence. “Show them what you're made of.”</p><p>Jesse nods, his jaw set with determination. He steps out of the car, his tennis bag slung over his shoulder.</p><p>With a final wave to Meme, he turns and strides towards the tennis courts, ready to face whatever comes his way.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎾</p><p>As Jesse approaches the university tennis courts, he sees a crowd of eager applicants already forming, their chatter and laughter filling the air. The cherry blossom trees lining the pathway sway gently in the breeze, their delicate petals drifting lazily to the ground.</p><p>Jesse takes a deep breath, inhaling the sweet fragrance of spring mingled with the distinct scent of freshly opened tennis balls.</p><p>He’s about to head towards the registration booth when a friendly voice calls out to him. “Hey, man! Just a heads up, your shoelaces are untied.”</p><p>Jesse glances down, realizing that the stranger is right. He quickly bends down to tie his laces, a slight flush of embarrassment coloring his cheeks. “Thanks for letting me know,” he says, straightening up to face the guy who had spoken to him.</p><p>The young man grins, his dark eyes sparkling with warmth. “No problem! Can’t have you tripping over your own feet during the tryouts, right? I’m Morimoto Shintaro, by the way. First-year, just like you, I’m guessing.”</p><p>Jesse returns the smile, instantly drawn to Shintaro’s easygoing nature. “Lewis Jesse,” he introduces himself, shaking Shintaro’s outstretched hand. “But I go by Jesse. And yeah, I’m a freshman too. Majoring in human sciences.”</p><p>“Science education for me,” Shintaro replies, falling into step beside Jesse as they make their way toward the registration booth. “I’ve been looking forward to these tryouts for weeks. The Waseda team is legendary.”</p><p>Jesse nods in agreement, his heart rate picking up at the mention of the team. “They really are. And with Kyomoto Taiga as vice-captain this year, they’re bound to be even stronger.”</p><p>Shintaro raises an eyebrow, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. “Ah, so you’re a Kyomoto fan, huh? Can’t say I blame you. The guy’s a machine on the court.”</p><p>Jesse feels his face heating up, but he can’t help the grin that spreads across his features. “Yeah, I’ve been following his career for years. He's the reason I worked so hard to get into Waseda, actually.”</p><p>Shintaro claps him on the back, his laughter ringing out across the courts. “Well, here’s your chance to impress him, then! Let’s go sign up and show these guys what we’re made of.”</p><p>They approach the registration booth, where a slender, delicate-looking man is handing out name tags to the applicants. He looks up as Jesse and Shintaro reach the front of the line, a warm smile lighting up his face.</p><p>“Welcome, gentlemen,” he greets them, his voice soft and melodic. “I’m Matsumura Hokuto, a second-year and current member of the tennis team. If you’ll just fill out these forms and attach your name tags, you can join the others on the benches over there.”</p><p>As he hands them their tags and points out the waiting area, Hokuto’s gaze lingers on Shintaro for a moment, a faint blush coloring his cheeks.</p><p>“I do hope you’ll both make the team,” he adds, a playful glint in his eye. “We could always use some fresh talent. And who knows, maybe one of you will even become my doubles partner this season.”</p><p>Shintaro’s eyes widen, and he nearly drops his pen in his haste to fill out the form. “I’ll do my best, Matsumura-senpai,” he promises, his voice uncharacteristically earnest. “I won’t let you down.”</p><p>Jesse hides a grin as they make their way over to the benches, amused by Shintaro’s sudden enthusiasm. “Looks like you’ve got a crush, Morimoto,” he teases, elbowing his new friend gently in the ribs.</p><p>Shintaro flushes, but he can’t seem to wipe the silly smile off his face. “What can I say? I’m a sucker for pretty boys with tennis skills. And if it means I get to be Matsumura-senpai’s doubles partner, I’ll do whatever it takes to make this team.”</p><p>They take their seats among the other hopefuls, the excitement in the air palpable. Jesse bounces his leg nervously, his eyes scanning the courts for any sign of Taiga. He knows he should be focusing on his own performance, but he can’t help the way his heart leaps at the thought of seeing his idol in person again.</p><p>Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Coach Aiba Masaki strides onto the court, flanked by Kochi Yugo, the captain, and Taiga. Jesse sits up straighter, his breath catching in his throat as he takes in the sight of Taiga in his tennis whites, his dark hair gleaming in the sunlight.</p><p>Coach Aiba claps his hands, calling for attention. “Good afternoon, everyone,” he greets them, his voice carrying easily across the courts. “I’m Coach Aiba Masaki, and I’d like to welcome you all to the Waseda University tennis team tryouts. As you know, we have a proud tradition of excellence here, and we’re always on the lookout for new talent to help us maintain that reputation.”</p><p>He gestures to the two young men standing beside him. “I’m sure you all recognize Kochi Yugo, our captain, and Kyomoto Taiga, our vice-captain. They’ll be assisting me in evaluating your skills today, so make sure to give it your all out there.”</p><p>Jesse barely hears the rest of Coach Aiba’s speech, too busy drinking in every detail of Taiga’s appearance. He looks just as Jesse remembers him from their last encounter seven years ago, his features still delicate and almost feminine, but with a new air of confidence and authority about him.</p><p>He wonders if Taiga even remembers that match, the one that had cemented Jesse’s admiration for him. He had been so nervous that day, facing off against the rising star of the junior tennis world.</p><p>Taiga had beaten him easily, of course, but he had been kind in his victory, offering Jesse words of encouragement and praise for his efforts.</p><p>Jesse is jolted back to the present by Shintaro’s elbow digging into his side. “Earth to Jesse,” his friend whispers, a note of amusement in his voice. “It’s time to start warming up. You can stare at Kyomoto later.”</p><p>Jesse flushes, but he nods, rising to his feet and grabbing his racket. He takes a deep breath, trying to center himself and focus on the task at hand. He knows he has the skills to make this team, but he also knows that he’ll be up against some tough competition.</p><p>As he goes through his warm-up routine, he can’t help but glance over at Taiga every now and then, watching as he confers with Yugo and Coach Aiba, a serious expression on his face. Taiga seems to be taking his role as vice-captain very seriously, his eyes intent as he studies the other applicants, jotting down notes on a clipboard.</p><p>Jesse feels a thrill of nerves and excitement as he steps onto the court for his first drill, determined to give it his all. He loses himself in the familiar rhythm of the game, his body moving on instinct as he chases down balls and fires off shots.</p><p>He can hear Shintaro cheering him on from the sidelines, his voice rising above the din of the other applicants. It spurs Jesse on, pushing him to dig deeper and give even more of himself to the game he loves so much.</p><p>By the time the tryouts are over, Jesse is drenched in sweat and breathing hard, but he feels a sense of satisfaction and pride in his performance. He knows he gave it everything he had, leaving it all out on the court.</p><p>He joins the other applicants as they gather around Coach Aiba, waiting anxiously for the results. Yugo steps forward, a smile on his face as he begins to read out the names of those who made the cut.</p><p>“...and finally, Lewis Jesse and Morimoto Shintaro,” he finishes, his eyes twinkling as he looks over at them. “Congratulations, gentlemen. Welcome to the Waseda tennis team.”</p><p>Jesse feels a rush of elation, his heart soaring as he exchanges high-fives with Shintaro and the other successful applicants. He can’t believe he actually did it, that he’s one step closer to his dream of playing alongside Taiga.</p><p>But Taiga himself steps forward then, his expression serious. “Don’t get too comfortable just yet,” he warns, his voice quiet but firm. “You may have made the team, but you’re still just rookies. You’ll have to prove yourselves in the coming weeks if you want to earn a spot on the starting lineup.”</p><p>Jesse nods, his jaw set with determination. He knows Taiga is right, that making the team is only the beginning. He’ll have to work harder than ever to show that he belongs here, that he has what it takes to compete at this level.</p><p>As the other new members start to disperse, chatting excitedly amongst themselves, Jesse takes a deep breath and approaches Taiga, his heart pounding in his chest.</p><p>“Excuse me, Kyomoto-senpai,” he says, bowing slightly in respect. “I just wanted to say that I’m a huge fan of yours. I’ve been following your career for years, and it’s an honor to be on the same team as you.”</p><p>Taiga regards him coolly, his expression unreadable. “Thank you, Lewis,” he replies, his tone polite but distant. “I appreciate your support.”</p><p>Jesse hesitates, then plunges ahead, his voice eager. “Actually, we’ve met before. At the Junior Nationals, back in 2011. You probably don’t remember, but...”</p><p>“I'm sorry, I don't recall,” Taiga interrupts, his voice firm. “If you’ll excuse me, I have some things to discuss with Coach Aiba.”</p><p>He turns and walks away, leaving Jesse standing there, his heart sinking.</p><p>He had hoped that Taiga might remember him, might see something special in him. But it seems that to Taiga, he’s just another rookie, another face in the crowd.</p><p>Shintaro appears at his side, clapping him on the shoulder. “Tough break, man,” he says sympathetically. “But hey, don’t let it get you down. You’ll have plenty of chances to impress him in practice.”</p><p>Jesse nods, forcing a smile. “You're right. I just have to keep working hard and proving myself. Kyomoto-senpai will notice me eventually.”</p><p>As they gather their things and head off the court, Jesse can't help but glance back at Taiga one last time. He looks so cool and collected, so focused and driven. Jesse knows he has a long way to go before he can measure up to his idol.</p><p>But he also knows that he’s not going to give up. He’s going to do whatever it takes to earn Taiga’s respect and attention, to show him that he's a force to be reckoned with on the court.</p><p>With a determined set to his jaw, Jesse follows Shintaro out of the tennis complex. He may be just a rookie now, but he has big dreams and the drive to make them happen.</p><p>And one day, he knows, Kyomoto Taiga will look at him and see not just another teammate, but a true rival and equal.</p><p>Jesse will make sure of it.</p><p>The sun is starting to set as they make their way back to the dorms, the sky painted in shades of orange and pink. Jesse breathes in the cool evening air, feeling a sense of contentment and excitement washing over him.</p><p>He's taken the first step on his journey to becoming a true tennis star, and he knows there will be plenty of challenges and obstacles ahead. But with his newfound friends by his side and his unwavering determination, he feels ready to face anything.</p><p>As he parts ways with Shintaro and heads to his own room, Jesse's mind is already racing with ideas for how he can improve his game, how he can make himself stand out on the court. He knows he'll have to put in long hours of practice, pushing himself to his limits and beyond.</p><p>But he also knows that it will all be worth it in the end, when he's standing across the net from Taiga, their eyes locked in a battle of wills and skill. He can almost feel the thrill of it, the rush of adrenaline and the satisfaction of knowing that he's given his all.</p><p>Jesse flops down on his bed, his muscles aching in the best possible way. He stares up at the ceiling, a smile playing on his lips as he replays the day's events in his mind.</p><p>He knows there will be setbacks and disappointments along the way, moments when he'll question himself and his abilities. But he also knows that he has the strength and the passion to overcome them, to keep pushing forward no matter what.</p><p>Because this is his dream, his calling. And he's going to chase it with everything he has, no matter how long it takes or how hard he has to work.</p><p>With that thought in mind, Jesse closes his eyes, letting the exhaustion of the day wash over him. Tomorrow will bring new challenges and new opportunities, but for now, he's content to bask in the glow of his accomplishment, the knowledge that he's one step closer to his ultimate goal.</p><p>As he drifts off to sleep, the image of Taiga's face swims before his eyes, that cool, unreadable expression that Jesse is determined to crack. He knows it won't be easy, but he's never been one to back down from a challenge.</p><p>And so, with a smile on his face and a fire in his heart, Jesse surrenders to his dreams, ready to face whatever the future may bring. He's a Waseda tennis player now, and he's going to make sure the world knows his name.</p>
