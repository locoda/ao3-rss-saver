<div class="userstuff">
<p>The August sun beats down mercilessly as Taiga steps out of the car, the humid air already clinging to his skin. Beads of sweat form on his brow, but he barely notices, his mind focused solely on the day ahead.</p><p>The All-Japan Junior Tennis Tournament — the pinnacle of the junior tennis circuit in Japan. A chance to prove himself, to show the world what Taiga Kyomoto is made of.</p><p>As he walks toward the entrance of the Ariake Tennis Park, he can feel the energy in the air, the excitement and anticipation of the fans, the players, the coaches. It’s electric, and he can’t help but feed off it, his own excitement building with each step.</p><p>“Taiga!” a voice calls out, and he turns to see his coach, Akanishi Jin, jogging to catch up with him. He’s been with Taiga since he first started playing competitively, guiding him, supporting him, pushing him to be the best he can be.</p><p>Taiga owes him a lot.</p><p>“You ready?” Jin asks, falling into step beside him.</p><p>Taiga nods, a small smile playing on his lips. “Always.”</p><p>They make their way through the crowds, the chatter and laughter washing over them. Everywhere Taiga looks, there are people in tennis gear, rackets slung over shoulders, excitement etched on their faces. It’s a familiar sight, one that never fails to ignite a spark inside him.</p><p>As they approach the check-in desk, Taiga catches sight of my reflection in a nearby window. Short, dark brown hair frames his face, his doe eyes staring back at him with a determination that surprises even him. At sixteen, he’s still growing into his features, but there’s a sense of purpose in the set of his jaw, the angle of his chin</p><p>He’s here to win.</p><p>“Taiga Kyomoto, checking in for the second round,” he says to the woman behind the desk, handing over his ID.</p><p>She smiles, tapping away at her keyboard before handing Taiga a badge. “Good luck out there,” she says.</p><p>Taiga nods his thanks.</p><p>He and Jin make their way to the practice courts, the sound of tennis balls being hit growing louder with each step. It’s a familiar rhythm, one that he’s heard countless times before, but it never fails to set his heart racing.</p><p>“Your opponent today is Jesse Lewis,” Jin says as they claim an empty court. “He’s a bit of an unknown, but from what I’ve seen, he’s got a lot of potential.”</p><p>Taiga nods, taking his racket out of his bag and giving it a few experimental swings. “I watched his first-round match yesterday. He’s spontaneous, unpredictable. But he gets distracted easily. If I can keep him on his toes, I should be able to wear him down.”</p><p>Jin nods, a proud smile on his face. “That’s my boy. Always thinking, always strategizing. Just remember, don’t underestimate him. He may be young, but he’s got heart.”</p><p>Taiga nods, taking his coach’s words to heart. He’s seen too many players fall victim to their own arrogance, thinking they had the match in the bag only to be blindsided by an unexpected comeback.</p><p>He won’t make that mistake.</p><p>They spend the next hour practicing, Jin feeding Taiga balls as he works on his footwork, his strokes, his serves. The sun is relentless, the heat oppressive, but he barely notices, lost in the rhythm of the game.</p><p>Finally, it's time.</p><p>Taiga and Jin make their way to the assigned court, the crowds already gathering in the stands. He can feel their eyes on him, hear the whispers of excitement as they recognize him.</p><p>“That’s Taiga Kyomoto,” they murmur. “The prodigy.”</p><p>Taiga tries to block it out, to focus on the task at hand. But there’s a part of him that thrills at the attention, at the knowledge that he’s making a difference, that he’s inspiring others to pick up a racket and give it a try.</p><p>As he steps onto the court, he catches sight of his opponent across the net.</p><p>Jesse Lewis.</p><p>He’s tall and lanky, with a mop of dark brown hair and an easy smile. He looks relaxed, almost excited to be here, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he waits for the match to start.</p><p>“Kyomoto-senpai!” he calls out as Taiga approaches the net for the pre-match handshake. “It’s an honor to play against you. I’ve been a fan since your debut at Junior Nationals three years ago.”</p><p>Taiga can’t help but smile at his opponent’s enthusiasm, even as he reminds himself to stay focused. “Thank you,” he says, shaking Jesse’s hand firmly. “Let’s have a good match.”</p><p>They take their positions, the crowd falling silent as the umpire calls for the start of the match. Taiga bounces the ball a few times, feeling the familiar weight in his hand, the texture of the felt against his palm.</p><p>Then, with a deep breath, he tosses it up and smashes it across the net.</p><p>The match is on.</p><p>From the start, it’s clear that Jesse is a wildcard. His shots are unpredictable, his movements erratic. He’ll hit a blistering forehand one moment, then a soft drop shot the next.</p><p>It’s maddening, trying to anticipate his next move, but Taiga forces himself to stay calm, to read Jesse’s body language, to trust his instincts.</p><p>Taiga takes the first set 6-0, his shots crisp and precise, his footwork flawless.</p><p>But Jesse isn't deterred. He comes back in the second set with a vengeance, his shots even more daring, his energy infectious. The crowd is loving it, cheering him on with every point, and Taiga can feel the momentum shifting.</p><p>But Taiga refuses to let it rattle him. He’s worked too hard, trained too long to let one set throw him off his game.</p><p>He digs deep, tapping into the well of determination that has carried him this far. He starts to mix up his shots, throwing in slices and drop shots to keep Jesse off balance.</p><p>It works, and he claims the second set 7-6.</p><p>By the third set, they’re both drenched in sweat, their lungs burning with exertion. But neither of them is willing to back down.</p><p>Jesse takes an early lead, his shots finding the corners with uncanny accuracy. But Taiga refuses to let him pull away. He fights for every point, chasing down balls that seem impossible to reach, throwing everything he has into every stroke.</p><p>It’s a battle of wills, a test of endurance. The crowd is on their feet, shouting themselves hoarse with every rally.</p><p>And then, finally, Taiga sees his chance.</p><p>Jesse hits a forehand that sails long, and Taiga pounces, smashing a winner down the line to claim the set 7-5.</p><p>The fourth set is a blur, both of them running on fumes but refusing to yield. Every point feels like a mini-war, each of them digging deep for one more shot, one more burst of energy.</p><p>But in the end, it’s Taiga experience that wins out. He reads Jesse’s shots a split second faster, anticipates his moves a heartbeat sooner.</p><p>And with a final, blistering serve, Taiga claims the match 6-4.</p><p>The crowd erupts in cheers as Taiga falls to his knees, his chest heaving with exhaustion and elation. He’s done it. He’s won.</p><p>One step closer to his goal of winning Nationals, of claiming the title that has eluded him for the past three years.</p><p>Taiga looks up to see Jesse standing at the net, his hand outstretched in congratulations. “Great match,” he says, his smile genuine despite the loss. “You really are something special, Taiga Kyomoto.”</p><p>He shakes Jesse’s hand, feeling a rush of respect for this young player who pushed him to his limits. “You’re not so bad yourself,” he says with a grin. “I have a feeling this won’t be the last time we meet on the court.”</p><p>Jesse laughs, his eyes sparkling with excitement. “I sure hope not. I’ve got a lot of catching up to do if I want to beat you next time.”</p><p>They make their way off the court, the adrenaline slowly fading as the reality of the win sinks in. Jin is waiting for Taiga, his face split in a proud grin.</p><p>“Well done, Taiga,” he says, clapping him on the shoulder. “You showed a lot of grit out there today. Keep playing like that, and you’ll be unstoppable.”</p><p>Taiga nods, too exhausted to speak.</p><p>But as he gathers his things and heads for the locker room, he can’t help but feel a sense of exhilaration. He’s one step closer to his dream, one match closer to proving to the world that he has what it takes to be the best.</p><p>But even as he basks in the glow of victory, he can’t shake the feeling that this is just the beginning. Jesse may have been an unknown today, but something tells Taiga he won’t stay that way for long. He’s got a fire in him, a hunger that matches Taiga’s own.</p><p>And Taiga has a feeling that the next time they meet on the court, it’s going to be one hell of a match.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center">🎾</p><p>Taiga bounces lightly on the balls of his feet, racket in hand, as he awaits the serve. Across the net, Shime tosses the ball high and arches back, racket slicing upward in a smooth motion to send the yellow sphere hurtling over the net.</p><p>Taiga springs into action, moving forward to intercept the blistering serve with cat-like reflexes. His racket connects cleanly, pinging the ball back over the net at a sharp angle.</p><p>Shime darts to his right, managing to scrabble the return just over the net. But Taiga is already there, legs coiling as he sets up for a forehand winner down the line. The ball screams off his racquet, kicking up chalk as it hits the corner.</p><p>“Fifteen-love,” calls the umpire in a bored tone.</p><p>Taiga allows himself a small smile as he and Shime switch sides. Just a friendly practice match at their club, yet it feels good to win that first point.</p><p>Especially against Shime, who turned pro last year at eighteen while Taiga remains confined to the college tennis circuit.</p><p>Not that he resents his friend for it. Much.</p><p>Okay, maybe a little. They’re both the only children of wealthy parents, but Shime’s indulge his every tennis whim, while Taiga’s put the kibosh on him joining the pro tour until after university.</p><p>Which he’s now halfway through, itching for the day he can test himself against the best players in the world.</p><p>For now, he has to settle for dominating college competition.</p><p>Shime serves again, but this time Taiga reads it perfectly, absorbing the pace and redirecting it down the line for another clean winner.</p><p>“Thirty-love.”</p><p>Shime shrugs off the point, unfazed as always. Nothing seems to perturb his eternally tranquil demeanor. It’s part of what makes him such a sturdy, reliable player, able to weather opponent storms by sticking to his patient, percentage-first playing style.</p><p>Effective, yes, but a tad boring in Taiga’s opinion. Where’s the fun without a little risk-taking and unpredictability to keep opponents guessing?</p><p>After a long rally on the third point, Taiga draws Shime wide to his forehand side before whistling a backhand pass right by him. Three crisp winners to start this service game. Ideal for settling into the flow of the match.</p><p>“Forty-love.”</p><p>He bounces the ball a few times, readying his body. Takes a breath to cleanse tension as he tosses the ball high. One fluid motion and he hammers an ace down the T, too fast for Shime’s outstretched racket.</p><p>Game to him, one-love.</p><p>And so it continues through the opening set, Taiga pressure-free in his service games while probing Shime for openings in the endless rallies on return. After forty-five minutes of play, the score sits at 5-4 Taiga.</p><p>One game from taking the first set.</p><p>Shime serves to stay in the set and quickly falls behind love-thirty after a double fault and backhand error. Sensing blood in the water, Taiga ratchets up his focus. He feasts on weakness. A vicious forehand return catches Shime off balance for love-forty, triple set point.</p><p>Though calm on the exterior, Taiga thrums with tightly coiled energy inside. One point from the set. He bounces on the baseline, hungry and alert.</p><p>Shime misses his first serve but puts the second in play. Taiga lets it rip on the backhand return, sprinting forward to cut off Shime’s reply. A perfect drop volley ends the point and the set.</p><p>“Game and first set, Kyomoto. Six games to four.”</p><p>Taiga allows himself a triumphant yell and first pump. He thrives on the pressure and drama of important points. Complete emotional control may work for Shime, but Taiga needs a vent for the nervous energy that builds before critical moments.</p><p>As they take a one-minute breather, he notices a few club members looking on. Despite it being just a practice match, Taiga loves having an audience. It pushes him to showcase his flashy shot-making and competitive zeal.</p><p>The second set opens with Taiga consolidating the break for a 2-0 advantage. But Shime digs in, steadying himself tactically by playing higher percentages and reducing errors. He breaks back for two-all, then holds for a 3-2 lead. His more conservative style frustrates Taiga, who grows impatient trying to force the issue.</p><p>At three games all, Taiga serves to draw even. Up thirty-love, he gets a short ball and goes for a low-percentage drop shot that sails long. His aggressive gambles are misfiring now. A double fault follows, then a dumped volley.</p><p>Suddenly, he’s facing break point at thirty-forty.</p><p>Taiga takes a deep breath, pushes aside negative thoughts. He needs something special to dig out of this hole.</p><p>The next point, Shime thinks he has him pinned in the backhand corner. But with a burst of speed, Taiga sprints for a forehand whip and rifles it down the line for a winner. Back to deuce.</p><p>The audience applauds, making Taiga grin. Time to put on a show.</p><p>On the next point, he slams a 120 mph ace, his fastest of the match. Ad-in.</p><p>One more big serve, and Taiga holds after being down triple break point. 4-4, back on serve.</p><p>Crisis averted.</p><p>That proves the turning point of the set. Taiga settles down and finds his rhythm again. He stops trying to bash Shime off the court and works the angles more, moving his opponent around like a chess piece. His serve and net game also dominate down the stretch.</p><p>After an easy hold at 5-4, Taiga breaks Shime one last time to claim the second set 6-4.</p><p>Handshake at the net, then off to the locker room to towel off and change.</p><p>Taiga luxuriates under the hot shower spray, replaying highlights of the match in his mind. The thrill of a hard-fought victory never gets old, even if today’s was just a casual practice match.</p><p>But his enjoyment is fleeting as unwanted thoughts creep in. If only he could experience more of these moments on the pro tour instead of dominating college players beneath his ability.</p><p>He knows he’s ready to compete at tennis’ highest levels right now. But his parents refuse to fund that dream until after university.</p><p>So while Shime lives the life of his dreams globe-trotting the pro circuit, Taiga remains stuck in his junior year of college, forced to wait nearly two more years until he’s “responsible” enough in his parents’ eyes. He knows they mean well, but their paternalistic rules feel so stifling and unfair.</p><p>Taiga shuts the shower off roughly and dries himself with more force than necessary. Getting worked up over his situation yet again serves no purpose except souring his mood. Better to focus that frustrated energy on bringing a national title to Waseda in his third year.</p><p>With Yugo graduating, the team captaincy will fall fully on Taiga’s shoulders next year. He needs to start leaving his legacy by finally achieving the championship that’s eluded Waseda since the 90s.</p><p>Freshly showered and changed, Taiga exits the locker room feeling re-centered. No surprise that Shime waits by the door, punctual as always. His own shower and change took half the time of Taiga’s.</p><p>“Great match today!” Shime says, smiling. “Your backhand was really firing those last few games. I couldn’t get anything by you.”</p><p>Despite his jealousy, Taiga can’t help but smile back. Shime’s praise never feels patronizing, only earnest and uplifting. He wishes he possessed his friend’s perpetually sunny, glass-half-full mentality.</p><p>But Taiga knows his drive and ambition have taken him far too, despite their different mindsets.</p><p>“Thanks, but you pushed me the whole way,” Taiga responds. “I just got a few more free points on serve near the end to squeeze it out.”</p><p>They exit the club still volleying compliments back and forth, only stopping when a voice calls out.</p><p>“Hey, great match you two! Shime, I’ve got all your travel arrangements for Bucharest set. The tournament starts on the 18th so your flight leaves on the 15th.”</p><p>Coach Jin waves them over, back from watching their practice. As always, the sight of Shime jetting off to his next pro destination stirs an uncomfortable swirl of emotions in Taiga’s gut.</p><p>“Wow, thanks Coach!” Shime replies. “I’m so excited to play my first ATP event on clay.”</p><p>His wide smile and genuine enthusiasm at that moment irritate Taiga to no end. Is he not even a little jealous that Taiga defeated him today? That he remains mired in college tennis while Shime lives his dream on tour?</p><p>But Shime’s pure joy at Jin’s news reminds Taiga that it’s not his friend’s fault. Only Taiga’s parents are to blame for denying his own wishes.</p><p>He exhales, trying to release the negativity.</p><p>“Well hey, I gotta get to class,” Shime says. “Thanks again for the hit, Taiga. We’ll get together again soon!”</p><p>With a friendly shoulder squeeze, he’s off.</p><p>Taiga watches him go, wishing he didn’t have to stay behind.</p><p>“Come on, I’ll give you a lift to campus,” Jin offers, peering at Taiga curiously. He seems to sense the brewing storm inside.</p><p>Taiga just nods and climbs into Jin’s car.</p><p>They drive in silence for a while before Jin speaks up.</p><p>“I know it’s hard being patient right now, but your time is coming. Focus everything on the next two college seasons. I promise I haven’t stopped working on your parents either. Even got a call last week that they might compromise.”</p><p>Taiga perks up at this. “Compromise how?”</p><p>Jin smiles. “If the team makes Nationals this year and you maintain your grades, they’ll fund you playing a pro event next summer before your senior year starts.”</p><p>Taiga’s pulse quickens. A single pro tournament isn’t much, but it’s something. A tiny crack in the door barring him from his dreams.</p><p>“I’ve been talking a lot with your coach too,” Jin continues. “We agree that this team has the pieces to go all the way this year if you can just maximize your potential. I know how much making Nationals means to you. Let’s develop a plan to get you guys there.”</p><p>Taiga feels fired up for the rest of the ride to campus. This is the first glimmer of hope he's gotten in too long. If achieving this goal can lead to even one small opportunity on the pro tour, he’ll do everything in his power to make it happen.</p><p>After thanking Jin profusely for the ride and update, Taiga heads to his first class brimming with renewed motivation. But he struggles to focus as strategies and training regimens swirl in his mind.</p><p>There’s so much preparation needed if Waseda is to conquer their Nationals drought. As vice-captain under Yugo last year, Taiga pushed the team hard those first few weeks, drilling them on conditioning and technical skills for hours. But Yugo reined him in when necessary, balancing his fiery intensity with a more nurturing approach.</p><p>By Regionals, they hit their stride as a cohesive unit.</p><p>Or so Taiga believed, right until their disastrous doubles play cost them a spot in the championship bracket.</p><p>Two epically blown matches by pairs who should have won handily. The sloppy errors eliminated any room for error in singles.</p><p>The burden fell on Taiga in the #1 spot, and he just couldn’t close out their final opponent in the pressure-packed third-set tiebreaker.</p><p>Their season ended in bitter disappointment, so near yet so far from Nationals.</p><p>But this year will be different, Taiga vows. Their weaknesses will be drummed out of them if he has to do it himself.</p><p>Yugo can handle morale and bonding while Taiga whips them into peak condition.</p><p>After class ends, Taiga fires off an urgent text to Yugo before his next lecture starts:</p><p>
<em>Meet ASAP about recruiting. Need to review prospect list and solidify practice plan. This is OUR year!</em>
</p><p>Yugo replies quickly:</p><p>
<em>Hey dude, chill haha. Plenty of time to sort out details. But yeah let’s meet later, maybe grab food?</em>
</p><p>Taiga frowns. Does Yugo not feel the same hunger after last year’s crushing defeat? Making Nationals has been Taiga’s burning obsession since freshman year when he joined the team.</p><p>Now in Yugo’s final shot after two painful near-misses, he won’t allow anything less than maximum effort toward achieving it.</p><p>His sports psychology class drones on endlessly as Taiga mentally compiles a list of action items: review incoming freshman recruits, set up fitness benchmarks, analyze data on opponents, designate doubles partnerships early, and drill them relentlessly.</p><p>By the time class ends, Taiga feels revved up and ready to conquer. This waiting around helplessly for his pro career to start has gone on long enough.</p><p>If dominating college tennis is his only outlet right now, then he will pursue excellence there with the same relentless passion that he one day will on the ATP Tour.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎾</p><p>Taiga bounces his leg restlessly as he sits in the university cafeteria, chopsticks pushing food around his plate rather than eating it. His anticipation makes it difficult to focus on anything else, thoughts consumed with how he’ll break the exciting news to Yugo once his friend arrives.</p><p>A compromise with his parents at last. The light at the end of a long, dark tunnel these past two years stuck in collegiate tennis purgatory. Taiga can hardly believe it’s real, worried he’ll wake up crushed to find it was all just a dream.</p><p>But the conversation with Jin was no figment of his imagination. Taiga racks his brain to remember the conversation on the drive to campus, grinning as he remembers his coach’s words clearly.</p><p>If the team makes Nationals this year and Taiga maintains his grades, his parents will fund him playing a pro event next summer before his senior year starts.</p><p>Just one tournament. It’s far from the full-time pro career Taiga craves. But after endless rejection from his parents, any concession feels like a hard-fought victory, the first crack in their paternalistic rules keeping him confined.</p><p>A chance to test himself against elite players on the ATP tour, if only briefly. To prove he's ready for that highest level of competition right now, not years down the road when his parents deem him “ready.”</p><p>The cafeteria clock ticks past their agreed meeting time, however, stirring impatience within Taiga. Where is Yugo? This news can’t wait any longer; Taiga needs to tell him immediately so they can start planning how to make Nationals a reality.</p><p>His leg bounces faster as he checks his phone yet again. Still no reply to the text he sent forty-five minutes ago.</p><p>A burst of laughter from nearby diverts Taiga's attention. A group of students smile and chat animatedly, appearing relaxed and carefree. No classes or responsibilities weighing on them this late Monday afternoon.</p><p><em>How nice for them</em>, Taiga thinks bitterly. If only he could share in their lighthearted camaraderie instead of the isolation of his all-consuming ambitions.</p><p>But there’s no time for such idle daydreaming. Not with Nationals finally within his grasp after two agonizing years of being so close yet falling heartbreakingly short.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head, banishing the envy creeping in. Last year’s crushing defeat after reaching the regional finals shouldn’t have happened. Their veteran doubles pairs choked at the worst possible moment despite Taiga’s relentless preparation efforts.</p><p>Not this year. He won’t allow doubts or complacency to take root. Every practice, drill, and workout will be optimized for peak performance when it matters most.</p><p>Taiga knows he can be a demanding, no-excuses leader. But exceptional results require extreme measures.</p><p>The cafeteria entrance swings open, jolting Taiga alert. Finally, Yugo strolls in, waving cheerfully when he spots Taiga.</p><p>“Hey, sorry I’m late!” he calls out while grabbing a tray of food. “My study group went long.”</p><p>Taiga bites his tongue to avoid an impatient retort as Yugo makes his selections. He reminds himself that while Nationals is his sole focus, Yugo has other priorities as a fourth-year preparing to graduate.</p><p>Still, Taiga wishes his friend shared his own zeal for excelling in tennis above all else. They both came agonizingly close to Nationals twice now. Does the pain of those defeats not haunt Yugo?</p><p>Questions for later. Right now, Taiga needs to share the pivotal news that will shape the rest of their season.</p><p>Yugo settles across from him with an easy smile. “So what’s going on? Your text sounded urgent.”</p><p>Taiga leans forward, voice low. “I have huge news. Remember how I told you my parents won’t support me going pro until after I graduate? Well, Coach Jin has been working on them, and they finally agreed to a compromise.”</p><p>Eyes widening, Yugo nods for him to continue.</p><p>“If we make Nationals this year and I keep my grades up, they’ll pay for me to enter a pro tournament next summer before senior year!” Taiga can hardly contain his exhilaration saying those words out loud.</p><p>Yugo’s face splits into a wide grin. “Dude, that’s amazing! I know how much you’ve been fighting for this. I’m really happy it’s finally happening.” He reaches across the table for a congratulatory fist bump.</p><p>Taiga can’t help but smile back. His friend's joy for him seems so genuine, without a trace of jealousy or resentment.</p><p>A twinge of guilt pierces Taiga. Is he failing to be as good a friend in return?</p><p>“Thanks,” he replies. “It’s just one event, but at least it’s a start. I’m hoping a strong showing against the pros will prove to my parents I’m ready for a full-time career. Might take a title to convince them though,” he adds with a sly grin.</p><p>Yugo laughs. “Getting ahead of yourself there! Save some wins for the rest of us.” His expression turns serious then. “But if anyone has the talent to win right out the gate, it’s definitely you. Your skill level is way beyond college competition already. I’ll be cheering for you all the way when you finally get your shot on the big stage.”</p><p>His sincere vote of confidence touches Taiga. “That really means a lot," he says. “Hopefully you’ll be joining me on an ATP Tour soon too if this compromise works out. You know, if you decide to actually go pro.”</p><p>“We'll see!" Yugo shrugs. “To be honest, tennis is more just for fun and staying active for me. If I can play professionally after graduating that would be cool, but I’m not banking on it or anything. I’m excited to see where my degree takes me career-wise."</p><p>Taiga nods, trying to conceal his surprise. He knew Yugo was more focused on school than him, but he thought his friend shared his lofty tennis ambitions too. At least enough to be more fired up about finally achieving the championship that's eluded them the past two years.</p><p>But Yugo simply takes another bite of his meal, seeming unbothered.</p><p>“In any case, we gotta handle business this season first,” Taiga declares. “I’m not letting a National title slip through our fingers for a third straight year. The whole team needs to step it up, especially after those disastrous doubles performances last time. But it’ll take maximum effort from everyone.”</p><p>He fixes Yugo with an intense stare. “I hope you’re ready for me to be on them hard again about extra conditioning and drills. The second years too since they'll be our veteran core now. No excuses or whining this year!”</p><p>Yugo holds up a hand, looking thoughtful. “Hey, I get you’re excited, but don’t go overboard, okay? I know your leadership style can be … intense. But collegiate tennis is still about having fun at the end of the day. These guys are balancing sports and academics like us; they can’t make it their absolute top priority.”</p><p>Taiga feels a flare of irritation at the insinuation he’s been too hard on teammates in the past. But Yugo doesn’t deserve the brunt of his frustration over two years of unfulfilled expectations.</p><p>He forces a patient tone. “I know, you’re right. And I’ll follow your lead more this year as captain. But we can’t accept complacency either. I think the team needs to rediscover that hungry, competitive spirit after getting so close but falling short last year. I just want to make sure we don’t leave any effort or preparation left on the table this time.”</p><p>Yugo considers his words and then nods. “Okay, I’m with you there. Finding that motivational balance will be key. We’ll make it happen.” He smiles and squeezes Taiga’s shoulder. “For now, let’s celebrate this big first step in your pro journey! You’ve earned it after working so hard these past two years. I’m proud of you, Taiga.”</p><p>Taiga smiles back, tension easing. Yugo always knows how to lift his spirits and smooth over disagreements.</p><p>“Thanks, Captain,” Taiga says. “I know I can be a lot sometimes. But I really appreciate you keeping me balanced.”</p><p>Yugo waves it off. “What are friends for? Don’t sweat it.” He glances at his watch and grimaces. “Ah man, sorry to eat and run, but I have class in fifteen minutes clear on the other side of campus.” He shoves the last bite of his meal in and stands up. “I’ll send you the prospect recruit files later so we can debrief. Coach wants us to have the new member list finalized by Wednesday’s practice. Gotta hustle and scout tryouts on Friday.”</p><p>Taiga nods, excitement renewed. “Definitely. I’ll comb through the prospect background and put together a strong list of potentials.”</p><p>“Awesome. Just remember to leave room for surprises too,” Yugo says with a wink. “You never know who might impress us on the day.”</p><p>With a wave, he scoops up his tray and dumps it, then rushes off out of the cafeteria.</p><p>Taiga sits alone at the table, contemplating Yugo’s parting words. It’s true the tryouts could reveal someone under the radar with exceptional abilities. Even so, Taiga believes in entering any high-stakes selection process armed with as much data and preparation as possible.</p><p>Why leave things to chance when careful research and planning can stack the odds in their favor?</p><p>After busing his own tray, Taiga heads outside into the spring sunshine. Cherry blossoms blanket the sidewalks and grass in hazy pink, but Taiga barely notices, attention turned inward.</p><p>His thoughts race ahead to Friday’s tryouts as he winds through campus. This time of year always feels full of possibility, standing on the brink of a new tennis season.</p><p>But this one means more than any before. Not just a fresh start after last year’s bitter collapse, but a potential lifeline to Taiga’s dreams.</p><p>The full gravity of the situation hits him then. This single collegiate season represents his best chance yet to prove himself ready for the professional ranks. To show not just Japan but the world the champion that he is, that’s been trapped under the surface all this time, denied the stage to fully shine.</p><p>Taiga’s stride quickens, energy surging hotly through his veins. The waiting and uncertainty will soon end. He’ll ensure this team achieves the greatness it should have long ago, qualifying for Nationals after decades of futility.</p><p>And he’ll secure the pro career awaiting him through any means necessary, be it relentless training of teammates or single-handedly carrying them there himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🎾</p><p>By the time Taiga reaches the lecture hall for his next class, his breath comes short and sweat dots his brow. But the spark of anticipation in his chest remains as he takes a seat and pulls out his laptop.</p><p>Yugo’s promised email with the prospect recruit files pops up moments later. Taiga clicks it open eagerly, thoughts of his upcoming lecture vanishing.</p><p>Over a dozen profiles fill the screen, but two in particular catch Taiga’s eye right away.</p><p>Shintaro Morimoto. Taiga notes the freshman’s impressive middle school tournament results and clear interest in doubles. And his play style analysis describes an aggressive net approach. A potential asset if honed correctly.</p><p>The other is Jesse Lewis, another freshman. Taiga’s brow furrows reading over his background. Those tournament records and playing style notes feel strangely familiar for some reason.</p><p>Then it clicks—the 2011 All-Japan Junior Tennis Championships. Taiga took the title that year at sixteen, his biggest junior conquest. But he has no memories of Jesse from that event. Their paths clearly never crossed directly.</p><p>Still, the coincidence piques Taiga’s interest. By all accounts, Jesse showed promise back then, even if he failed to make a lasting impression on Taiga. Perhaps the five-year gap has allowed his skills to mature and strengthen.</p><p>Taiga shakes his head abruptly, closing the file. Speculation is pointless right now. He’ll reserve judgment until seeing everyone perform in person on Friday. No bias or preconceived notions.</p><p>With so much on the line this year, even the faintest glimmers of talent must be scrutinized fully. Taiga refuses to overlook any candidate who could potentially offer an edge at Nationals, regardless of past results or current inexperience.</p><p>The professor arriving jolts Taiga alert, quickly shutting his laptop. He takes a deep breath, striving to clear his mind and focus on class. But competing scenarios for the ideal team roster continue churning in the background as the lecture begins.</p><p>When it ends two hours later, Taiga’s feet tap impatiently until he's free to depart. His thoughts never strayed far from dissecting the recruit files throughout, despite his efforts.</p><p>Fortunately, the day’s academic responsibilities are complete. Now he can devote his full energy to preparation for Friday’s tryouts and the season beyond.</p><p>Taiga strides purposefully toward the gym after stopping by his apartment near campus. He changes into workout clothes and packs his tennis gear, planning to train for a few hours after lifting.</p><p>The afternoon sunshine has melted away into a light rain when Taiga steps outside again. He tilts his face up, letting the cool droplets rouse his senses.</p><p>Something about the deeply verdant smell of spring rain heightens his awareness, matching the prickling undercurrent of anticipation within.</p><p>This impending season feels different. Like a gathering storm, heavy with purpose.</p>
