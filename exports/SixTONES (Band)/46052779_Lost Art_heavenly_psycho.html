  <b>Lost Art</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Jesse came home, that night, he was beat. He was tired from long days of arduous work in exterior location. It was freezing outside, and the weather was quite windy onsite. He felt like a lump of sand and mud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse barely entered his house when he noticed that the light was still switched in the living-room. Yugo didn’t even hear him enter, his back so round and his eyes so focused that he still didn’t move when Jesse appeared in front of his desk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Leather craft is a lost art, Jesse thought when he saw Yugo working on a new project under the small lamp of his desk, Jesse would spend hours just watching Yugo building something out of his hands. He, too, worked with his hands but it was far from delicate. He built houses, walls and roads. It was a tough job, just like his fingers. He always hid them when Yugo tried to hold his hand while they were walking. He was ashamed of the way they felt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo was a meticulous guy, he liked to spend time on details, like the little red thread that comes loose from the coin purse he had just crafted. Jesse did not see where the matter was but since it was Yugo’s job, Jesse wouldn’t say anything and would watch him get worked up on the smallest detail.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Excuse me? Sir? I’m home.” Jesse joked, making Yugo startle.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You freaked me out, you freak!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know.” Jesse answered, smiling.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yet, Yugo still stood up from his seat and welcomed him with a light kiss on the lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“How was your day?” Yugo asked as he massaged the wrinkles between Jesse’s eyebrows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tiring.” Jesse mumbled before pursing his lips, asking for another kiss. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo complied, crashing their lips together.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Salty,” Yugo joked, licking his own lips.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without any comment, Jesse groaned and pulled away from Yugo who didn’t manage to catch Jesse’s arm in time to prevent him from leaving. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse was already halfway gone to the bathroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo sighed and sat back at his desk, staring idly at a special personal project he had been working on. Should he use it now? He wondered as he opened his drawer to pick up something else and walked towards their bedroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo always knows when Jesse comes out of the showers because there is always this flowery scent of his shower gel that flooded the whole apartment and it always entices Yugo. Today, Jesse used an abnormal amount of soap as he needed to get rid of all the dirt and fatigue of the day. He couldn’t kiss Yugo properly if he wasn’t clean enough,  or else Yugo would nag him and he would be deprived of touching him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he was tired, he filled up on his daily dose of Yugo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The overpowering scent teared Yugo away from his leather craft, making him look up at Jesse who was walking around the place with nothing but a towel around his waist to get some water in the kitchen, then circled back to Yugo’s desk:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Now you can kiss me,” Jesse announced, opening his arms.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don’t want to anymore, it was hotter when you were all dirty,” Yugo grinned, shifting in his seat, feeling his body tingling by itself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Dirty? Don’t lie. You always nag about me not cleaning enough.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah, but I love it when you are a little bit dirty… and sweaty,” His voice dropped so low as he stepped closer to Jesse, his warm lips brushing the veins of his neck. “Always liked a pinch of salt over my sweets.” He lapped at Jesse’s neck that was still a bit wet, a bit hot from his shower.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse chuckled as he took Yugo’s beautiful, smooth hands in his.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Aren’t you a bit horny today?” Jesse asked as he kissed the bony knuckles of his fingers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Perhaps. Are you too tired for it?” Yugo wondered, suddenly worried that his mood might tire Jesse even more, he frowned as he grabbed Jesse’s cheeks between his palms to make him face him. He was looking for any sign of exhaustion. “Perhaps you need to sleep, let’s sleep right now.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead Jesse crushed Yugo into the tightest hug, closing the remaining distance that was separating them. Jesse had missed his lover the <em> whole </em> day. When he was working he was only thinking about going back home to be able to spend time in Yugo’s arms, just like <em> this </em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo didn’t move, buried in Jesse’s chest. He knew he needed it ; every day it was the same routine, he had to suffocate him into a hug to show how much Jesse loved him, to make him understand that he was always there with him. And although he used to hate it at the beginning, he caved in and learnt how to relax from this simple gesture. It had, strangely, calmed his nerves more than once. Now, he surprised himself missing those hugs when he was far from him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Guiding their bodies towards the sofa, Yugo let Jesse flop themselves onto it. It made such a soft sound that Jesse laughed but Yugo only flushed deeper and deeper, repressing a moan. Jesse could see it as he was still facing him as they were lying, their feet hanging in the air. Yugo was extremely turned on and this sofa was way too small for two tall men like them but Jesse had wanted it small so they could snuggle against each other. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Right now, Yugo was shuddering so hard, grabbing Jesse naked pectorals, scratching his skin in the process. He was so sensitive today, Jesse thought but it made him even happier, feeling butterflies in the pit of his stomach. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Let’s take it slow…” Jesse mumbled against Yugo’s ear, making Yugo tremble harder when he felt Jesse’s hot breathing against his skin. Yugo moaned loudly against Jesse’s ear shell. Yugo bit on it, nibbling on the bone, licking so shamelessly the sensitive area making Jesse unravel who groaned when he felt warmth spreading across his body until it reached his cock, awakening it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo was already feeling restless and Jesse’s growing desire didn’t help him calm down. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Unable to resist, Yugo moved his hips forward, rubbing himself against Jesse’s body. “Lemme help you relax?” the older one suggested, his hands grazing his naked outer thighs. Jesse has always loved how Yugo’s long fingers felt against his skin. Yugo was skilled with those, crafting little things. He loved how he always took care of his hands and the way they felt so soft against his skin, making him let out the smallest cry.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hmm,” As soon as Jesse agreed, Yugo rose himself up and ran around the flat but Jesse, feeling lonely, stretched his arms before sliding them over his face. If Yugo took too long, perhaps he would take a nap, Jesse thought, feeling drowsiness wash his libido away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesse?” Yugo called like a little bird chirping his name during early mornings.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hmm?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Close your eyes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse obeyed like he always did, then he heard Yugo move around him, pushing his arms away from his face. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He felt leather around his wrists and a metallic clink echoed in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Are you doing what I think you’re doing?” Jesse’s voice suddenly boomed, his exhaustion suddenly forgotten and excitation replacing it. He threw his head backwards to see Yugo looking extremely pleased at his new handcrafted item.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I made those myself,” He revealed as he buckled up the leather cuffs around his skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Shit,” Jesse swore, feeling himself being pulled away from slumber to hyperawareness. “It’s pretty…” He commented and, straightening his back as he sat down in the sofa, he stared at Yugo’s work made of light brown calf leather, linked with a gold chain. The gold details made it shine brightly under the lights.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo leant over to peck him on the lips. Jesse opened his mouth, his tongue reaching for Yugo’s, wandering inside Yugo’s mouth and gradually, the leathersmith melted on his knees, on the floor, in front of Jesse’s lap.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Open your legs,” Yugo commanded and Jesse slowly parted his thighs for him, his towel unfastening, hardly covering his growing hard-on. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Smells sweet,” Yugo commented as he buried his face against Jesse’s muscular thighs, hands groping his legs to make him slide a little bit more towards him. Even if he was not as strong as Jesse, when he was turned on, Yugo always found the energy to pull and push Jesse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He so slowly pulled on the bath towel, revealing Jesse’s most intimate area in a soft rustle. Yugo had seen it so many times and yet, he never gets bored of the view, he loved how Jesse squirmed for him, the way his cock rose for him every time Yugo graced his most erogenous areas, the way his stomach clenched, the way his ears turned hot and red or the way his veins on his neck would pop out on his translucent skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Instead of going rough, Yugo wanted it to be slow and gentle, he wanted to take care of Jesse for once. And since there was no cloth to remove from Jesse, Yugo simply stared at him from beneath, eyes troubled by his own desire. Jesse was already starting to lose  it and Yugo was only rubbing his hands on the outer part of his thighs, traveling so slowly to his sides, teasing the defined lines of his abs. His hard labour built that body that Yugo liked to stare at for hours and draw the lines with the tips of his fingers. Yugo left a kiss just above his navel, pampering this exhausted body, ready to get ravished.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse wasn’t moving much but as soon as Yugo started teasing Jesse’s tip by lapping at it so slightly, like a thirsty dog, and Jesse finally understood the restraint of the cuffs around his wrist as he tried to make use of his hands to reach for Yugo but he could only touch the surface of his cheek with his fingertips. Yugo pushes Jesse’s hands away as he held his thighs with firm arms, his palms keeping his hip down to the sofa. He reached for a bottle of lube beneath the sofa, the sound of the cap echoed in the apartment as Yugo held Jesse’s cock and spread the liquid all over, stroking him slightly at the same time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In pure relaxation, Jesse enjoyed the cold sensation, and the slow stroking until he opened his eyes just in time to see Yugo’s mouth engulf Jesse’s cock.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Y-yu—…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse already lost all of his words at being pampered by his favorite person on Earth, the pleasure of feeling Yugo’s wet cavity around his sex made him want to close his eyes and explode but he tried to hold it together, keeping his eyes as open as he could just so he could stare at the way Yugo thrusted himself on his dick.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse wished he could hold him but the cuffs didn’t allow him and his strength was testing the tightness of the leather, he didn’t want to break the chains but his body moved itself, he was <em> craving </em> for Yugo’s body, heat and skin. Yugo jolted when feeling Jesse’s legs around his, his toes grazing the curve of his ass, making him release a loud moan pierced through the living room. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse heard a pop, freeing his cock.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Aren’t you a little too sensitive today? What happened?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo couldn’t take it anymore and hastily removed his own pants, turning around and pulling off the waistband of his boxers to let Jesse take a peek at what he was hiding ever since Jesse went to take a shower. Jesse was on the verge of exploding when he understood that Yugo had already his ass filled with something glassy — His dick twitching harder at the expression that Yugo was making, the way Yugo already bent over, his legs giving away from the pleasure the plug provided.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse brought his two cuffed hands to Yugo’s hand to urge him to remove completely the last clothed barrier. Jesse could see Yugo was harder than ever, already leaking of pre-cum. His breath hitched and his cock hardened at the thought of Yugo pleasuring himself, inserting something foreign inside him that wasn’t Jesse.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“P-please, let me remove it…” Jesse begged as he held his cuffed hands towards Yugo, his eyes teary and his cock hardening to the point he couldn’t breathe anymore. For a few seconds, he considered breaking the cuffs to get closer to Yugo but didn’t want to break Yugo’s precious gift.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His throat had no space for any other sounds than breathy moans, so Yugo simply nodded at Jesse before lifting his ass higher towards him. Jesse could see traces of lube smeared, and still leaking out, Yugo literally just inserted it, Jesse’s mind didn’t have time to think about how Yugo played with himself when he was writhing in front of him, much aware of the toy inside him. Yugo’s body was quivering with so much arousal.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jesus Christ, Yugo, it’s insane.” Jesse mumbled as trembling fingers approached Yugo’s hole, teasing his flesh. Yugo felt the cold chains of the cuffs against his heated skin, making him jolt and groan a little before feeling Jesse’s fingers gently playing with the base of the glass plug. It was cold. Jesse slowly pulled it out by grabbing the ends and Yugo whimpered lightly at the sudden emptiness. It slid out easily, the toy still being slick. Yugo’s insides were stretched but definitely not enough for Jesse’s length who teased Yugo’s angry cock with the round tip of the plug, but Yugo didn’t want to be teased, he just wanted more right now as he lowered his hips and started rubbing the crease of his ass with Jesse’s own cock, so subtly asking for Jesse to fill him back<em> as soon as possible. </em> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He groaned, definitely aroused and close to cave in but Jesse immediately pulled away from Yugo and made him rise his hips again before slowly inserting the toy back inside Yugo, slowly as not to hurt him. But Yugo always thought how Jesse was too sweet sometimes even when Jesse knew Yugo wanted it rough. They had had rough sessions, but today wasn’t the day. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo’s body wouldn’t listen to his brain when one of Jesse’s hand was wrapped against his cheek while the other was pushing the plug deeper, reaching that mellow spot that made him melt and moan.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“J-jesse…” Yugo cried.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah..” Jesse muttered, above him, as he kept pushing and pulling the plug, in and out, in and out, in and —</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Stop it or I’ll—“ Before Yugo had time to finish his sentence, he started feeling all of his  arousal reaching its paroxysm. Jesse could see that Yugo’s cock was untouched and still leaking but the way Yugo literally mewled into Jesse’s ear, fisting the cushions of their sofa, was unmistakable: Yugo had the driest orgasm of his life, and it made Jesse grin as he left a wet kiss at the small of his back, tracing back his spine with a teasing tongue, without never stopping the movement of his hand thrusting in and out the cold glass.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Jess!” Yugo ended up ordering. Jesse pushed the toy further before pulling it out definitely in the sweetest pop. Yugo groaned as he managed to gather himself although he was incredibly weak in his knee, he swiftly turned around to grab Jesse’s hands to untie him. Jesse thought he would be free but quickly understood that Yugo wasn’t done with this, and joined his hands behind his back to tie them again. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You can’t get enough of it, can you?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo only smiled as he shoved Jesse’s shoulders onto the back of the sofa.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo slightly leaned over Jesse’s ear, biting it and breathing a few words that made Jesse lose it, feeling chills being spread all over his body. He had always been extremely sensitive there and Yugo knew, especially when he whispered against his ear: “Don’t move.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Jesse couldn’t move with his hands tied in his back, stuck between his back and the cushions of the couch. He felt like dying of not being able to touch Yugo so he bumped his forehead against Yugo’s stomach as he was settling himself on Jesse’s lap. Jesse felt Yugo squeezing some more lube on his cock, feeling extremely sensitive to the coldness of the liquid, but forgot all about it when Yugo guided the tip towards his hole and Jesse was definitely looking forward to the heat and the tightness but Yugo only teased himself with the tip, as if he looked to stretch himself a little bit more before letting Jesse’s length inside him.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They’ve been together for so long that Yugo almost forgot how Jesse one day sprung, growing taller and bigger everywhere that Yugo thought he would never be able to take him wholly. It took Yugo forever to get used to Jesse’s new shape.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t get teased any longer as his hips leaped upwards, looking for heat but Yugo immediately splayed his hands on Jesse’s chest to plaster him against the couch again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He glazed over Yugo, completely in pain, his cock twitching and his body shivering.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Please…” He begged.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Yugo, delicately seized Jesse’s cock before slowly pushing it inside of him as he went down on him. Jesse choked on his own surprise, how tight Yugo felt although he had stretched himself, how warm he felt in spite of the lube.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He loved this feeling so much, the way Yugo attempted to push it deeper so they could connect even more. Yugo started rolling his hips and his breath became erratic at the moment he picked up a faster pace, as he bopped up and down on Jesse’s dick and Jesse didn’t wink once just to admire the sight of a sweaty Yugo taking the ultimate pleasure on his dick. He so wanted to break free from his cuffs to touch him but could only watch him and bite him on his hips, on his pecs and shoulders so he wouldn’t forget that <em> he </em> was also there to love him deeply. Jesse sucked on his skin, tainting it with marks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse and Yugo already lost it when Yugo suddenly felt himself coming. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse looked down and stared at his own chest, Yugo had come all over him. Yugo didn’t really need to bite him to mark him, and that enough made Jesse come twice inside Yugo making him tremble and moan so hard that Jesse lost his mind as they kissed each other’s high. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He was so in love he could keep thrusting, could keep making love to that boy until their bodies broke.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Jesse’s wrists were so red when Yugo removed them. To apologize, Yugo kissed the imperceptible veins behind the clear skin of Jesse’s wrists.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Sorry.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s fine, I like the color.” Jesse answered as Yugo was applying cream to soothe the abused skin. He knew that people at work would notice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Of course you do,” Yugo laughed. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You really like it rough, you’ve never changed.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m not a delinquent anymore.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You still are when it comes to sex.” Jesse joked, wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Shut up.”</p><p align="justify">
