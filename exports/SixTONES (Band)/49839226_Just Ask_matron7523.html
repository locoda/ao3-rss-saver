<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Let's continue with the infamous Drabble Challenge. It seems I'm still stuck with all the pairings that only involve Taiga, but oh well - he's the sweetheart and fun to write! ♥ I kind of realized that this isn't very Hurt OR Comfort (let alone both of them) but lmao at least I tried?</p></blockquote>

<p>The dance rehearsal had wrapped up, and everyone was already packing their stuff. The studio, just a moment ago filled with the beat of the music and their moves, was now a mix of laughter and chatter with the sound of zippers and rustling bags.</p><p>Then, out of the blue, Taiga piped up. "Hey, are we all just bailing and heading straight home?"</p><p>Nods and murmurs of agreement rippled through the group, but no one really offered a proper answer. With goodbyes exchanged and the studio gradually emptying, Jesse quickly realized that it wouldn't be a night for going out despite Taiga's faint invitation. Everyone was exhausted. Juri was looking especially sleepy that night, and Jesse recalled Shintaro and Kochi earlier mentioning their early wake-up calls for the next day.</p><p>But Jesse couldn't help but fixate on Taiga. There was something in Taiga's expression, a subtle hint of disappointment perhaps, that flitted across his features. It continued to haunt Jesse even when Taiga excused himself and bid them thanks and good night, disappearing from the studio right after Hokuto.</p><p>As Jesse himself was stepping outside, the cool evening air provided a stark contrast to the warmth of the studio. Then he remembered – he hadn't updated his blog for the day. His phone was quick to his rescue, and his fingers danced out a short entry.</p><p>
<i>"Today rocked~~ Seriously, the laughs never stopped with these people!! ^^ Can't wait for another round tomorrow. Please wait for the best content coming up!!! Catch you later, all you awesome peeps~ ZUDON!"</i>
</p><p>Alongside that, he posted a selfie taken during a break, his hair a bit of a mess in the picture as he had tried to tame it by using the camera as a makeshift mirror.</p><p>Just as he tapped the 'post' button, he noticed a new update from Taiga. Jesse wasn't typically one to closely monitor his fellow members' blogs, as the content was primarily for the fans' entertainment and not particularly intriguing to him. However, tonight was different. He couldn't resist the temptation to click on Taiga's post and give it a read.</p><p><i>"Wondering if a tipsy Insta session would be fun right about now. But I'm unsure who to ask…?"</i> accompanied by a picture of a wine glass set against a familiar background.</p><p>Jesse shook his head at Taiga's indirectness. "Why not just ask us properly?" he muttered to himself, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth in disbelief. It was that thought that propelled him back inside the office building.</p><p>He knew exactly where to go. Fourth floor. Kitchenette.</p><p>Jesse reached the spot quickly, and there was Taiga. He was sitting alone by the table, nursing a glass of white wine, the whole bottle on the table, lost in his phone.</p><p>Without missing a beat, Jesse plopped down in front of him on a chair, causing Taiga to jump. "Whoa, Jesse!"</p><p>"Guilty as charged!"</p><p>Taiga, still a bit taken aback, uttered, "You startled me there. I had no idea you were still around. What brings you here?"</p><p>"Just felt like hanging around a bit longer, you know? I was checking if anyone's up for some more chill time, and well, here you are!" Jesse replied casually as he removed his jacket, nodding towards the wine. "And seriously, you're not planning on downing all that wine alone, are you?"</p><p>Taiga chuckled, his cheeks faintly flushed. He got up immediately, grabbing another glass from a cupboard near the sink. "My bad, I got carried away. Here, let's fix that."</p><p>With the second glass filled, he slid it over to Jesse. They clinked their glasses.</p><p>Jesse leaned back comfortably in his chair, the wine casting a warm hue on his features. "You know," he began with a playful glint in his eye, "we should make this a regular thing. Wine and conversation after work at one's workplace. Beats going out sometimes!"</p><p>Taiga laughed softly. "Oh yeah? Well, I must agree. It's a pleasant change of pace."</p><p>The discussion unfolded in an easy flow of words and laughter. They ventured into Taiga's newfound interest in wine, and Jesse shared his desire to visit Gero-onsen, maybe inviting some friends or senpai to join him. This led to Taiga explaining his current One Piece marathon. They briefly touched on work and their upcoming single but swiftly agreed that free time was no time for work talk.</p><p>When Jesse spoke, Taiga was all ears, like he was binge-watching his favorite anime, blocking out all other distractions. But when it was his turn to talk, he dwelled on it and couldn't hide his excitement. That was what Jesse had always liked about Taiga – that genuine interest and childlike enthusiasm he had for things he loved. And then the way he listened and added exclaims ("Oooh, that's right!"), markings ("But you can't really eat that whole thing all at once, right?") or just comments ("That sounds great!") was just really really heartfelt.</p><p>As the wine began to work its magic, Jesse found himself growing bolder, his words holding a newfound confidence. "You know, Taiga…" he began, signaling a topic he had wanted to broach earlier.</p><p>Taiga's gaze lifted to meet Jesse's. It was rare that anyone used his first name at work, except for Jesse or Kochi.</p><p>"Don't take this the wrong way," Jesse continued. "But it would be super cool if you felt comfortable relying on your fellow members more often."</p><p>Taiga toyed with the base of his wine glass, his fingers tracing the rim with a contemplative motion. He looked like he didn't know what to say or did not wholly understand the sudden explanation from Jesse. "Um, okay?" he tried.</p><p>Sensing that he hadn't fully conveyed his thoughts, Jesse elaborated, "I mean, you can always ask directly for company, whether it's for a wine evening, cooking together, or assistance with dance steps. We won't be offended." He added with a grin, "In fact, I think everyone would be delighted if you reached out more. We'd feel appreciated, you know?"</p><p>Taiga lowered his head, carefully picking up his words before finally letting them out. "It's not that I don't appreciate you guys. It's just... I'm used to being alone. And it's not a bad thing for me."</p><p>"Hmmm, well yeah, I get it! Alone time can be sometimes boring, but even then, it's not about hating it. But, like I said, feeling like having some casual company is still okay. And since we're your friends, your members, you can lean on us in such cases."</p><p>Taiga's lips curled into a faint, appreciative smile. "Thanks. I guess I'm just not used to asking, either. It feels awkward for me. Especially if I don't have anything specific in mind."</p><p>Jesse shrugged. "No need to feel awkward. We're in this together, right? And well, sometimes, having company even for a quiet evening, can be really nice for anyone!"</p><p>"So, is this all an explanation for why you came to keep me company?" Taiga asked. "Because you felt pity towards me?"</p><p>Jesse shook his head. "No way!"</p><p>Taiga raised his eyebrow, and Jesse realized his reaction might be too hurried, not convincing. So, he leaned in a bit closer, his voice a softer, reassuring murmur. "I'm here because I want to be, not out of pity, Taiga. You're a great guy, and spending time with you is always so much fun."</p><p>Taiga's gaze held Jesse's for a moment, and then he broke into a grin, the unease in his eyes giving way to warmth. "Likewise. Really."</p><p>With their glasses now mostly empty, Taiga reached for the wine bottle and refilled both their glasses.</p><p>Jesse took another sip of wine, the room now filled with a comfortable silence. As the minutes ticked by, Taiga shifted in his chair, his eyes again locked with Jesse's. He suddenly seemed to be searching for some right words, as if the earlier conversation had woken up something in him.</p><p>Jesse, feeling a surge of even more boldness, closed the distance between them just a bit more. Their knees brushed under the table as he leaned in over. "You know," he whispered encouragingly, "it's okay to say whatever is in your mind."</p><p>Suddenly, Taiga's fingers brushed lightly against Jesse's hand on the table, sending a shiver down his spine with the touch. Taiga's voice was suddenly lower and huskier than usual as he opened his mouth, "It's just... sometimes I don't know how to put it if I might want something more than just casual company."</p><p>"Does it have to be that difficult?" Jesse questioned. "Can't it be just simple?"</p><p>"Can it?"</p><p>Before Jesse could respond, Taiga stood up abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. He rounded the table with a determination in his eyes that took Jesse's breath away. In a bold move, Taiga straddled Jesse's lap, his hands resting on Jesse's shoulders for balance. His voice, a throaty whisper, trembled with anticipation. "Is this okay?"</p><p>Jesse, his heart pounding in his chest, nodded hastily.</p><p>Taiga's lips crashed into Jesse's, fierce and hungry. It was a passionate exploration, tongues tangling and hands roaming. The wine on their breaths only added to the intoxication of the moment.</p><p>As they broke apart, their heavy breathing filled the room, and their eyes remained locked. Taiga rested his forehead against Jesse's, their noses brushing lightly.</p><p>"Jesse," Taiga murmured, his voice brimming with desire, "I don't want to be alone tonight."</p><p>Jesse's reply was simple yet filled with warmth. "Then you won't be."</p><p>"Can you come home with me?" Taiga asked, his eyes glimmering with hope.</p><p>Jesse let out a soft chuckle, gently tucking a loose strand of hair behind Taiga's ear. "Of course I will."</p>
