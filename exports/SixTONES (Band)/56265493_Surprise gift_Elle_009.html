<p>"That's a wrap!" the director announced and Taiga heaved a sigh of relief.<br/>
He is excited to go home as he is super tired lately and will get one of his few rest days tomorrow. As he made his way out of the studio while bidding everyone goodbye, his manager went to him with a small paper bag on his hand.<br/>
"Kyomoto-kun, your shoot for tomorrow just got postponed. You can rest tomorrow. Also, here's a gift for you but please only open it when you get home. Taiga said his gratittude and just placed the paper bag containing the gift inside his bag and hurriedly went out of the location venue for their shoot.</p><p>Once he got home, he immediately put his bag on the sofa, removed his clothes and jumped in the shower. After his shower, he put a towel around his waist while thinking of messaging Hokuto to ask if he was doing well as the latter is still in Berlin. He went close to his bag and searched for his phone. While he was unpacking his bag, he heard his door getting unlocked. He got confused as it is fairly late and he is not expecting any guest. He just watched the door get unlocked and in comes Hokuto with his luggage. Taiga is shocked and was not moving when Hokuto went near him to check if he was okay.<br/>
"Taiga, are you okay?"<br/>
...<br/>
"Do you have a cold"?<br/>
...<br/>
"Why are you only wearing a towel?"<br/>
...<br/>
"Why are your things scattered all over the sofa?"</p><p>Taiga slowly went near Hokuto and touched his cheek. "Hokuto? Is this real? Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be in Berlin?"<br/>
"I asked our manager to book an earlier flight as i was thinking of surprising you"</p><p>When Taiga realized that Hokuto is really there, he immediately hugged him and gave him lots of kissed. Hokuto just hugged him back and realized Taiga is still naked aside from the towel around his waist.<br/>
"Taiga, wear some clothes first. Let's have dinner. I bought takeout.</p><p>They were just catching up on whatever happened in their lives for the past few days while eating when Hokuto asked, "Taiga, how's the shoot for your drama? Is everything going well?"<br/>
"Oh. Shoot is going well. we are almost finished with shooting the entire series. Earlier today, there was just a blunder from the staff and I freaked out a bit but it got resolved right away.", Taiga answered.<br/>
"why? what happened?"<br/>
"The staff forgot where he put the key to the handcuffs that I wore. It turns out that he gave it to our manager and they spent 10 minutes looking for it as our manager stepped out for a bit to answer a call.", Taiga managed to say in between his laughter.<br/>
Hokuto, immediately stood up and went to the sofa. He only managed to hear the bit about Taiga in a handcuff and he cannot control himself.</p><p>Taiga did not notice this strange behavior of Hokuto and just offered to wash the dishes for them as Hokuto just came back from a long flight.<br/>
When Taiga was done with the dishes, he noticed that Hokuto was cleaning up Taiga's stuff that was thrown all over the sofa.<br/>
"Taiga, what is this paper bag?", Hokuto asked while checking it.<br/>
"Our manager gave it to me after the shoot. He said it was a gift. Can you please open it for me?"<br/>
Hokuto carefully opened the bag and took a peek and let out a little scream and immediately closed tha bag back.</p><p>Taiga, confused tried to reach for the paper bag but Hokuto was firm on not letting him touch it.<br/>
"Hokuto, what is it? Just give me the bag or at least tell me what's in it."<br/>
"No. Just no." Hokuto said, while his cheeks are getting redder and redder.<br/>
Hokuto tried to get away from Taiga but he slipped on Taiga's bag strap and the bag fell from his hands. Taiga took advantage of the situation and immediately grabbed the bag and opened it.<br/>
"Taiga! No!" Hokuto screamed but Taiga already saw the package and was already getting the gift out.<br/>
Hokuto helplessly just covered his face with his hands as he heard Taiga saying,</p><p>"Why are you red Hokuto? Do you want me to wear this handcuffs?"<br/>
"Taiga. No. I saw the schedule. You have work tomorrow."<br/>
"No, that just got cancelled. If you don't want to, then just say it." Taiga retorted.<br/>
Next thing Taiga knows is that his wrist felt the cold metal of the handcuffs and that Hokuto just lifted him up and brought him to their bedroom.</p><p>With a grin, Taiga silently thanked their manager for the gift.</p>
