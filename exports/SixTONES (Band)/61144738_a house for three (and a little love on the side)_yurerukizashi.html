    <h1>a house for three (and a little love on the side)</h1>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga’s new house came with three rules: no unexpected guests, no messy relationships, and absolutely no coworkers.</p><p>Barely one week there, he'd managed to break all three by offering shelter to his recently homeless colleague, his adorable daughter, and the complicated feelings he definitely wasn't developing for either of them.
</p><p>As a single father and software engineer, Hokuto planned everything meticulously—from Ema’s preschool schedule to his grieving timeline for Rui.
</p><p>What he hadn’t planned for was his house burning down, moving in with his organizationally challenged coworker, or the way his carefully constructed walls started crumbling every time Taiga smiled at his daughter.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Please don't judge because I haven't finished <i>Saionji-san</i> when I started planning this fic.</p><p>That being said, this is my attempt at a comeback. Thanks to KyomoHoku, I've been excited about writing again, but I'm managing my expectations.
</p><p>Enjoy!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p align="center">🏠</p><p>The doorbell chimes through the house. Taiga slides his socked feet across the polished floor, relishing the smooth glide. Behind him, Yugo and Juri’s laughter echoes from the living room, a sound that should feel intrusive in his carefully curated space but somehow doesn’t.</p><p>“Coming!” He reaches for his wallet, already counting the bills.</p><p>The door swings open to reveal a delivery boy, barely out of his teens, juggling three pizza boxes and a six-pack that threatens to slip from his grip.</p><p>“That’ll be—” the boy starts, but Taiga cuts him off.</p><p>“Here, let me get some help.” He turns back toward the living room. “Yugo! Juri! A little help?”</p><p>Yugo appears first. “Got it!” He swoops in, relieving the delivery boy of the pizza boxes with practiced ease. The scent of melted cheese and pepperoni wafts through the air.</p><p>Juri follows at a more leisurely pace, hands in his pockets. “I’ll take the drinks.” He grabs the six-pack, the glass bottles clinking together.</p><p>Taiga hands over the money. <em>This place better be worth the premium delivery zone charges.</em></p><p>The delivery boy counts the bills. “Just moved in?” He gestures at the empty boxes still stacked by the entrance, remnants of Taiga’s afternoon unpacking session that he hasn’t gotten around to breaking down yet.</p><p>“Yeah.” Taiga shifts his weight, unused to small talk with strangers. “Housewarming celebration with friends.”</p><p>“Oh, congratulations!” The delivery boy’s enthusiasm seems genuine, if a bit rehearsed. “Nice place. Those smart lights are pretty cool.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Taiga glances at the sensor. <em>If only you knew how many apps it takes to keep this place running.</em></p><p>The delivery boy tucks the money into the pouch. “Well, enjoy your evening!”</p><p align="left">Taiga strolls into the kitchen, where Yugo has already arranged the pizzas in a neat row on the granite countertop. The aroma of garlic and herbs mingles with the fresh paint smell that still lingers in the air. His smart refrigerator hums to life as he approaches, its display showing the current temperature and ice level.</p><p>“Ice maker’s fully stocked,” he says, pressing the dispenser button. Cubes tumble into the crystal bucket he splurged on during his houseware shopping spree.</p><p>Juri leans against the counter, examining one of the beer bottles. “Your kitchen’s like something out of a sci-fi movie, man. What’s next, a robot chef?”</p><p>“Don’t tempt me.” Taiga sets three glasses on the counter with a soft clink. “The smart fridge already suggests recipes based on what’s inside. Though right now, it’s suggesting I buy groceries.”</p><p>“Because pizza delivery is clearly the superior option.” Yugo opens the first box, releasing a fresh wave of cheese-scented steam. “Perfect timing, too. Still hot.”</p><p>Juri pours the beer with practiced precision, the amber liquid foaming just right. The glasses catch the light from the recessed fixtures overhead, which had adjusted automatically to the perfect dinner ambiance the moment they’d entered.</p><p>“To Taiga’s new beginning”—Yugo raises his glass—“and to finally escaping that shoebox apartment.”</p><p>“And to Taiga finally getting his shit together and bought a house at the ripe old age of thirty,” Juri adds with a smirk.</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes but can’t suppress a smile. “To turning thirty with my sanity almost intact.” He lifts his glass, the ice clinking against the sides.</p><p>
  <em>And to never having to deal with unreliable people again.</em>
</p><p>Their glasses meet with a satisfying chime. The beer is cold and crisp, washing away the dusty taste of an afternoon spent unpacking. Taiga savors the moment—his first real meal in his new house, surrounded by the two people he trusts most in the world.</p><p>“Can’t believe you actually bought a house,” Yugo says between bites of pizza. “Remember when we used to dream about this stuff in college?”</p><p>“While sharing that cramped dorm room,” Juri adds. “With the broken AC.”</p><p>“And now look at this place.” Yugo gestures with his pizza slice. “Smart everything, clean lines, and not a single dirty dish in sight.”</p><p>“That’s because I haven’t used any dishes yet.” Taiga takes another sip of beer.</p><p>“So,” Juri says, tracing the rim of his glass with his finger, “what happens when your fancy tech decides to go on strike? You going to learn actual housework at some point?”</p><p>Taiga snorts. “<em>If</em> anything breaks, that’s what warranties are for.” He takes another bite of pizza, savoring the blend of cheese and spices. “Between the office and commute, I’m already pushing fourteen-hour days. When I get home, I just want to crash on the couch and maybe play that new RPG I bought.”</p><p>“The one with the dragons?” Yugo asks.</p><p>“Yeah. Haven’t opened it yet.” Taiga glances at his gaming console, still wrapped in bubble wrap. “Besides, this place is perfect for testing EaseWorks’ app suite. Minagawa-buchou’s been pushing for more real-world experiences in our marketing.”</p><p>“Ah, there it is.” Juri exchanges a knowing look with Yugo. “Always the workaholic.”</p><p>“It’s called being efficient.” Taiga taps his pizza crust against the plate. “Why waste time on chores when I can automate everything?”</p><p>“Because machines break?” Yugo wipes his hands with a napkin. “Look, I get the convenience thing, but you should at least learn to cook. I can’t keep bringing you leftovers from the restaurant.”</p><p><em>Here we go again.</em> Taiga’s heard this lecture before. Ever since Yugo opened Golden Hour Bistro, he’s been on a mission to convert everyone into amateur chefs.</p><p>“The delivery apps work fine,” Taiga says. “And there’s always convenience store food.”</p><p>Yugo’s face scrunches up like he’s just bitten into something sour. “Those sodium-packed monstrosities? No way. I’m not letting my best friend survive on that garbage.”</p><p>“I’ll get to it eventually.” Taiga waves his hand dismissively. “Once things settle down at work.”</p><p>“You said that three promotions ago.” Juri picks up another slice of pizza. “Face it, you’re allergic to domestic tasks.”</p><p>“I’m not allergic. I’m practical.” Taiga gestures at his smart fridge. “Look, the app even tracks expiration dates. No more wondering if that milk in the back is still good.”</p><p>“Because heaven forbid you actually open the carton and smell it,” Yugo mutters.</p><p>“Exactly.” Taiga grins. “Technology is beautiful.”</p><p>Juri leans back in his chair. “Until your Wi-Fi goes down.”</p><p>“That’s what backup systems are for.” Taiga reaches for his beer. “I’ve got redundancies for everything.”</p><p>“Except actual life skills,” Yugo says. “Come on, at least let me teach you some basics. Simple stuff, like not burning rice.”</p><p><em>That was one time</em>. Taiga still remembers the charred mess from their college days, when he’d tried to impress a date. The fire alarm had gone off, and the entire dorm had to evacuate. Not his finest moment.</p><p>“I’ll get to it,” Taiga repeats, knowing he probably won’t. Between the marketing campaigns for EaseWorks’ new features and the upcoming product launch, his schedule is packed for months.</p><p>“When?” Yugo presses. “After your robot vacuum achieves sentience and demands workers’ rights?”</p><p>“Don’t give him ideas,” Juri says. “He’ll probably try to ask their developers to watch out for that into the next app update.”</p><p>“Actually, how’s that new singer doing at Golden Hour?” Taiga seizes the chance to redirect the conversation. “The one with the jazzy covers.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes light up, and <em>thank god</em>, the cooking lecture is forgotten. “Misa? She’s amazing. Packed house every Thursday night. You should come by sometime.”</p><p>“When she’s not making eyes at the bartender,” Juri adds with a smirk.</p><p>The conversation flows easily now, drifting from workplace gossip to Juri’s latest art installation to EaseWorks’ brand ambassador’s over-the-top commercials. Taiga settles deeper into his chair, letting their familiar voices wash over him.</p><p><em>When did scheduling these nights become so complicated?</em> He remembers when they could spontaneously meet up any evening, crashing into each other’s places without a second thought. Now, Yugo juggles restaurant management, Juri bounces between art projects, and Taiga… well, he’s married to his marketing reports.</p><p>“Speaking of our brand ambassador,” Taiga says, “you should have seen Jesse at the office last Friday. Showed up in what he called ‘casual wear’ — looked like he raided a fashion magazine.”</p><p>“That guy’s living in his own reality show,” Yugo chuckles, checking his phone. His smile fades slightly. “Ah, shit. Time really flew.”</p><p>Juri stretches, his chair scraping against the floor. “Yeah, I should head out too. That commission isn’t going to paint himself.”</p><p><em>Already?</em> Taiga glances at his smart display — 10:47 PM glows in gentle blue light. The evening has slipped away faster than he’d like.</p><p>“Thanks for helping me with the move,” he says, standing. “Seriously, I know you both had to shuffle things around.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s what friends are for.” Yugo pulls him into a tight hug. “Just don’t become a hermit, okay?”</p><p>“Message us,” Juri adds, joining the embrace. His voice carries its usual lazy drawl, but there’s warmth underneath. “Even if it's just to complain about your fancy coffee maker breaking down.”</p><p>“It won’t break down,” Taiga protests automatically, but he’s smiling. “It’s got a five-year warranty.”</p><p>“Of course it does.” Yugo rolls his eyes, heading for the door. “I’ve got prep work tomorrow morning, but let’s grab dinner next week? When you’re settled in?”</p><p>“Sure, just not Tuesday. Got a presentation for Minagawa-buchou.”</p><p>“Wednesday?” Juri suggests, shrugging on his jacket. “I can do Wednesday evening.”</p><p>“Wednesday’s inventory night,” Yugo groans. “Thursday?”</p><p>They spend another five minutes in the doorway, phones out, trying to align their schedules like some complex puzzle.</p><p><em>We’re getting old</em>, Taiga thinks, remembering when their biggest scheduling conflict was deciding which party to hit first.</p><p>Finally, with promises to keep their group chat active and tentative plans for next Friday, Yugo and Juri head out into the night. Taiga watches until their figures disappear down the street, then closes the door with a soft click.</p><p align="left">The silence settles around Taiga like a comfortable blanket. He gathers the empty bottles, the glass clinking softly as he drops them into the recycling bin. Trust Yugo to label everything — neat block letters marking which items go where, with collection dates scrawled underneath.</p><p>
  <em>At least he didn’t try to reorganize my entire kitchen this time.</em>
</p><p>The smart dishwasher hums to life as Taiga loads the last glass. Its display shows a gentle blue glow: 45 minutes until completion, with a drying cycle included. He swipes through the settings on his tablet, double-checking that he’s selected the eco-friendly mode. The marketing team has been pushing that feature hard lately.</p><p>Pizza boxes folded and flattened, Taiga slides them into their designated bin. The cardboard edges are still warm, carrying traces of oregano and melted cheese. His fingers brush against Yugo’s precise handwriting: “CARDBOARD — EVERY OTHER TUESDAY.”</p><p>A smile tugs at his lips. Some things never change — Yugo’s been mothering him since college.</p><p>The tablet chirps softly as Taiga pulls up the security interface. Each green checkmark brings a small satisfaction: front door locked, back door secured, windows latched. The garage sensor blinks steadily, confirming no movement. Even the motion detectors in the yard show all clear.</p><p>
  <em>Everything in its place. Everything controlled.</em>
</p><p>The living room lights dim automatically as he approaches the stairs, responding to his programmed evening routine. Shadows stretch across the walls, but they’re gentle, carefully calculated by the smart lighting system. No harsh transitions, no sudden darkness. Just a smooth fade that guides him toward his bedroom.</p><p>His footsteps echo slightly on the stairs. The house feels bigger now, emptier without Yugo’s laugh and Juri’s drawling commentary. But it’s not lonely — it’s peaceful. Exactly what he wanted.</p><p>What he planned for.</p><p>
  <em>Finally. My space. My rules. My perfectly ordered life.</em>
</p><p align="left">Taiga’s bedroom door opens with a soft click. The smart lighting system bathes the room in a gentle amber glow, perfect for winding down. He taps the bath controls on his tablet, and the tub begins to fill, water cascading at precisely 37 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Steam rises as he brushes his teeth, the electric toothbrush humming against his gums. In the mirror, his reflection looks tired but content. The bathroom fan whirs quietly, keeping the humidity at bay — another small luxury he’d insisted on during the renovation.</p><p>The tub chirps when it reaches the perfect level. Taiga slips into the water, a slow sigh escaping his lips as warmth envelops his muscles. <em>This is what peace feels like.</em></p><p>His mind drifts to that night in his father’s apartment, six months ago. The cramped space had reeked of instant ramen and stale beer. Masaki’s guitar case lay open on the floor, sheet music scattered around it like fallen leaves.</p><p>“You can’t leave,” Masaki had said, his voice carrying that familiar whine. “Who’s going to help me with the bills? And my new song needs—”</p><p>“I’m not your personal ATM.” The words had burst from Taiga’s throat, sharp and bitter. “Or your sound engineer.”</p><p>“But you’re good at it! And Shuichiro said—”</p><p>“Don’t.” Taiga had cut him off. “Don’t bring him into this.”</p><p>The bathwater ripples as Taiga shifts, the memory of Shuichiro’s manipulative smile rising unbidden. His ex had always known exactly which buttons to push, especially when it came to Masaki.</p><p><em>“Your father needs you,”</em> he’d say, <em>“and I need you too.”</em></p><p>Thank god for Minagawa’s real estate contact. The thought of house-hunting through Shuichiro’s agency had turned Taiga’s stomach. Those casual touches that lingered too long, the way Shuichiro would lean in close while pointing out property features — all carefully calculated to make Taiga doubt his decision to leave.</p><p>The argument with Masaki had been the final straw. Taiga remembers standing in that cluttered apartment, watching his father cradle his guitar like a shield.</p><p>“I’m almost thirty years old,” Taiga had said, his voice steady despite the trembling in his hands. “I can’t keep being your safety net.”</p><p>“But we’re family,” Masaki had protested. “Family takes care of each other.”</p><p>
  <em>Family doesn’t guilt-trip each other into codependency.</em>
</p><p>Water drips from the faucet, each drop echoing in the quiet bathroom. Taiga sinks deeper into the tub, letting the heat seep into his bones. His tablet rests on the nearby shelf, its screen showing the temperature holding steady. No fluctuations, no surprises. Just perfect, controlled warmth.</p><p>He’d found this house two weeks after that argument. The location was ideal — close enough to work but far from both Masaki’s apartment and Shuichiro’s usual haunts. The previous owners had already installed smart home basics, giving Taiga the perfect excuse to upgrade everything.</p><p>
  <em>A fresh start. A place where no one can demand pieces of me.</em>
</p><p>The memory of Shuichiro’s last text message floats through his mind: “You’re making a mistake. You need me.”</p><p>Delete. Block. Gone.</p><p align="left">Taiga emerges from the tub, water cascading off his skin. His fingers brush the towel rack, and he wraps himself in the plush cotton robe he’d splurged on during his bathroom shopping spree. The fabric feels impossibly soft against his skin, still warm from the bath.</p><p>The smart lights shift to a cooler tone as he pads across the bedroom carpet, responding to his nighttime routine settings. His bare feet sink into the plush fibers with each step. The dresser drawer slides open with a satisfying whisper, revealing neatly folded stacks of sleepwear.</p><p>He pulls out simple black cotton pants and a worn t-shirt from some tech conference three years ago. The fabric is soft from countless washes, familiar against his skin as he slips them on. His damp hair leaves a dark patch on the collar, but he can’t bring himself to care.</p><p>The bed welcomes him with memory foam perfection, conforming to his body as he settles against the headboard. No squeaky springs, no lumpy mattress like his old apartment. Just engineered comfort, calibrated to his preferences.</p><p>His Nintendo Switch sits on the nightstand. The console powers up with a satisfying chime, its screen casting a blue glow across his bedroom.</p><p><em>Finally, some proper me-time</em>.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> title screen fills the display, all epic music and swirling flames. He’d been eyeing this game for weeks, saving it as a reward for getting through the move.</p><p>Taiga adjusts his position, sinking deeper into his pillows as he picks up his last saved spot. His fingers move across the controls, directing Link around the world of Hyrule for some side quests.</p><p>The bedroom’s ambient temperature adjusts slightly, the smart thermostat compensating for his lowered activity. Outside, a car passes by, its headlights briefly painting shadows across his ceiling. But inside his room, inside his perfectly controlled space, Taiga focuses solely on the game world unfolding before him.</p><p>The game autosaves as Taiga clears his first side quest of the night. Link stands victorious, a satisfying conclusion to his first gaming session in the new house.</p><p>His phone buzzes against the nightstand. Without checking the caller ID, Taiga swipes to answer, mind still half-lost in the game’s world.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Taiga!” Masaki’s voice blares through the speaker. “How’s the new place? Did you get everything unpacked?”</p><p><em>Shit.</em> Taiga’s stomach clenches. He should have checked the caller ID.</p><p>“Dad, it’s almost midnight.” He pinches the bridge of his nose, the pleasant fog of gaming evaporating. “I was about to go to sleep.”</p><p>“Already? But we haven’t talked in weeks! The apartment’s so quiet without you.” Masaki’s tone shifts into that familiar wheedling note. “I’ve been working on this new song, and I really need your opinion on the bridge—”</p><p>“Not tonight.” Taiga’s jaw tightens. “I’ve got work tomorrow.”</p><p>“Just five minutes! You know how much I value your input.” A pause, then: “Actually, I’ve been thinking. Your new place probably has plenty of room, right? Maybe I could—”</p><p>“No.” The words shoot out before Masaki can finish. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“But think about it! We could split the bills, and I could use one of the rooms as a studio. It would be just like old times, when you helped with my recordings.”</p><p><em>Old times.</em> Like when Masaki’s “temporary stays” stretched into months. When every surface disappeared under scattered sheet music and empty beer cans. When Taiga’s savings account drained to cover “emergency expenses” that somehow always coincided with new guitar accessories.</p><p>“Those times are over.” Taiga’s fingers grip his phone tighter. “I bought this house for myself. To have my own space.”</p><p>“You’re being selfish.” Masaki’s voice takes that wounded tone that used to make Taiga cave instantly. “After everything I’ve done—”</p><p>“Everything you’ve done?” Heat rises in Taiga’s chest. “You mean like using my rent money for guitar strings? Or telling Shuichiro about my promotion so he could calculate exactly how much more he could squeeze out of me?”</p><p>“That’s not fair! Shuichiro was just trying to help—”</p><p>“I’m hanging up now.”</p><p>“Wait, Taiga—”</p><p>Taiga jabs the end call button. His hands shake as he switches his phone to airplane mode. The screen goes dark, his reflection a ghostly outline against the black glass.</p><p>A scream builds in his throat, raw and burning. He grabs his pillow, presses it against his face, and lets out a muffled howl of frustration. The sound disappears into the expensive memory foam, leaving only the rapid thud of his heartbeat in his ears.</p><p>“Lights off,” he barks.</p><p>The room plunges into darkness, his smart home system responding to the anger in his voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🏠</p><p>The spreadsheet numbers blur together, and Taiga blinks hard, trying to refocus. His third attempt at the engagement metrics reveals the same patterns—users dropping off after the third notification.</p><p>
  <em>There has to be a better way to present this to Matsumoto-buchou.</em>
</p><p>He rolls his shoulders back, vertebrae popping as he stretches. The office lights feel too bright, and the afternoon slump hits him like a weighted blanket.</p><p>“Coffee?” Noel’s voice drifts from the next desk. “You look like you could use some.”</p><p>Taiga glances at his empty mug, a ring of dried coffee staining the bottom. “Yeah, probably should.”</p><p>They stand, and Taiga’s knees crack in protest. The walk to Minagawa’s desk feels longer than usual, his feet dragging slightly.</p><p>“Heading to the break room,” Noel says, and Minagawa waves them off without looking up from his phone, probably lost in another mobile game.</p><p>The hallway stretches before them, sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Despite the clear winter sky, the sun hangs low, a reminder of how short the days have become. Taiga’s watch reads 2:48 PM.</p><p>“Fair warning,” Noel says as they approach the break room. “The Chaos Trio’s been camped out there for the last twenty minutes. Chaka claims he’s ‘testing user engagement scenarios,’ but I’m pretty sure they’re just trading gossip.”</p><p>Taiga’s shoulders tense. “Great.”</p><p>Noel’s lips quirk up. “Brave man.”</p><p>The sound of laughter echoes from the pantry, Chaka’s distinctive voice rising above the others. <em>Just get in, make coffee, get out</em>, Taiga tells himself. No need to engage.</p><p>The pantry doors slide open, revealing the Chaos Trio huddled around their usual spot. Machu perches on a stool while Chaka and Shime lean against the high table, phones in hand. Their laughter cuts off as Taiga and Noel enter.</p><p>“Speaking of the devil!” Chaka’s eyes light up. “How was your date with Jesse?”</p><p><em>Damn.</em> Taiga heads straight for the coffee machine, pressing buttons with more force than necessary. “Not a date. Just a business lunch.”</p><p>“At that fancy new Italian place?” Shime whistles. “Seems pretty date-like to me.”</p><p>The coffee machine whirs to life, and Taiga focuses on the steady drip of dark liquid into his cup. “He wanted to discuss the upcoming commercial shoot. That’s all.”</p><p>“But why not meet here?” Machu asks, genuine curiosity in his voice. “We have perfectly good meeting rooms.”</p><p>“Jesse offered to buy lunch.” The words taste bitter in Taiga’s mouth. “Couldn’t exactly say no when he’s our biggest endorsement deal this year.”</p><p>Noel hums in agreement, coming to stand beside him at the coffee station. “Smart move. Keep the talent happy.”</p><p>“Oh, he’s happy alright.” Chaka grins. “Did you see how he practically sprinted to Kyomo’s desk last week? Even though he was supposedly ‘too busy’ for the marketing brief meeting that morning?”</p><p>Heat creeps up Taiga’s neck. The coffee machine beeps, and he grabs his cup, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Jesse’s visits have become more frequent lately—stopping by with coffee, asking about Taiga’s weekend plans, finding excuses to lean over his desk. The attention makes Taiga’s skin crawl, reminds him too much of how Shuichiro used to corner him at work before they started dating.</p><p>“You should go for it,” Shime says, waggling his eyebrows. “How often do you get the chance to date a celebrity?”</p><p>“Not interested.” Taiga adds a splash of milk to his coffee, watching it swirl into cloudy patterns. Dating is the last thing he needs right now, especially with someone as high-maintenance as Jesse. The drama, the public attention, the constant need for validation—he’s had enough of that to last a lifetime.</p><p>“But he’s so into you!” Machu protests. “And he seems nice. Unlike…” He trails off, clearly thinking better of mentioning Taiga’s ex-boyfriend.</p><p>“Drop it.” Taiga’s voice comes out sharper than intended.</p><p>The Chaos Trio exchange glances, and even Noel shifts uncomfortably beside him.</p><p><em>Just tell Jesse directly</em>, a voice in his head suggests. But every time Taiga considers it, he remembers the endorsement contract sitting on Minagawa’s desk. One wrong move, one awkward rejection, and Jesse could walk away—taking their biggest marketing campaign of the year with him.</p><p>“Well,” Chaka says, breaking the tension. “At least tell us if the food was good. I’ve been dying to try that place.”</p><p>“It was decent. Overpriced for what you get.” Taiga shifts his weight, ready to escape back to his desk, when the pantry door slides open again.</p><p>Matsumoto Wakana, head of the Development Team, strides in, Matsumura Hokuto trailing behind her with his laptop. They’re deep in conversation about something technical—fragments of “user interface” and “beta testing” drift across the space.</p><p>“And then we could implement the—" Wakana cuts off, noticing the crowd. Her sharp eyes scan the group, lingering on Machu. “Don’t you have that bug fix due by four?”</p><p>Machu straightens on his stool. “Almost done with it, buchou.”</p><p>“Almost isn’t done.” She raises an eyebrow. “The testing team needs time to review it before the end of day.”</p><p>The Chaos Trio exchange glances.</p><p>Chaka clears his throat. “We were just heading back anyway.” He grabs his empty cup, nudging Shime with his elbow. “Right?”</p><p>“Right, right.” Shime hops off his perch. “Later, Kyomo.”</p><p>Taiga watches them file out, Machu throwing an apologetic look over his shoulder. The pantry feels bigger without their energy filling it, though not necessarily quieter—the coffee machine whirs to life as Wakana starts making her drink.</p><p>Hokuto moves to stand beside Taiga at the second machine, laptop tucked under one arm. Up close, Taiga notices the shadows under his eyes, the slight wrinkle in his otherwise crisp shirt. Their arms almost brush as Hokuto reaches for a cup.</p><p>“Sorry,” Taiga mutters, stepping aside to give him space. The coffee machine counter isn’t particularly wide, and they do this awkward dance of elbows and mugs until Taiga manages to grab the milk.</p><p>Hokuto’s lips curve in a small smile. “Thanks.” His voice is soft, barely audible over the machine’s grinding.</p><p>Taiga nods, focusing on stirring his coffee rather than the way Hokuto’s presence seems to fill the small space between them. He’s worked with Hokuto for over a year now, but their interactions have always been limited to polite greetings and the occasional project meeting. The development team keeps to themselves mostly, and Hokuto especially seems content with that arrangement.</p><p>Noel sidles closer to the window, gesturing for Taiga to follow. The afternoon sun warms their backs as they lean against the sill, keeping a respectful distance from Wakana and Hokuto’s hushed conversation by the coffee machines.</p><p>“How’s the new place treating you?” Noel’s voice is low, matching the quiet atmosphere.</p><p>Taiga takes a sip of his coffee, letting the bitter warmth spread through him. Of all his coworkers, Noel is the easiest to talk to—no prying questions or excessive enthusiasm like the Chaos Trio, just calm interest and the occasional dry observation.</p><p>“It’s peaceful.” <em>When my father isn’t calling</em>, he adds silently. “The smart home setup is working better than expected.”</p><p>“No regrets about the location?”</p><p>“None. The commute’s reasonable and—”</p><p>“I understand the deadline pressure,” Wakana’s voice carries across the pantry, “but we need those features thoroughly tested before—”</p><p>“I can’t stay late tonight,” Hokuto interrupts, his usual soft tone firm. “Or this week actually.”</p><p>Wakana sighs. “Right, of course. Ema-chan’s preschool schedule. I should have remembered.”</p><p>Taiga’s ears prick at the unfamiliar name. He pretends to study his coffee cup as Wakana and Hokuto gather their things and head out, their footsteps fading down the hallway.</p><p><em>That explains it</em>.</p><p>Hokuto’s clockwork departures at 5 PM sharp, regardless of project deadlines or team meetings. Taiga had noticed it before—hard not to when everyone else was pulling late hours during crunch time. He vaguely remembers Machu mentioning something about Hokuto having a kid, though he hadn’t paid much attention at the time.</p><p>“You’re thinking awfully hard about something,” Noel observes.</p><p>“Just…” Taiga swirls his coffee. “Matsumura can’t be much older than us, right? And he already has a kid.”</p><p>Noel’s laugh is quiet but genuine. “Now you sound like the Chaos Trio. Should I expect gossip theories next?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Heat creeps up Taiga’s neck. “I was just surprised.”</p><p>“Anyway, we should head back.” Noel pushes off from the window. “These reports won’t analyze themselves.”</p><p>Noel leads the way back, weaving between desks and cubicles. The afternoon sun slants through the windows, casting long shadows across the office floor. Taiga’s mind drifts to the engagement metrics waiting on his screen, already planning which variables to adjust—</p><p>“Kyomoto-san!”</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Jesse Lewis stands by Taiga’s desk, his million-dollar smile gleaming under the fluorescent lights. He’s dressed casually today—or what passes for casual when you’re the face of multiple luxury brands. The sleeves of his designer hoodie are pushed up to reveal a watch that probably costs more than what Taiga paid for his new house.</p><p>Noel shoots Taiga a sympathetic look before retreating to his own desk.</p><p>
  <em>Traitor.</em>
</p><p>“Hey.” Taiga clutches his coffee cup tighter. “How are you?”</p><p>“Missing you already.” Jesse’s eyes sparkle with mischief. “Can’t believe it’s been a whole day since lunch.”</p><p>A blush crawls along Taiga’s throat. “Right. Yesterday.” He moves to his desk, hoping the physical barrier will help maintain some professional distance. “I don’t think we have any marketing meetings scheduled today?”</p><p>“Oh, no meetings.” Jesse follows, perching on the edge of Taiga’s desk like he belongs there. His cologne—something expensive and woody—drifts between them. “I’m here to see you, actually.”</p><p><em>Of course you are</em>. Taiga takes a long sip of coffee, buying time.</p><p>Through the glass walls of Minagawa’s office, he can see his boss watching with undisguised interest. Great. Just what he needs—more office gossip fodder.</p><p>“Listen.” Jesse leans in, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “There’s this amazing winter exhibit opening at Tokyo Skytree on Friday. Very exclusive, very romantic.” He winks. “I’ve got two tickets, and I’d love for you to join me.”</p><p>The invitation hangs in the air between them. Taiga’s stomach twists. Jesse’s attention feels suffocating, like being trapped in an elevator with too much perfume.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ve got plenty of celebrity friends who’d enjoy that more than me.”</p><p>“But I want to go with you.” Jesse’s smile turns softer, almost vulnerable.</p><p>The sincerity in his voice makes it worse somehow. It would be easier if he was just another entitled celebrity throwing his weight around.</p><p>Taiga's mind races through his options, each one worse than the last. Declining outright could jeopardize the endorsement deal—Jesse’s the type to take rejection personally. Lying about dating someone would spread through the office faster than a computer virus, and he’s already used every excuse in his calendar.</p><p>Jesse shifts closer, his thigh now pressing against Taiga’s mouse pad. The wood of the desk creaks slightly. “Come on, what do you say? I promise it’ll be fun.”</p><p><em>Like a root canal would be fun.</em> Taiga opens his mouth, still unsure what will come out—</p><p>“Kyomoto.” Hokuto’s quiet voice cuts through the tension. “Do you have a moment? There’s something I wanted to ask about the user engagement data.”</p><p>Taiga’s head snaps up. Hokuto stands a few feet away, laptop tucked under his arm, expression neutral. The fluorescent lights catch the shadows under his eyes.</p><p>Jesse straightens, his smile dimming slightly. “Oh, work stuff? I can wait.”</p><p>“Actually,” Hokuto says, “it’s rather urgent. The development team needs this information for our next sprint planning.”</p><p>Relief floods through Taiga's system. “Right, of course.” He turns to Jesse, trying to keep his voice professional. “Sorry, but this sounds important.”</p><p>“No worries, no worries.” Jesse’s laugh is a bit too loud, a bit too forced. He pulls out his phone, tapping quickly. “Here, let me give you my personal number. For the exhibit, you know? Think about it?”</p><p>Taiga’s phone buzzes with the incoming contact.</p><p>Jesse finally steps away from the desk, his cologne lingering in the air. “I’ll see you around, Kyomoto-san.” His smile returns to its usual wattage. “Nice meeting you...” He trails off, looking at Hokuto expectantly.</p><p>“Matsumura.” Hokuto supplies quietly.</p><p>“Right, right. Later!” Jesse waves as he heads toward the elevator, several heads turning to watch him go.</p><p>Taiga slumps in his chair. “Thanks. You’re a lifesaver.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks. “Sorry?”</p><p>“For the interruption. Perfect timing.”</p><p>“Oh.” Hokuto shifts his weight, adjusting his grip on his laptop. “I actually do need to discuss the engagement metrics. For the new feature rollout?”</p><p><em>Of course he wasn’t trying to help.</em> “Right, yeah. What did you want to know?”</p><p>“The drop-off rate after the third notification—is that consistent across all user segments?”</p><p>Taiga pulls up the spreadsheet, grateful for the chance to focus on something concrete. Numbers don’t try to ask him out or corner him at his desk. “Let me show you the breakdown.”</p><p>As their conversation progresses, Hokuto leans over Taiga’s desk, his brow furrowed as he studies the data on the screen. The warmth of his presence feels oddly intrusive in Taiga’s carefully maintained personal space. Jesse’s cologne still lingers in the air, mixing uncomfortably with the scent of fresh coffee and whatever subtle soap Hokuto uses.</p><p>“So if we look at the age demographics”—Taiga points to a specific cell, trying to focus on the task at hand,—“you’ll see the drop-off is most significant in the 35-50 range.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, but his fingers drum against his laptop. His eyes keep darting to his watch, the motion subtle but unmistakable. The afternoon sun has shifted, casting longer shadows across their faces.</p><p>Taiga glances at his screen: 4:47 PM. <em>Right. The preschool schedule</em>. The conversation from the pantry echoes in his mind—Hokuto’s firm tone when telling Wakana he couldn’t stay late.</p><p>“Listen”—Taiga minimizes the spreadsheet—“I can put this data in an email. Make it easier to reference during your sprint planning.”</p><p>Relief flashes across Hokuto’s face, quick but unmistakable. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Taiga waves off the concern. “I need to clean up these numbers anyway before presenting them to Matsumoto-buchou.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Hokuto straightens, already reaching for his bag. “I’ll send you some follow-up questions tonight, if that’s okay?”</p><p>“Sure, whenever.”</p><p>Hokuto returns to his desk with quick, efficient movements. His monitor goes dark, his laptop disappears into his messenger bag, and his desk transforms from organized to pristine in under two minutes. The practiced routine of someone who’s mastered the art of the swift exit.</p><p>A chorus of “Good work today!” rises from the development team as Hokuto waves goodbye. He bows slightly, offering quiet thanks before heading to the elevator.</p><p>Taiga turns back to his screen, but his eyes keep drifting to the empty desk across the floor.</p><p>The coffee in his mug has gone cold.</p>

  <p align="center">🏠</p><p>The sharp winter wind bites at Hokuto’s cheeks as he hurries down the sidewalk. His breath comes out in visible puffs, matching his rapid footsteps. The setting sun casts long shadows across the pavements, a reminder that he’s cutting it close.</p><p>His phone buzzes in his pocket—probably Wakana with more questions about the latest app update.</p><p>He ignores it. Work can wait. Ema comes first.</p><p>The familiar sight of First Steps Academy’s cheerful exterior comes into view. Hokuto slows his pace, relief washing over him as he spots other parents still collecting their children. Through the lobby windows, warm light spills onto the darkening street.</p><p>His muscles relax slightly as he pushes through the entrance, the heated air inside a welcome reprieve. The usual scents of crayons and finger paint greet him, mixed with the lingering aroma of afternoon snacks.</p><p>Hokuto approaches Ema’s classroom, his footsteps quieting on the polished floor. He pauses at the doorway, not wanting to interrupt.</p><p>Ema sits at a small table, her dark hair falling forward as she concentrates on her coloring book. Her tongue pokes out slightly—a habit she inherited from her mother that makes his heart clench every time he sees it.</p><p>Her teacher, Morimoto Shintaro, leans over her shoulder, pointing at something on the page.</p><p>“That’s beautiful, Ema-chan! Your butterfly looks so happy.”</p><p>“It’s for Papa,” she declares, pressing harder with her purple crayon.</p><p><em>My little artist</em>. Pride and love surge through Hokuto’s chest, nearly overwhelming him. These moments—seeing her lost in creative joy, safe and content—make every rushed meeting and late-night coding session worth it.</p><p>“The wings are perfect,” Shintaro says, his enthusiasm genuine. “You’re getting really good at staying inside the lines.”</p><p>Hokuto watches as Ema beams at the praise. She’s flourished under Shintaro’s care these past months, growing more confident in her artistic abilities. The young teacher has a natural way with children that Hokuto admires, even if Shintaro’s obvious attempts to engage him in conversation sometimes make him uncomfortable.</p><p>The cold from outside still clings to Hokuto’s coat, but he remains in the doorway, savoring this snapshot of his daughter’s day. These precious minutes between work and home feel sacred somehow.</p><p>“Look, there’s your papa now!” Shintaro’s voice breaks through Hokuto’s reverie.</p><p>Ema’s head snaps up, her face lighting up. “Papa!” She scrambles off her chair, coloring book clutched tightly in her small hands.</p><p>Hokuto drops to his knees, bracing for impact as Ema crashes into him. Her small arms wrap around his neck with surprising strength, and the familiar scent of grape juice and crayons envelops him. He pulls her close, savoring the warmth of her tiny body against his chest.</p><p>“Ready to go home, princess?” He brushes a strand of hair from her face, noting the smudge of purple crayon on her cheek.</p><p>“Wait! I need my backpack.” Ema pulls away, darting back to her table with determined focus.</p><p>Shintaro approaches, his ever-present smile somehow both genuine and slightly nervous. “Matsumura-san, do you have a moment?” His voice drops lower, meant just for Hokuto’s ears. “I wanted to update you on Ema-chan’s progress.”</p><p>Hokuto nods. He rises, brushing off his knees as he watches Ema carefully pack her crayons into her box.</p><p>“She’s doing wonderfully with art activities,” Shintaro continues. “Her fine motor skills have improved significantly, and she’s particularly creative during pretend play. Yesterday, she turned our reading corner into a spaceship.”</p><p>Pride swells in Hokuto’s chest. He remembers how Rui used to transform their living room into magical worlds, draping blankets over chairs to make castles and caves.</p><p>Shintaro shifts his weight, his cheerful expression faltering slightly. “There was something else... During circle time today, Yuki-chan was talking about making cookies with her mother.”</p><p>The words hit Hokuto like a physical blow. His throat tightens.</p><p>“Ema-chan got very quiet,” Shintaro says softly. “She didn’t cry or act out—she just sat there, listening. When Yuki-chan asked about her mama...” He trails off, watching Hokuto’s face carefully.</p><p><em>I should have prepared her better for moments like this</em>. Guilt gnaws at Hokuto’s insides. He’s avoided talking about Rui, afraid his own grief would overwhelm him. But his silence has left Ema to navigate these situations alone.</p><p>“How did she respond?” His voice comes out rougher than intended.</p><p>“She just said, ‘My papa makes really good cookies too,’ and smiled.” Shintaro’s eyes are kind, free of judgment. “She’s remarkably resilient, Matsumura-san. But if you ever need resources about helping children process loss—”</p><p>“I’m ready!” Ema announces, her backpack slightly crooked on her shoulders. She brandishes her latest artwork proudly. “Can we hang my butterfly on the fridge?”</p><p>Hokuto swallows hard, forcing a smile. “Of course we can, princess.” He reaches for her hand, its smallness in his palm a reminder of everything he needs to protect, everything he might be failing at. “Thank you, Morimoto-sensei. I’ll think about it.”</p><p>“The butterfly needs orange too,” Ema declares as they walk down the hallway.</p><p>Hokuto kneels by the shoe cubby, helping Ema slip off her indoor shoes. Her sock-clad feet wiggle with impatience as he reaches for her outdoor sneakers.</p><p>“Left foot first, princess.” He holds the shoe steady while she balances on one leg, tongue poking out in concentration.</p><p>"You know what happened today, Papa? Yuki-chan’s robot crashed into mine, but it was okay because we built a hospital.” Ema chatters as Hokuto helps her into her puffy winter coat. Her arms disappear into the sleeves, and she giggles when he pretends to search for her hands.</p><p>The zipper catches halfway up. Hokuto gently works it free, noting how the coat is getting snug. <em>She’s growing so fast</em>. Each milestone, each tiny change, feels like something precious he should be sharing with someone.</p><p>“Papa, are you listening?” Ema tugs at his sleeve.</p><p>“Of course.” He secures her scarf, making sure it covers her neck. “You and Yuki-chan were playing robots.”</p><p>“And then we had circle time,” she continues, but her voice drops slightly. Her eyes drift to the floor, small fingers fidgeting with the hem of her coat.</p><p>Hokuto’s heart clenches. He waits, giving her space to continue, but she’s already moving on to describing the afternoon snack—apple slices cut into star shapes.</p><p>The cold air hits them as they step outside. Ema’s hand finds his, warm and trusting. Street lights flicker on, casting pools of yellow light on the darkening sidewalk.</p><p>“Can we have curry for dinner?” Ema swings their joined hands, her earlier quietness masked by renewed energy.</p><p>“We had curry yesterday,” Hokuto reminds her, though he’d probably give her curry every night if she asked. The way her face lights up at her favorite meal—it’s another echo of Rui he can’t resist.</p><p><em>Should I ask about circle time?</em> But what would he say? How can he explain something he barely understands himself? Some days, the loss feels raw enough to steal his breath.</p><p>Ema hops over a crack in the sidewalk, tugging him along. “But curry is the best! Mama said—” She stops abruptly, her small body tensing.</p><p>Hokuto’s steps falter. The memory hangs between them, fragile as frost. “What did Mama say?” His voice comes out gentler than he expects.</p><p>Ema’s grip on his hand tightens. “I don’t remember,” she whispers, but the slight quiver in her lip suggests otherwise.</p><p><em>Take up Morimoto-sensei’s offer</em>, a voice in his head urges. <em>She needs more than your silence</em>. But the thought of sitting in an office, discussing Rui with a stranger while maintaining his composure—it seems impossible.</p><p>They pass a convenience store, its bright lights spilling onto the street. Ema’s reflection in the window shows her usual smile, but something in her eyes reminds him of how she probably looked during circle time. Lost. Uncertain.</p><p><em>She shouldn’t have to carry this alone,</em> he thinks.</p><p><em>Neither should you,</em> another voice whispers, sounding suspiciously like Rui’s.</p><p>“How about omurice?” Hokuto squeezes Ema’s hand gently. “We can draw a face with ketchup.”</p><p>Her eyes widen. “With a smiley face?”</p><p>“Any face you want.” The memory of their last attempt at omurice surfaces—Ema had insisted on giving it cat whiskers, and they’d spent ten minutes perfecting the curves with ketchup.</p><p>The grocery store’s automatic doors slide open as they approach. Warm air and the scent of fried foods wash over them. Ema bounces on her toes, already eyeing the colorful displays.</p><p>“We need eggs,” Hokuto says, mentally cataloging their kitchen supplies. “And I think we’re low on rice.”</p><p>“Can I hold the basket?” Ema releases his hand, reaching for a small shopping basket with determination.</p><p>He helps her grip it properly. “Remember what we said about basket duty?”</p><p>“Walk slowly and tell Papa if it gets too heavy.” She recites the rules with pride, taking careful steps toward the produce section.</p><p>The fluorescent lights cast a harsh glow over the vegetables. Hokuto selects a few onions, noting how Ema mirrors his movements, studying each item with exaggerated seriousness.</p><p>“These ones look good?” She points to a bundle of carrots.</p><p>“Perfect choice.” He adds them to her basket, watching her adjust her grip. Her face scrunches with concentration, reminding him of how she looks when working on a particularly challenging puzzle.</p><p>They move through the aisles methodically. Ema insists on counting the eggs before they place them in the basket, her finger tapping each one through the clear plastic.</p><p>“One, two, three…”</p><p>A display of chocolate catches her eye. Her steps are slow, but she doesn’t ask.</p><p>Something in her restraint makes his chest ache. She’s too young to be this mindful of boundaries.</p><p>“Would you like to pick out a treat?”</p><p>Her face brightens. “Really?”</p><p>“You were very helpful with your basket duties.” He watches as she carefully sets the basket down, her excitement barely contained as she examines the candy selection.</p><p>A young mother passes by with her cart, her own daughter trailing behind. Their casual chatter about dinner plans and homework feels like a glimpse into another world—one where such conversations flow naturally, unmarked by careful silences.</p><p>“Papa, look!” Ema holds up a package of animal-shaped chocolates. “They’re like the ones from the zoo!”</p><p>“Would you like those?” Hokuto gestures to the animal chocolates in Ema’s hands.</p><p>The way her eyes light up at his question makes his heart swell. “Yes, please!” She bounces on her toes, already moving to place them in the basket with exaggerated care.</p><p>Hokuto watches her arrange the items, making sure nothing crushes the eggs. Such a thoughtful child. Sometimes her maturity catches him off guard, making him wonder if he’s pushed her to grow up too fast.</p><p>They wind through the remaining aisles, Ema pointing out items with increasing enthusiasm. Her earlier melancholy seems forgotten, though Hokuto knows better. Like him, she’s learned to tuck away harder feelings, masking them with smiles and distractions.</p><p>At the checkout line, Ema stands close to his leg, one hand gripping his pants while the other clutches her prized chocolates. The fluorescent lights cast shadows under her eyes, reminding him how late it’s getting.</p><p>The cashier starts scanning their items. Hokuto notices how Ema’s gaze follows each beep, her head nodding slightly as if keeping count.</p><p><em>Just like her mother,</em> he thinks. Rui used to do the same thing, tracking expenses with unconscious precision.</p><p>“Your daughter is so well-behaved,” the elderly cashier comments, smiling warmly at Ema.</p><p>Pride mingles with a familiar ache in Hokuto’s chest. He places a hand on Ema’s head, feeling the soft strands of her hair beneath his palm. “Thank you. She’s my best helper.”</p><p>Ema preens at the praise, standing a little straighter.</p><p>The total appears on the display, and Hokuto pulls out his wallet, trying not to wince at the amount. Groceries keep getting more expensive, but he’d rather skip lunch at work than see Ema go without her favorite foods.</p><p>“Ready to go home?” He gathers the bags in one hand, reaching for Ema with the other.</p><p>Her small fingers intertwine with his. “Can we eat the chocolates after dinner?”</p><p>“One piece after you finish your omurice.” He squeezes her hand gently as they step into the cold evening air.</p><p>They walk home together, Ema swinging their joined hands, chattering about which animal-shaped chocolate she wants to try first.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🏠</p><p>“We’re home!” Ema’s voice rings through the apartment as she slips off her shoes, placing them neatly in the small, pink shoe rack by the door. Her movements are precise, each shoe aligned just so—a ritual she’s perfected over countless afternoons.</p><p>Hokuto follows, his arms laden with grocery bags. The familiar scent of their apartment—a mix of fresh laundry and the lavender air freshener Rui always loved—wraps around him. He watches as Ema pads across the living room in her bunny socks, making a beeline for the small altar in the corner.</p><p>“Mama!” She kneels in front of the framed photographed. “Today at school, we learned about butterflies. Did you know they drink with their feet?”</p><p>The photograph shows Rui in profile, her head turned slightly toward the camera, that gentle half-smile playing on her lips. It was taken during their last summer together, before the doctors found—</p><p>Hokuto forces the thought away, moving to set the grocery bags on the kitchen island. The plastic handles have left red marks on his palms, but he barely notices. Ema’s voice carries from the living room, filling the space with animated descriptions of her day.</p><p>“And then during snack time, Yuki-chan shared her strawberries with me. They were really sweet!” She rocks back on her heels, hands clasped in her lap. “Oh, and Papa bought chocolate! Animal shapes, just like at the zoo. Remember when we saw the penguins?”</p><p>The ache in Hokuto’s chest deepens. Ema had been barely three during that zoo visit, yet somehow, she speaks about it as if it happened yesterday. He wonders how much she actually remembers and how much comes from the stories he’s told her, trying to keep Rui alive in their daily lives.</p><p>He moves toward the altar, his sock-clad feet silent on the wooden floor. The incense holder still bears traces of this morning’s offering—a habit he can’t bring himself to break, even on the busiest days.</p><p>“Hi,” he says softly, standing behind Ema.</p><p>In the photograph, Rui’s eyes seem to meet his, full of warmth and understanding.</p><p><em>I’m doing my best,</em> he wants to tell her. <em>But some days, I wonder if it’s enough.</em></p><p>Ema leans back against his legs, still chattering about her day. “And Mori-sensei said my drawing was really good! I made a family of cats. The mama cat had spots, just like that cat we saw last week, Papa!”</p><p>Hokuto gives the photograph one last glance before squeezing Ema’s shoulder. “Time to make dinner, princess.”</p><p>“Can I help?” Ema bounces up, her bunny socks sliding a bit on the wooden floor. “Please, Papa?”</p><p>He reaches for the blue step stool tucked beside the refrigerator—the one Rui had insisted on buying when Ema first showed interest in cooking. “Of course. But remember our kitchen rules?”</p><p>“No touching knives or hot things!” Ema recites, climbing onto the stool. Her small hands grip the counter’s edge as she watches him gather ingredients.</p><p>Hokuto sets a bag of carrots next to her. “Perfect. Can you wash these for me?”</p><p>“My favorite!” She accepts the vegetables with careful hands, exactly the way he taught her. Water splashes against the sink as she works, humming a tune he recognizes from her preschool songs.</p><p>He begins chopping onions, the rhythmic sound of his knife against the cutting board mixing with Ema’s melody. The routine soothes him—these quiet moments when they work together, just the two of them.</p><p>“Papa?” Ema’s voice pipes up over the running water. “Mori-sensei said we’re having a Christmas party at school.”</p><p>“Oh?” He pauses mid-chop. “When is it?”</p><p>“Next week! Everyone’s bringing something.” She holds up a dripping carrot for his inspection. “Is this clean enough?”</p><p>He leans over to check. “Perfect job, princess. When exactly is the party? I’ll need to ask my boss about taking time off.”</p><p>“December 20! Mori-sensei said parents can come.” She moves on to the next carrot, her tongue poking out in concentration. “Yuki-chan’s mama is bringing cupcakes.”</p><p><em>Another event to juggle</em>, Hokuto thinks, but he pushes the stress aside. These moments matter—he knows how much Ema lights up when he attends school functions. “Would you like to bring something special too?”</p><p>“Can we?” Her eyes widen in excitement.</p><p>“How about cookies?” He suggests, remembering how Rui used to let Ema help with the decorating, never minding the mess. “We could bake them together.”</p><p>“Yes!” Ema nearly drops the carrot with her enthusiasm. “Can we make Christmas trees? And stars? And—and reindeers?”</p><p>“We have those cookie cutters somewhere,” he says, though he's not entirely sure. They haven’t used them since... He swallows hard. “We can make whatever shapes you want.”</p><p>“And sprinkles?” She gives him her best pleading look, the one that reminds him so much of Rui it makes his chest tight.</p><p>“And sprinkles,” he agrees, turning back to the onions. His eyes sting, and he tells himself it’s just the vegetables. “But first, let’s focus on dinner. Are those carrots ready?”</p><p>Ema holds out the dripping carrots, beaming with pride. “All clean!”</p><p>Hokuto accepts them with a nod, arranging them on the cutting board. The familiar motion of chopping grounds him—precise squares, each one uniform.</p><p>“Now for the fun part,” he says. “Can you wash the peas and get the chicken from yesterday?”</p><p>“The green ones in the bag?” Ema stretches on her tiptoes, pointing to the refrigerator shelf.</p><p>“That’s right.” He watches her carefully maneuver the containers, her small face scrunched in concentration.</p><p>The knife moves steadily through the carrots while Ema rinses the peas in her special colander—the one with tiny rabbits etched around the rim. She hums softly, swaying on her step stool.</p><p>“Ready!” She presents the bowl of peas and the container of chicken-like treasures.</p><p>Hokuto heats the pan, letting the familiar sizzle of oil fill the kitchen. The onions go in first, their sharp scent making his eyes water. He adds the chicken, stirring as the pieces turn golden brown.</p><p>“Is it magic time?” Ema asks, bouncing on her heels.</p><p>He reaches for the ketchup. “Almost.” The red sauce hits the pan with a satisfying hiss. The sweet-tangy aroma rises, mixing with the savory notes of chicken and onion.</p><p>Ema presses close to his side, watching the transformation. Her eyes widen as the sauce bubbles and caramelizes around the edges. “It’s dancing!”</p><p>He lets the moisture cook off, stirring occasionally. The rhythmic scrape of the spatula against the pan mingles with Ema’s quiet humming. These moments in the kitchen feel sacred somehow—just the two of them, creating something together.</p><p>When the sauce thickens just right, he adds the steamed rice. The grains separate and coat with sauce, turning a warm golden-red. Each fold of the spatula reveals new colors, like autumn leaves catching sunlight.</p><p>“Look how pretty!” Ema stands on her tiptoes, hands gripping the counter’s edge.</p><p>Hokuto steps back, letting the rice rest. Steam curls up from the pan. He glances down at Ema, taking in her rapt expression, the way her eyes follow every movement of his hands.</p><p>Her wonder makes even this simple meal feel special. Like he’s performing magic instead of just making dinner. It’s moments like these when he feels most capable as a father—when he can create something that brings such joy to her face.</p><p> “Would you like to help me with the eggs?” Hokuto asks, reaching for the carton in the refrigerator.</p><p>“Yes!” Ema bounces on her step stool, nearly tipping it over.</p><p>He steadies her with one hand. “Careful, princess.”</p><p>“Sorry, Papa!” She grips the counter’s edge, finding her center.</p><p>Hokuto sets two brown eggs on the counter. “Watch first.” He demonstrates, tapping one egg against the edge of a small bowl with precise pressure. The shell cracks in a clean line. “Not too hard, not too soft. Like this.” His fingers separate the halves, letting the yolk and white slide into the bowl.</p><p>Ema’s eyes widen with concentration. She picks up the second egg, her small fingers wrapping around it carefully. The first tap is too gentle—barely a whisper against the bowl’s rim.</p><p>“A little harder,” he encourages. “Remember how I did it?”</p><p>She tries again. The shell cracks, jagged but workable. Her tongue pokes out as she attempts to pull it apart.</p><p>“Here.” Hokuto guides her hands, showing her how to use her thumbs.</p><p>The egg splits, contents dropping into the bowl. A few pieces of shell follow.</p><p>“I did it!” She beams up at him.</p><p>“You did great.” He hands her a pair of chopsticks. “Now we need to fish out those shell pieces.”</p><p>Ema leans over the bowl, wielding the chopsticks like tiny tongs. Her determination reminds him of how she approaches her coloring books—each stroke deliberate, careful.</p><p>“Now for the fun part.” He passes her a whisk. “Beat them until they’re all mixed together.”</p><p>She attacks the task with enthusiasm, yellow and white swirling together. Bits of egg splash onto the counter, but Hokuto doesn’t mind. These messes are worth the joy on her face.</p><p>“Salt and pepper?” she asks, already reaching for the shakers.</p><p>“Just a pinch.” He watches as she adds the seasonings with surprising restraint. He holds a fine-mesh strainer over a clear bowl. “Pour it through here, nice and slow.”</p><p>Ema tilts the bowl, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. The egg mixture streams through the mesh, leaving behind any remaining bits of shell or chalazae.</p><p>“Thank you for being such a good helper.” He ruffles her hair, earning a giggle.</p><p>The butter melts in the frying pan with a soft sizzle. Hokuto pours in the strained eggs, keeping the heat low. His chopsticks move in small, constant circles, breaking up the curds as they form.</p><p>“It’s like magic!” Ema watches, transfixed, as he shakes the pan gently.</p><p>The eggs begin to set, forming delicate, creamy folds. Steam rises with the rich scent of butter and salt. Hokuto continues stirring, muscle memory guiding his movements.</p><p>“Can I set the table?” Ema slides off her step stool, already heading for the cabinet where they keep the plates.</p><p>Hokuto’s heart skips. “Be careful with—”</p><p>“I know, Papa. No dropping!” She climbs her pink mini-ladder by the cabinet, the one they bought specifically for helping around the kitchen. Her movements are deliberate as she takes out two plates, holding them close to her chest.</p><p>He keeps one eye on her while working the eggs, his chopsticks creating gentle ripples in the custard-like surface. When the center still glistens with moisture, he scoops a generous portion of the golden-red rice onto one side. The weight of it creates a natural fold in the eggs.</p><p>Hokuto moves the pan to a damp kitchen towel, letting the residual heat finish cooking the eggs. With practiced motions, he guides the edges of the omelet over the rice, shaping it into a perfect oval. The surface gleams like silk, promising the creamy texture he knows Ema loves.</p><p>“Plates ready!” Ema announces from the table.</p><p>He nods, carefully inverting the first omurice onto a plate. A quick adjustment with a paper towel smooths any imperfections. The second one follows, just as golden and plump as the first.</p><p>The familiar weight of the plates in his hands grounds him as he carries them to the table. Ema bounces in her chair, eyes bright with anticipation. He hands her the ketchup bottle, remembering how Rui used to help steady her tiny hands as she squeezed out wobbly designs.</p><p>“Look, Papa!” Ema draws a heart, then adds what might be a star—or possibly a cat—beside it. Her tongue pokes out as she works.</p><p>Hokuto takes his turn with the ketchup, drawing a simple spiral on his omurice.</p><p>His eyes drift to the empty chair across from him. Rui would sit there, somehow managing to eat her own dinner while helping a much younger Ema navigate her spoon. She’d laugh when more food ended up on their daughter’s bib than in her mouth, saying it was all part of the learning process.</p><p>“Papa, you’re not eating,” Ema points out, her own spoon already halfway to her mouth.</p><p>He blinks, focusing on the steam rising from his plate. “Just waiting for it to cool a bit, princess.”</p><p>The first bite melts on his tongue—soft eggs wrapping around the savory-sweet rice. Across the table, Ema hums happily, her ketchup art already half-destroyed by her enthusiastic eating.</p><p>The weight of Rui’s absence settles around them like dust. Hokuto watches Ema scoop up another bite, her movements growing more controlled with each passing month. She’s learning, just as Rui said she would.</p><p>His own plate sits half-finished, the spiral of ketchup now an abstract pattern. The familiar tightness creeps into his chest—the one that comes when memories of Rui overlap with their present moments.</p><p>“Can I have milk?” Ema pushes her empty plate forward.</p><p>He nods, grateful for the distraction. “Good job finishing everything.”</p><p>The refrigerator light casts long shadows across the kitchen floor. Hokuto pours the milk carefully, making sure not to fill it too high. Ema’s been adamant about carrying her own cup lately.</p><p>“Thank you." She wraps both hands around the cup, just like he taught her.</p><p>The kitchen feels smaller somehow, more confined than usual. Bills are piling up on the counter—rent, utilities, Ema’s preschool tuition. His salary at EaseWorks covers the essentials, but the rising costs in Tokyo keep him awake at night.</p><p>“Papa, look!” Ema holds up her empty cup, a white mustache decorating her upper lip.</p><p>He manages a smile. “Very stylish.”</p><p>Her giggles echo off the walls as she wipes her mouth with her sleeve. The sound should lift his spirits, but tonight it only emphasizes the hollow spaces in their home—spaces where Rui’s laughter used to be.</p><p>“Bath time?” Ema’s already sliding off her chair.</p><p>“Let’s clean up first.” He starts gathering the plates, muscle memory taking over. Rui would dry while he washed, turning even this simple chore into a moment of connection.</p><p>Now the dish rack fills up in silence, save for the gentle splash of water and Ema’s quiet humming.</p><p>The clock on the microwave blinks 7:43.</p><p>Another evening routine nearly complete, another day managed.</p><p>But the knot in his stomach grows tighter. Something has to change—he just doesn’t know what, or how.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🏠</p><p>Steam rises from the sink as Hokuto scrubs the last bowl, his fingers pruned from the water. The motions are automatic, letting his mind drift to the looming work deadline.</p><p>Soft footsteps pad behind him. The scent of strawberry shampoo wafts through the air as Ema emerges from the bathroom, her damp hair curling at the edges. She’s wearing her favorite bunny pajamas—the ones with a tiny hole in the sleeve that he keeps meaning to mend.</p><p>“Ready for bed?” He dries his hands on a dish towel, noting the dark circles under his eyes in the kitchen window’s reflection.</p><p>“Mm-hmm.” She raises her arms, a silent request to be carried.</p><p>Hokuto scoops her up, her warm weight settling against his chest. The familiar path to their bedroom feels longer tonight, his muscles heavy with exhaustion. Their futons lie rolled in the corner, waiting to transform the space from day to night.</p><p>Together, they unfold the bedding. Ema “helps” by spreading her stuffed animals across her pillow—Mr. Bunny, her constant companion, claims the prime spot near her head.</p><p>“Papa?” She crawls under the covers, eyes wide and questioning. “Are you going to sleep too?”</p><p>Hokuto tucks the blanket around her shoulders, smoothing out invisible wrinkles. “Not yet, sweetheart. I need to finish some work first.”</p><p>“But you’re always so sleepy in the morning.” Her small hand reaches up to touch the dark shadows under his eyes. “Like a sleepy panda.”</p><p><em>Like mother, like daughter,</em> he thinks, remembering how Rui used to say the same thing. “I’ll try not to stay up too late.”</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>“Promise.” He leans down to kiss her forehead, breathing in the sweet scent of her shampoo. Her hair is still slightly damp, and he makes a mental note to blow-dry it properly tomorrow.</p><p>“Night-night, Papa.” She burrows deeper into her blanket, clutching Mr. Bunny close.</p><p>Hokuto rises, his knees protesting the movement. He flicks off the light, leaving only the soft glow of her nightlight casting star patterns across the ceiling. The door closes with a gentle click.</p><p>The living room awaits, his laptop sitting on the low table like a silent accusation. <em>Just a few more hours</em>, he tells himself, even as his body yearns for rest.</p><p>The laptop’s glow bathes Hokuto's face in a harsh blue light as he settles onto the cushion. His joints ache from sitting cross-legged on the low table, but moving to the bedroom might wake Ema. The familiar ping of new emails fills the quiet room.</p><p>He scrolls through the Development Team’s latest updates, his stomach tightening at the mounting tasks. The current build needs testing, and Machu’s comments suggest several critical bugs require immediate attention.</p><p>A message from Wakana stands out—another gentle reminder about Monday’s early meeting.</p><p><em>At least I can work from here</em>, he thinks, remembering the tense negotiations with HR six months ago. The conversation replays in his mind: explaining his situation, the careful way he’d emphasized his commitment while requesting flexibility. Their faces had been understanding but hesitant, corporate policies warring with compassion.</p><p>Wakana had stepped in then, her voice steady as she vouched for his capabilities. “Matsumura’s one of our strongest developers. We can make this work.”</p><p>But even her support couldn’t completely mask the strain it put on the team’s dynamics.</p><p>He opens another email from Machu, detailing the latest bug report. Between the lines of technical jargon, Hokuto reads the unspoken frustration.</p><p><em>“When you have a chance”</em> really means <em>“We needed this yesterday.”</em> The timestamp shows Machu’s still at the office, along with half the team.</p><p>His fingers hover over the keyboard as he crafts his response. Each word feels inadequate—too apologetic, too defensive, or not professional enough. The backspace key gets more use than any other as he rewrites, trying to strike the right balance.</p><p>A message from Shime pops up, asking if he can join tomorrow’s debug session. The casual <em>“No pressure if you can’t make it”</em> carries the weight of accumulated absences.</p><p>Hokuto’s stomach churns as he remembers the last time he’d missed a crucial meeting because Ema had a fever.</p><p>His colleagues never complain directly. They smile and nod when he explains his situation, their words supportive even as their eyes betray their thoughts.</p><p><em>“Of course, family comes first,”</em> they say, while silently calculating how his schedule affects their deadlines.</p><p>Wakana’s faith in him feels heavier with each passing day. She’d fought for this arrangement, put her reputation on the line. The least he can do is prove her right, even if it means pushing through exhaustion.</p><p>The code on his screen blurs slightly. Hokuto blinks hard, forcing his eyes to focus. The bug tracker shows three critical issues assigned to him, all marked high priority. He should have tackled them hours ago, when his mind was sharper.</p><p>Another email arrives—this time from HR, requesting his monthly schedule adjustment form. The template feels like a puzzle he can never quite solve, trying to fit his parental duties into neat little boxes marked “work hours” and “personal time.”</p><p>His shoulders tense as he types, the quiet clicking of keys punctuated by occasional sighs. The living room feels smaller somehow, the walls pressing in with expectations he’s not sure he can meet.</p><p>A photo of Ema sits on the shelf, her smile bright and unworried. <em>This is why</em>, he reminds himself, <em>all of this is for her</em>.</p><p>A soft glow from Rui's memorial photo catches his eye. Her gentle smile, frozen in time, seems to watch over them both. The black frame stands pristine—he’d wiped it clean just this morning, the same way he does every day.</p><p>“Did I make a mistake?” His whisper barely disturbs the quiet room. “Taking all of this on myself?”</p><p>The photo offers no answer, just that same serene expression that used to calm his worries. Now it only amplifies the doubts crowding his mind.</p><p>His mother’s words echo in his thoughts: <em>“Let us help raise Ema. You can focus on your career, visit on weekends.”</em> The offer had come with tears and good intentions, their family home in Shizuoka ready to welcome its youngest member.</p><p>Rui’s parents had made similar pleas. Their house in Niigata sits empty most days, waiting for grandchildren’s laughter to fill its rooms. <em>“She’d have so much space here,”</em> they’d said. <em>“The fresh air would do her good.”</em></p><p>Hokuto's chest tightens at the memory of those conversations. Each suggestion had felt like a knife twisting deeper. The thought of Ema’s empty bedroom, of coming home to silence instead of her chattering voice—it makes his hands tremble on the keyboard.</p><p>He minimizes his work emails, pulling up the train schedule instead. The times blur together: two hours to Shizuoka, three and a half to Niigata. Weekly visits would eat up his weekends. Monthly ones would mean too much time apart.</p><p><em>What if she forgets my face?</em> The thought slices through him.</p><p>From the bedroom, he hears Ema’s soft breathing through the thin walls. The sound grounds him, reminds him why he chose this path. Every morning when she crawls into his futon, every time she reaches for his hand—these moments are worth more than any amount of sleep or career advancement.</p><p>His eyes drift back to Rui’s photo. She’d been so certain about everything, even at the end. <em>“She needs you,”</em> she’d whispered in the hospital, her hand weak in his. <em>“More than anyone else.”</em></p><p>The memory of those final days hits him like a physical weight. The sterile hospital room, the steady beep of monitors, Ema too young to understand why Mama wasn’t coming home. He’d made his choice then, holding their daughter close as Rui’s hand grew cold.</p><p>His parents mean well. So do Rui’s. But they don’t understand that being Ema’s father isn’t a part-time role he can schedule around convenience. It’s in the small moments—kissing scraped knees, celebrating wobbly artwork, chasing away nightmares with silly songs.</p><p>Hokuto glances at his cluttered calendar, at the impossible juggling act of meetings and preschool pickups. His body aches for rest, for an easier path.</p><p>But the thought of Ema growing up without him there to witness every triumph and tear—it’s unbearable.</p><p>“I can’t let her go,” he tells Rui’s smiling face. “Even if it means doing everything wrong, even if I’m not enough—I have to try.”</p><p>An unread email catches his eye—Kyomoto Taiga from Marketing, sent last Monday. Hokuto’s finger hovers over the trackpad, remembering their brief interaction last Monday.</p><p>He’d approached Taiga’s desk, his questions about the report ready. Jesse, their brand ambassador, had been there, leaning against Taiga’s desk with that movie-star smile of his. Taiga’s shoulders were tense, and his responses clipped as Jesse asked him about something that Hokuto couldn’t catch.</p><p>When they were discussing the report, Hokuto was conscious of the time ticking away. Ema’s preschool pickup window loomed, and he wanted to leave the office on time.</p><p>Taiga’s offer to email him the data had surprised him. Most colleagues didn’t notice—or chose not to notice—his constant race against the clock. But Taiga had picked up on his restlessness, offered a solution without making it feel like charity.</p><p>Hokuto opens the email now, scanning Taiga’s precise bullet points. Each section is clear, methodical—no wasted words or unnecessary flourishes. It’s refreshing, especially compared to the rambling messages that fill his inbox.</p><p><em>We barely speak</em>, he thinks, scrolling through Taiga’s careful analysis. Their interactions are limited to polite nods in the hallway, brief exchanges about deadlines and data.</p><p>Yet something about that moment at Taiga's desk lingers in his mind—the quiet efficiency, the lack of judgment.</p><p>The cursor blinks at the bottom of the email. Hokuto should have sent a thank-you reply days ago, but time slips through his fingers like water lately. Between Ema’s needs and work demands, basic courtesies often fall by the wayside.</p><p>His fingers type out “Thank you for” before pausing. The words feel inadequate, too formal for the consideration Taiga showed. But anything more might seem presumptuous. They’re not friends, after all. Just coworkers who occasionally orbit each other’s spaces.</p><p>The draft sits unfinished as Hokuto’s mind drifts to Taiga's desk, to the way he’d seemed almost grateful for the interruption. Jesse’s attention, while coveted by many in the office, had clearly made him uncomfortable. Yet Taiga had maintained his composure, his responses measured and professional.</p><p><em>He’s good at maintaining boundaries</em>, Hokuto realizes. Unlike himself, constantly torn between roles, always feeling like he’s failing at one or the other. Taiga seems to navigate his space with precision, keeping the chaos at arm’s length.</p><p>The laptop screen dims, reminding Hokuto of the late hour. He should finish this email, tackle the bug reports, prepare for meetings. Instead, he finds himself wondering about Taiga’s carefully ordered world, about what it might be like to have that kind of control over one’s environment.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp, acrid smell cuts through Hokuto’s thoughts. His nostrils flare.</p><p>Smoke. Not cigarette smoke or cooking smoke, but something more sinister.</p><p>He rises from the cushion, laptop forgotten. The scent grows stronger as he moves toward the front door. His heart pounds against his ribs as he slides the door open, peering into the dimly lit hallway.</p><p>Gray wisps curl from beneath the door of apartment 403, three units down. The smoke detector’s shrill beep pierces the silence.</p><p><em>Ema</em>.</p><p>His body moves before his mind can catch up, rushing back inside. The familiar layout of their small apartment becomes a maze of obstacles as adrenaline floods his system.</p><p>“Ema, wake up.” He kneels beside her futon, gently shaking her shoulder. Her eyes flutter open, confusion clouding her features. “We need to go outside for a bit.”</p><p>She clutches Mr. Bunny closer. “Why?”</p><p>“There’s a fire drill.” The lie tastes bitter, but panic won’t help either of them. He wraps her in the blanket, lifting her into his arms. “Let’s take some things with us, just in case.”</p><p>His mind races through their belongings. What matters most? What can't be replaced?</p><p>The memorial photo of Rui goes into his backpack first, followed by their passports and important documents from the kitchen drawer. Ema’s baby album. His laptop. All their photos. Her favorite stuffed animals.</p><p>“Papa?” Ema’s voice trembles slightly.</p><p>The alarm’s wailing grows louder, and smoke seeps under their front door.</p><p>“It’s okay, princess.” He keeps his voice steady as he grabs her preschool bag, shoving in a change of clothes. “We’re going on a little adventure.”</p><p>The hallway fills with voices now—neighbors emerging. Hokuto holds Ema closer, her face pressed against his shoulder to shield her from the thickening smoke.</p><p>He takes one last look at their apartment. The dishes in the drying rank. The unfolded laundry. Rui’s old music box on the shelf. All the small pieces of their life together, suddenly precious and precarious.</p><p><em>Please</em>, he thinks, stepping into the smoky hallway, <em>let us have a home to come back to</em>.</p>
