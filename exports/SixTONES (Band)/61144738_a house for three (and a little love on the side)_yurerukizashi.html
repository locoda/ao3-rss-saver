    <h1>a house for three (and a little love on the side)</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/yurerukizashi/pseuds/yurerukizashi">yurerukizashi</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Taiga’s new house came with three rules: no unexpected guests, no messy relationships, and absolutely no coworkers.</p><p>Barely one week there, he'd managed to break all three by offering shelter to his recently homeless colleague, his adorable daughter, and the complicated feelings he definitely wasn't developing for either of them.
</p><p>As a single father and software engineer, Hokuto planned everything meticulously—from Ema’s preschool schedule to his grieving timeline for Rui.
</p><p>What he hadn’t planned for was his house burning down, moving in with his organizationally challenged coworker, or the way his carefully constructed walls started crumbling every time Taiga smiled at his daughter.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Please don't judge because I haven't finished <i>Saionji-san</i> when I started planning this fic.</p><p>That being said, this is my attempt at a comeback. Thanks to KyomoHoku, I've been excited about writing again, but I'm managing my expectations.
</p><p>Enjoy!</p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">a house for three (and a little love on the side)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p align="center">🏠</p><p>The doorbell chimes through the house. Taiga slides his socked feet across the polished floor, relishing the smooth glide. Behind him, Yugo and Juri’s laughter echoes from the living room, a sound that should feel intrusive in his carefully curated space but somehow doesn’t.</p><p>“Coming!” He reaches for his wallet, already counting the bills.</p><p>The door swings open to reveal a delivery boy, barely out of his teens, juggling three pizza boxes and a six-pack that threatens to slip from his grip.</p><p>“That’ll be—” the boy starts, but Taiga cuts him off.</p><p>“Here, let me get some help.” He turns back toward the living room. “Yugo! Juri! A little help?”</p><p>Yugo appears first. “Got it!” He swoops in, relieving the delivery boy of the pizza boxes with practiced ease. The scent of melted cheese and pepperoni wafts through the air.</p><p>Juri follows at a more leisurely pace, hands in his pockets. “I’ll take the drinks.” He grabs the six-pack, the glass bottles clinking together.</p><p>Taiga hands over the money. <em>This place better be worth the premium delivery zone charges.</em></p><p>The delivery boy counts the bills. “Just moved in?” He gestures at the empty boxes still stacked by the entrance, remnants of Taiga’s afternoon unpacking session that he hasn’t gotten around to breaking down yet.</p><p>“Yeah.” Taiga shifts his weight, unused to small talk with strangers. “Housewarming celebration with friends.”</p><p>“Oh, congratulations!” The delivery boy’s enthusiasm seems genuine, if a bit rehearsed. “Nice place. Those smart lights are pretty cool.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Taiga glances at the sensor. <em>If only you knew how many apps it takes to keep this place running.</em></p><p>The delivery boy tucks the money into the pouch. “Well, enjoy your evening!”</p><p align="left">Taiga strolls into the kitchen, where Yugo has already arranged the pizzas in a neat row on the granite countertop. The aroma of garlic and herbs mingles with the fresh paint smell that still lingers in the air. His smart refrigerator hums to life as he approaches, its display showing the current temperature and ice level.</p><p>“Ice maker’s fully stocked,” he says, pressing the dispenser button. Cubes tumble into the crystal bucket he splurged on during his houseware shopping spree.</p><p>Juri leans against the counter, examining one of the beer bottles. “Your kitchen’s like something out of a sci-fi movie, man. What’s next, a robot chef?”</p><p>“Don’t tempt me.” Taiga sets three glasses on the counter with a soft clink. “The smart fridge already suggests recipes based on what’s inside. Though right now, it’s suggesting I buy groceries.”</p><p>“Because pizza delivery is clearly the superior option.” Yugo opens the first box, releasing a fresh wave of cheese-scented steam. “Perfect timing, too. Still hot.”</p><p>Juri pours the beer with practiced precision, the amber liquid foaming just right. The glasses catch the light from the recessed fixtures overhead, which had adjusted automatically to the perfect dinner ambiance the moment they’d entered.</p><p>“To Taiga’s new beginning”—Yugo raises his glass—“and to finally escaping that shoebox apartment.”</p><p>“And to Taiga finally getting his shit together and bought a house at the ripe old age of thirty,” Juri adds with a smirk.</p><p>Taiga rolls his eyes but can’t suppress a smile. “To turning thirty with my sanity almost intact.” He lifts his glass, the ice clinking against the sides.</p><p>
  <em>And to never having to deal with unreliable people again.</em>
</p><p>Their glasses meet with a satisfying chime. The beer is cold and crisp, washing away the dusty taste of an afternoon spent unpacking. Taiga savors the moment—his first real meal in his new house, surrounded by the two people he trusts most in the world.</p><p>“Can’t believe you actually bought a house,” Yugo says between bites of pizza. “Remember when we used to dream about this stuff in college?”</p><p>“While sharing that cramped dorm room,” Juri adds. “With the broken AC.”</p><p>“And now look at this place.” Yugo gestures with his pizza slice. “Smart everything, clean lines, and not a single dirty dish in sight.”</p><p>“That’s because I haven’t used any dishes yet.” Taiga takes another sip of beer.</p><p>“So,” Juri says, tracing the rim of his glass with his finger, “what happens when your fancy tech decides to go on strike? You going to learn actual housework at some point?”</p><p>Taiga snorts. “<em>If</em> anything breaks, that’s what warranties are for.” He takes another bite of pizza, savoring the blend of cheese and spices. “Between the office and commute, I’m already pushing fourteen-hour days. When I get home, I just want to crash on the couch and maybe play that new RPG I bought.”</p><p>“The one with the dragons?” Yugo asks.</p><p>“Yeah. Haven’t opened it yet.” Taiga glances at his gaming console, still wrapped in bubble wrap. “Besides, this place is perfect for testing EaseWorks’ app suite. Minagawa-buchou’s been pushing for more real-world experiences in our marketing.”</p><p>“Ah, there it is.” Juri exchanges a knowing look with Yugo. “Always the workaholic.”</p><p>“It’s called being efficient.” Taiga taps his pizza crust against the plate. “Why waste time on chores when I can automate everything?”</p><p>“Because machines break?” Yugo wipes his hands with a napkin. “Look, I get the convenience thing, but you should at least learn to cook. I can’t keep bringing you leftovers from the restaurant.”</p><p><em>Here we go again.</em> Taiga’s heard this lecture before. Ever since Yugo opened Golden Hour Bistro, he’s been on a mission to convert everyone into amateur chefs.</p><p>“The delivery apps work fine,” Taiga says. “And there’s always convenience store food.”</p><p>Yugo’s face scrunches up like he’s just bitten into something sour. “Those sodium-packed monstrosities? No way. I’m not letting my best friend survive on that garbage.”</p><p>“I’ll get to it eventually.” Taiga waves his hand dismissively. “Once things settle down at work.”</p><p>“You said that three promotions ago.” Juri picks up another slice of pizza. “Face it, you’re allergic to domestic tasks.”</p><p>“I’m not allergic. I’m practical.” Taiga gestures at his smart fridge. “Look, the app even tracks expiration dates. No more wondering if that milk in the back is still good.”</p><p>“Because heaven forbid you actually open the carton and smell it,” Yugo mutters.</p><p>“Exactly.” Taiga grins. “Technology is beautiful.”</p><p>Juri leans back in his chair. “Until your Wi-Fi goes down.”</p><p>“That’s what backup systems are for.” Taiga reaches for his beer. “I’ve got redundancies for everything.”</p><p>“Except actual life skills,” Yugo says. “Come on, at least let me teach you some basics. Simple stuff, like not burning rice.”</p><p><em>That was one time</em>. Taiga still remembers the charred mess from their college days, when he’d tried to impress a date. The fire alarm had gone off, and the entire dorm had to evacuate. Not his finest moment.</p><p>“I’ll get to it,” Taiga repeats, knowing he probably won’t. Between the marketing campaigns for EaseWorks’ new features and the upcoming product launch, his schedule is packed for months.</p><p>“When?” Yugo presses. “After your robot vacuum achieves sentience and demands workers’ rights?”</p><p>“Don’t give him ideas,” Juri says. “He’ll probably try to ask their developers to watch out for that into the next app update.”</p><p>“Actually, how’s that new singer doing at Golden Hour?” Taiga seizes the chance to redirect the conversation. “The one with the jazzy covers.”</p><p>Yugo’s eyes light up, and <em>thank god</em>, the cooking lecture is forgotten. “Misa? She’s amazing. Packed house every Thursday night. You should come by sometime.”</p><p>“When she’s not making eyes at the bartender,” Juri adds with a smirk.</p><p>The conversation flows easily now, drifting from workplace gossip to Juri’s latest art installation to EaseWorks’ brand ambassador’s over-the-top commercials. Taiga settles deeper into his chair, letting their familiar voices wash over him.</p><p><em>When did scheduling these nights become so complicated?</em> He remembers when they could spontaneously meet up any evening, crashing into each other’s places without a second thought. Now, Yugo juggles restaurant management, Juri bounces between art projects, and Taiga… well, he’s married to his marketing reports.</p><p>“Speaking of our brand ambassador,” Taiga says, “you should have seen Jesse at the office last Friday. Showed up in what he called ‘casual wear’ — looked like he raided a fashion magazine.”</p><p>“That guy’s living in his own reality show,” Yugo chuckles, checking his phone. His smile fades slightly. “Ah, shit. Time really flew.”</p><p>Juri stretches, his chair scraping against the floor. “Yeah, I should head out too. That commission isn’t going to paint himself.”</p><p><em>Already?</em> Taiga glances at his smart display — 10:47 PM glows in gentle blue light. The evening has slipped away faster than he’d like.</p><p>“Thanks for helping me with the move,” he says, standing. “Seriously, I know you both had to shuffle things around.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s what friends are for.” Yugo pulls him into a tight hug. “Just don’t become a hermit, okay?”</p><p>“Message us,” Juri adds, joining the embrace. His voice carries its usual lazy drawl, but there’s warmth underneath. “Even if it's just to complain about your fancy coffee maker breaking down.”</p><p>“It won’t break down,” Taiga protests automatically, but he’s smiling. “It’s got a five-year warranty.”</p><p>“Of course it does.” Yugo rolls his eyes, heading for the door. “I’ve got prep work tomorrow morning, but let’s grab dinner next week? When you’re settled in?”</p><p>“Sure, just not Tuesday. Got a presentation for Minagawa-buchou.”</p><p>“Wednesday?” Juri suggests, shrugging on his jacket. “I can do Wednesday evening.”</p><p>“Wednesday’s inventory night,” Yugo groans. “Thursday?”</p><p>They spend another five minutes in the doorway, phones out, trying to align their schedules like some complex puzzle.</p><p><em>We’re getting old</em>, Taiga thinks, remembering when their biggest scheduling conflict was deciding which party to hit first.</p><p>Finally, with promises to keep their group chat active and tentative plans for next Friday, Yugo and Juri head out into the night. Taiga watches until their figures disappear down the street, then closes the door with a soft click.</p><p align="left">The silence settles around Taiga like a comfortable blanket. He gathers the empty bottles, the glass clinking softly as he drops them into the recycling bin. Trust Yugo to label everything — neat block letters marking which items go where, with collection dates scrawled underneath.</p><p>
  <em>At least he didn’t try to reorganize my entire kitchen this time.</em>
</p><p>The smart dishwasher hums to life as Taiga loads the last glass. Its display shows a gentle blue glow: 45 minutes until completion, with a drying cycle included. He swipes through the settings on his tablet, double-checking that he’s selected the eco-friendly mode. The marketing team has been pushing that feature hard lately.</p><p>Pizza boxes folded and flattened, Taiga slides them into their designated bin. The cardboard edges are still warm, carrying traces of oregano and melted cheese. His fingers brush against Yugo’s precise handwriting: “CARDBOARD — EVERY OTHER TUESDAY.”</p><p>A smile tugs at his lips. Some things never change — Yugo’s been mothering him since college.</p><p>The tablet chirps softly as Taiga pulls up the security interface. Each green checkmark brings a small satisfaction: front door locked, back door secured, windows latched. The garage sensor blinks steadily, confirming no movement. Even the motion detectors in the yard show all clear.</p><p>
  <em>Everything in its place. Everything controlled.</em>
</p><p>The living room lights dim automatically as he approaches the stairs, responding to his programmed evening routine. Shadows stretch across the walls, but they’re gentle, carefully calculated by the smart lighting system. No harsh transitions, no sudden darkness. Just a smooth fade that guides him toward his bedroom.</p><p>His footsteps echo slightly on the stairs. The house feels bigger now, emptier without Yugo’s laugh and Juri’s drawling commentary. But it’s not lonely — it’s peaceful. Exactly what he wanted.</p><p>What he planned for.</p><p>
  <em>Finally. My space. My rules. My perfectly ordered life.</em>
</p><p align="left">Taiga’s bedroom door opens with a soft click. The smart lighting system bathes the room in a gentle amber glow, perfect for winding down. He taps the bath controls on his tablet, and the tub begins to fill, water cascading at precisely 37 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Steam rises as he brushes his teeth, the electric toothbrush humming against his gums. In the mirror, his reflection looks tired but content. The bathroom fan whirs quietly, keeping the humidity at bay — another small luxury he’d insisted on during the renovation.</p><p>The tub chirps when it reaches the perfect level. Taiga slips into the water, a slow sigh escaping his lips as warmth envelops his muscles. <em>This is what peace feels like.</em></p><p>His mind drifts to that night in his father’s apartment, six months ago. The cramped space had reeked of instant ramen and stale beer. Masaki’s guitar case lay open on the floor, sheet music scattered around it like fallen leaves.</p><p>“You can’t leave,” Masaki had said, his voice carrying that familiar whine. “Who’s going to help me with the bills? And my new song needs—”</p><p>“I’m not your personal ATM.” The words had burst from Taiga’s throat, sharp and bitter. “Or your sound engineer.”</p><p>“But you’re good at it! And Shuichiro said—”</p><p>“Don’t.” Taiga had cut him off. “Don’t bring him into this.”</p><p>The bathwater ripples as Taiga shifts, the memory of Shuichiro’s manipulative smile rising unbidden. His ex had always known exactly which buttons to push, especially when it came to Masaki.</p><p><em>“Your father needs you,”</em> he’d say, <em>“and I need you too.”</em></p><p>Thank god for Minagawa’s real estate contact. The thought of house-hunting through Shuichiro’s agency had turned Taiga’s stomach. Those casual touches that lingered too long, the way Shuichiro would lean in close while pointing out property features — all carefully calculated to make Taiga doubt his decision to leave.</p><p>The argument with Masaki had been the final straw. Taiga remembers standing in that cluttered apartment, watching his father cradle his guitar like a shield.</p><p>“I’m almost thirty years old,” Taiga had said, his voice steady despite the trembling in his hands. “I can’t keep being your safety net.”</p><p>“But we’re family,” Masaki had protested. “Family takes care of each other.”</p><p>
  <em>Family doesn’t guilt-trip each other into codependency.</em>
</p><p>Water drips from the faucet, each drop echoing in the quiet bathroom. Taiga sinks deeper into the tub, letting the heat seep into his bones. His tablet rests on the nearby shelf, its screen showing the temperature holding steady. No fluctuations, no surprises. Just perfect, controlled warmth.</p><p>He’d found this house two weeks after that argument. The location was ideal — close enough to work but far from both Masaki’s apartment and Shuichiro’s usual haunts. The previous owners had already installed smart home basics, giving Taiga the perfect excuse to upgrade everything.</p><p>
  <em>A fresh start. A place where no one can demand pieces of me.</em>
</p><p>The memory of Shuichiro’s last text message floats through his mind: “You’re making a mistake. You need me.”</p><p>Delete. Block. Gone.</p><p align="left">Taiga emerges from the tub, water cascading off his skin. His fingers brush the towel rack, and he wraps himself in the plush cotton robe he’d splurged on during his bathroom shopping spree. The fabric feels impossibly soft against his skin, still warm from the bath.</p><p>The smart lights shift to a cooler tone as he pads across the bedroom carpet, responding to his nighttime routine settings. His bare feet sink into the plush fibers with each step. The dresser drawer slides open with a satisfying whisper, revealing neatly folded stacks of sleepwear.</p><p>He pulls out simple black cotton pants and a worn t-shirt from some tech conference three years ago. The fabric is soft from countless washes, familiar against his skin as he slips them on. His damp hair leaves a dark patch on the collar, but he can’t bring himself to care.</p><p>The bed welcomes him with memory foam perfection, conforming to his body as he settles against the headboard. No squeaky springs, no lumpy mattress like his old apartment. Just engineered comfort, calibrated to his preferences.</p><p>His Nintendo Switch sits on the nightstand. The console powers up with a satisfying chime, its screen casting a blue glow across his bedroom.</p><p><em>Finally, some proper me-time</em>.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s</em> title screen fills the display, all epic music and swirling flames. He’d been eyeing this game for weeks, saving it as a reward for getting through the move.</p><p>Taiga adjusts his position, sinking deeper into his pillows as he picks up his last saved spot. His fingers move across the controls, directing Link around the world of Hyrule for some side quests.</p><p>The bedroom’s ambient temperature adjusts slightly, the smart thermostat compensating for his lowered activity. Outside, a car passes by, its headlights briefly painting shadows across his ceiling. But inside his room, inside his perfectly controlled space, Taiga focuses solely on the game world unfolding before him.</p><p>The game autosaves as Taiga clears his first side quest of the night. Link stands victorious, a satisfying conclusion to his first gaming session in the new house.</p><p>His phone buzzes against the nightstand. Without checking the caller ID, Taiga swipes to answer, mind still half-lost in the game’s world.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“Taiga!” Masaki’s voice blares through the speaker. “How’s the new place? Did you get everything unpacked?”</p><p><em>Shit.</em> Taiga’s stomach clenches. He should have checked the caller ID.</p><p>“Dad, it’s almost midnight.” He pinches the bridge of his nose, the pleasant fog of gaming evaporating. “I was about to go to sleep.”</p><p>“Already? But we haven’t talked in weeks! The apartment’s so quiet without you.” Masaki’s tone shifts into that familiar wheedling note. “I’ve been working on this new song, and I really need your opinion on the bridge—”</p><p>“Not tonight.” Taiga’s jaw tightens. “I’ve got work tomorrow.”</p><p>“Just five minutes! You know how much I value your input.” A pause, then: “Actually, I’ve been thinking. Your new place probably has plenty of room, right? Maybe I could—”</p><p>“No.” The words shoot out before Masaki can finish. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“But think about it! We could split the bills, and I could use one of the rooms as a studio. It would be just like old times, when you helped with my recordings.”</p><p><em>Old times.</em> Like when Masaki’s “temporary stays” stretched into months. When every surface disappeared under scattered sheet music and empty beer cans. When Taiga’s savings account drained to cover “emergency expenses” that somehow always coincided with new guitar accessories.</p><p>“Those times are over.” Taiga’s fingers grip his phone tighter. “I bought this house for myself. To have my own space.”</p><p>“You’re being selfish.” Masaki’s voice takes that wounded tone that used to make Taiga cave instantly. “After everything I’ve done—”</p><p>“Everything you’ve done?” Heat rises in Taiga’s chest. “You mean like using my rent money for guitar strings? Or telling Shuichiro about my promotion so he could calculate exactly how much more he could squeeze out of me?”</p><p>“That’s not fair! Shuichiro was just trying to help—”</p><p>“I’m hanging up now.”</p><p>“Wait, Taiga—”</p><p>Taiga jabs the end call button. His hands shake as he switches his phone to airplane mode. The screen goes dark, his reflection a ghostly outline against the black glass.</p><p>A scream builds in his throat, raw and burning. He grabs his pillow, presses it against his face, and lets out a muffled howl of frustration. The sound disappears into the expensive memory foam, leaving only the rapid thud of his heartbeat in his ears.</p><p>“Lights off,” he barks.</p><p>The room plunges into darkness, his smart home system responding to the anger in his voice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">🏠</p><p>The spreadsheet numbers blur together, and Taiga blinks hard, trying to refocus. His third attempt at the engagement metrics reveals the same patterns—users dropping off after the third notification.</p><p>
  <em>There has to be a better way to present this to Matsumoto-buchou.</em>
</p><p>He rolls his shoulders back, vertebrae popping as he stretches. The office lights feel too bright, and the afternoon slump hits him like a weighted blanket.</p><p>“Coffee?” Noel’s voice drifts from the next desk. “You look like you could use some.”</p><p>Taiga glances at his empty mug, a ring of dried coffee staining the bottom. “Yeah, probably should.”</p><p>They stand, and Taiga’s knees crack in protest. The walk to Minagawa’s desk feels longer than usual, his feet dragging slightly.</p><p>“Heading to the break room,” Noel says, and Minagawa waves them off without looking up from his phone, probably lost in another mobile game.</p><p>The hallway stretches before them, sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Despite the clear winter sky, the sun hangs low, a reminder of how short the days have become. Taiga’s watch reads 2:48 PM.</p><p>“Fair warning,” Noel says as they approach the break room. “The Chaos Trio’s been camped out there for the last twenty minutes. Chaka claims he’s ‘testing user engagement scenarios,’ but I’m pretty sure they’re just trading gossip.”</p><p>Taiga’s shoulders tense. “Great.”</p><p>Noel’s lips quirk up. “Brave man.”</p><p>The sound of laughter echoes from the pantry, Chaka’s distinctive voice rising above the others. <em>Just get in, make coffee, get out</em>, Taiga tells himself. No need to engage.</p><p>The pantry doors slide open, revealing the Chaos Trio huddled around their usual spot. Machu perches on a stool while Chaka and Shime lean against the high table, phones in hand. Their laughter cuts off as Taiga and Noel enter.</p><p>“Speaking of the devil!” Chaka’s eyes light up. “How was your date with Jesse?”</p><p><em>Damn.</em> Taiga heads straight for the coffee machine, pressing buttons with more force than necessary. “Not a date. Just a business lunch.”</p><p>“At that fancy new Italian place?” Shime whistles. “Seems pretty date-like to me.”</p><p>The coffee machine whirs to life, and Taiga focuses on the steady drip of dark liquid into his cup. “He wanted to discuss the upcoming commercial shoot. That’s all.”</p><p>“But why not meet here?” Machu asks, genuine curiosity in his voice. “We have perfectly good meeting rooms.”</p><p>“Jesse offered to buy lunch.” The words taste bitter in Taiga’s mouth. “Couldn’t exactly say no when he’s our biggest endorsement deal this year.”</p><p>Noel hums in agreement, coming to stand beside him at the coffee station. “Smart move. Keep the talent happy.”</p><p>“Oh, he’s happy alright.” Chaka grins. “Did you see how he practically sprinted to Kyomo’s desk last week? Even though he was supposedly ‘too busy’ for the marketing brief meeting that morning?”</p><p>Heat creeps up Taiga’s neck. The coffee machine beeps, and he grabs his cup, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Jesse’s visits have become more frequent lately—stopping by with coffee, asking about Taiga’s weekend plans, finding excuses to lean over his desk. The attention makes Taiga’s skin crawl, reminds him too much of how Shuichiro used to corner him at work before they started dating.</p><p>“You should go for it,” Shime says, waggling his eyebrows. “How often do you get the chance to date a celebrity?”</p><p>“Not interested.” Taiga adds a splash of milk to his coffee, watching it swirl into cloudy patterns. Dating is the last thing he needs right now, especially with someone as high-maintenance as Jesse. The drama, the public attention, the constant need for validation—he’s had enough of that to last a lifetime.</p><p>“But he’s so into you!” Machu protests. “And he seems nice. Unlike…” He trails off, clearly thinking better of mentioning Taiga’s ex-boyfriend.</p><p>“Drop it.” Taiga’s voice comes out sharper than intended.</p><p>The Chaos Trio exchange glances, and even Noel shifts uncomfortably beside him.</p><p><em>Just tell Jesse directly</em>, a voice in his head suggests. But every time Taiga considers it, he remembers the endorsement contract sitting on Minagawa’s desk. One wrong move, one awkward rejection, and Jesse could walk away—taking their biggest marketing campaign of the year with him.</p><p>“Well,” Chaka says, breaking the tension. “At least tell us if the food was good. I’ve been dying to try that place.”</p><p>“It was decent. Overpriced for what you get.” Taiga shifts his weight, ready to escape back to his desk, when the pantry door slides open again.</p><p>Matsumoto Wakana, head of the Development Team, strides in, Matsumura Hokuto trailing behind her with his laptop. They’re deep in conversation about something technical—fragments of “user interface” and “beta testing” drift across the space.</p><p>“And then we could implement the—" Wakana cuts off, noticing the crowd. Her sharp eyes scan the group, lingering on Machu. “Don’t you have that bug fix due by four?”</p><p>Machu straightens on his stool. “Almost done with it, buchou.”</p><p>“Almost isn’t done.” She raises an eyebrow. “The testing team needs time to review it before the end of day.”</p><p>The Chaos Trio exchange glances.</p><p>Chaka clears his throat. “We were just heading back anyway.” He grabs his empty cup, nudging Shime with his elbow. “Right?”</p><p>“Right, right.” Shime hops off his perch. “Later, Kyomo.”</p><p>Taiga watches them file out, Machu throwing an apologetic look over his shoulder. The pantry feels bigger without their energy filling it, though not necessarily quieter—the coffee machine whirs to life as Wakana starts making her drink.</p><p>Hokuto moves to stand beside Taiga at the second machine, laptop tucked under one arm. Up close, Taiga notices the shadows under his eyes, the slight wrinkle in his otherwise crisp shirt. Their arms almost brush as Hokuto reaches for a cup.</p><p>“Sorry,” Taiga mutters, stepping aside to give him space. The coffee machine counter isn’t particularly wide, and they do this awkward dance of elbows and mugs until Taiga manages to grab the milk.</p><p>Hokuto’s lips curve in a small smile. “Thanks.” His voice is soft, barely audible over the machine’s grinding.</p><p>Taiga nods, focusing on stirring his coffee rather than the way Hokuto’s presence seems to fill the small space between them. He’s worked with Hokuto for over a year now, but their interactions have always been limited to polite greetings and the occasional project meeting. The development team keeps to themselves mostly, and Hokuto especially seems content with that arrangement.</p><p>Noel sidles closer to the window, gesturing for Taiga to follow. The afternoon sun warms their backs as they lean against the sill, keeping a respectful distance from Wakana and Hokuto’s hushed conversation by the coffee machines.</p><p>“How’s the new place treating you?” Noel’s voice is low, matching the quiet atmosphere.</p><p>Taiga takes a sip of his coffee, letting the bitter warmth spread through him. Of all his coworkers, Noel is the easiest to talk to—no prying questions or excessive enthusiasm like the Chaos Trio, just calm interest and the occasional dry observation.</p><p>“It’s peaceful.” <em>When my father isn’t calling</em>, he adds silently. “The smart home setup is working better than expected.”</p><p>“No regrets about the location?”</p><p>“None. The commute’s reasonable and—”</p><p>“I understand the deadline pressure,” Wakana’s voice carries across the pantry, “but we need those features thoroughly tested before—”</p><p>“I can’t stay late tonight,” Hokuto interrupts, his usual soft tone firm. “Or this week actually.”</p><p>Wakana sighs. “Right, of course. Ema-chan’s preschool schedule. I should have remembered.”</p><p>Taiga’s ears prick at the unfamiliar name. He pretends to study his coffee cup as Wakana and Hokuto gather their things and head out, their footsteps fading down the hallway.</p><p><em>That explains it</em>.</p><p>Hokuto’s clockwork departures at 5 PM sharp, regardless of project deadlines or team meetings. Taiga had noticed it before—hard not to when everyone else was pulling late hours during crunch time. He vaguely remembers Machu mentioning something about Hokuto having a kid, though he hadn’t paid much attention at the time.</p><p>“You’re thinking awfully hard about something,” Noel observes.</p><p>“Just…” Taiga swirls his coffee. “Matsumura can’t be much older than us, right? And he already has a kid.”</p><p>Noel’s laugh is quiet but genuine. “Now you sound like the Chaos Trio. Should I expect gossip theories next?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Heat creeps up Taiga’s neck. “I was just surprised.”</p><p>“Anyway, we should head back.” Noel pushes off from the window. “These reports won’t analyze themselves.”</p><p>Noel leads the way back, weaving between desks and cubicles. The afternoon sun slants through the windows, casting long shadows across the office floor. Taiga’s mind drifts to the engagement metrics waiting on his screen, already planning which variables to adjust—</p><p>“Kyomoto-san!”</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Jesse Lewis stands by Taiga’s desk, his million-dollar smile gleaming under the fluorescent lights. He’s dressed casually today—or what passes for casual when you’re the face of multiple luxury brands. The sleeves of his designer hoodie are pushed up to reveal a watch that probably costs more than what Taiga paid for his new house.</p><p>Noel shoots Taiga a sympathetic look before retreating to his own desk.</p><p>
  <em>Traitor.</em>
</p><p>“Hey.” Taiga clutches his coffee cup tighter. “How are you?”</p><p>“Missing you already.” Jesse’s eyes sparkle with mischief. “Can’t believe it’s been a whole day since lunch.”</p><p>A blush crawls along Taiga’s throat. “Right. Yesterday.” He moves to his desk, hoping the physical barrier will help maintain some professional distance. “I don’t think we have any marketing meetings scheduled today?”</p><p>“Oh, no meetings.” Jesse follows, perching on the edge of Taiga’s desk like he belongs there. His cologne—something expensive and woody—drifts between them. “I’m here to see you, actually.”</p><p><em>Of course you are</em>. Taiga takes a long sip of coffee, buying time.</p><p>Through the glass walls of Minagawa’s office, he can see his boss watching with undisguised interest. Great. Just what he needs—more office gossip fodder.</p><p>“Listen.” Jesse leans in, lowering his voice conspiratorially. “There’s this amazing winter exhibit opening at Tokyo Skytree on Friday. Very exclusive, very romantic.” He winks. “I’ve got two tickets, and I’d love for you to join me.”</p><p>The invitation hangs in the air between them. Taiga’s stomach twists. Jesse’s attention feels suffocating, like being trapped in an elevator with too much perfume.</p><p>“I’m sure you’ve got plenty of celebrity friends who’d enjoy that more than me.”</p><p>“But I want to go with you.” Jesse’s smile turns softer, almost vulnerable.</p><p>The sincerity in his voice makes it worse somehow. It would be easier if he was just another entitled celebrity throwing his weight around.</p><p>Taiga's mind races through his options, each one worse than the last. Declining outright could jeopardize the endorsement deal—Jesse’s the type to take rejection personally. Lying about dating someone would spread through the office faster than a computer virus, and he’s already used every excuse in his calendar.</p><p>Jesse shifts closer, his thigh now pressing against Taiga’s mouse pad. The wood of the desk creaks slightly. “Come on, what do you say? I promise it’ll be fun.”</p><p><em>Like a root canal would be fun.</em> Taiga opens his mouth, still unsure what will come out—</p><p>“Kyomoto-san.” Hokuto’s quiet voice cuts through the tension. “Do you have a moment? There’s something I wanted to ask about the user engagement data.”</p><p>Taiga’s head snaps up. Hokuto stands a few feet away, laptop tucked under his arm, expression neutral. The fluorescent lights catch the shadows under his eyes.</p><p>Jesse straightens, his smile dimming slightly. “Oh, work stuff? I can wait.”</p><p>“Actually,” Hokuto says, “it’s rather urgent. The development team needs this information for our next sprint planning.”</p><p>Relief floods through Taiga's system. “Right, of course.” He turns to Jesse, trying to keep his voice professional. “Sorry, but this sounds important.”</p><p>“No worries, no worries.” Jesse’s laugh is a bit too loud, a bit too forced. He pulls out his phone, tapping quickly. “Here, let me give you my personal number. For the exhibit, you know? Think about it?”</p><p>Taiga’s phone buzzes with the incoming contact.</p><p>Jesse finally steps away from the desk, his cologne lingering in the air. “I’ll see you around, Kyomoto-san.” His smile returns to its usual wattage. “Nice meeting you...” He trails off, looking at Hokuto expectantly.</p><p>“Matsumura.” Hokuto supplies quietly.</p><p>“Right, right. Later!” Jesse waves as he heads toward the elevator, several heads turning to watch him go.</p><p>Taiga slumps in his chair. “Thanks. You’re a lifesaver.”</p><p>Hokuto blinks. “Sorry?”</p><p>“For the interruption. Perfect timing.”</p><p>“Oh.” Hokuto shifts his weight, adjusting his grip on his laptop. “I actually do need to discuss the engagement metrics. For the new feature rollout?”</p><p><em>Of course he wasn’t trying to help.</em> “Right, yeah. What did you want to know?”</p><p>“The drop-off rate after the third notification—is that consistent across all user segments?”</p><p>Taiga pulls up the spreadsheet, grateful for the chance to focus on something concrete. Numbers don’t try to ask him out or corner him at his desk. “Let me show you the breakdown.”</p><p>As their conversation progresses, Hokuto leans over Taiga’s desk, his brow furrowed as he studies the data on the screen. The warmth of his presence feels oddly intrusive in Taiga’s carefully maintained personal space. Jesse’s cologne still lingers in the air, mixing uncomfortably with the scent of fresh coffee and whatever subtle soap Hokuto uses.</p><p>“So if we look at the age demographics”—Taiga points to a specific cell, trying to focus on the task at hand,—“you’ll see the drop-off is most significant in the 35-50 range.”</p><p>Hokuto nods, but his fingers drum against his laptop. His eyes keep darting to his watch, the motion subtle but unmistakable. The afternoon sun has shifted, casting longer shadows across their faces.</p><p>Taiga glances at his screen: 4:47 PM. <em>Right. The preschool schedule</em>. The conversation from the pantry echoes in his mind—Hokuto’s firm tone when telling Wakana he couldn’t stay late.</p><p>“Listen”—Taiga minimizes the spreadsheet—“I can put this data in an email. Make it easier to reference during your sprint planning.”</p><p>Relief flashes across Hokuto’s face, quick but unmistakable. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Taiga waves off the concern. “I need to clean up these numbers anyway before presenting them to Matsumoto-buchou.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Hokuto straightens, already reaching for his bag. “I’ll send you some follow-up questions tonight, if that’s okay?”</p><p>“Sure, whenever.”</p><p>Hokuto returns to his desk with quick, efficient movements. His monitor goes dark, his laptop disappears into his messenger bag, and his desk transforms from organized to pristine in under two minutes. The practiced routine of someone who’s mastered the art of the swift exit.</p><p>A chorus of “Good work today!” rises from the development team as Hokuto waves goodbye. He bows slightly, offering quiet thanks before heading to the elevator.</p><p>Taiga turns back to his screen, but his eyes keep drifting to the empty desk across the floor.</p><p>The coffee in his mug has gone cold.</p>
