<h2 class="toc-heading">won’t you come with me and spend the night?</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Hokuto feels like a fucking loser. And you know what? He probably is. He’s standing in this club, completely out of his element, sticking out like a sore thumb where he stood awkwardly, drink in his hand as he takes a sip nervously, only to gag silently remembering the bitterness of the alcohol in his cup. He can’t find Juri anymore, he’s probably busy sucking face with someone and Hokuto can’t be bothered to find him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hokuto?” A voice— a very familiar one, calls out to him from behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling his shoulders stiffen awkwardly, he turns around slowly to meet the eyes of the one person he had been actively avoiding for the past three weeks, “Meme!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His voice comes out strained, pained, almost. Hokuto was very dramatic, and he knew that, that’s why he was an actor. But this was very much real to him and for him. It all started as a silly joke back in their Jr days, Hokuto was smashed, they were celebrating their debut announcement, Meguro was the token sober friend that night. Taiga makes an offhand joke about how Hokuto acted like he was in love with Meguro when he was drunk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just a joke. But Hokuto took it seriously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To say that things got different from then wouldn’t really be true. Hokuto and Meguro hardly crossed paths despite being under the same company and having the same debut day. He would’ve reached out to Meguro more if he didn’t see how much their fans fought online, he found it funny most of the time, wondering if these fans knew about his feelings, would their opinions change? Or would they not put to rest the (now) silent civil war between each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, on the occasion that Hokuto did cross paths with Meguro, he could hardly get a word out. That was an exaggeration, of course, Hokuto just didn’t like admitting how flustered he got around the younger man, it was almost laughable. And it was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His ‘suffering’, as he likes to call it, was now a source of daily entertainment for the SixTONES groupchat. At least once a day he’d be texting his members only to have someone randomly (it’s always Shintaro) bring up how Hokuto hasn’t talked to Meguro, or how he ‘has no bitches’. That would then lead to everyone bringing up how they could talk to the Aquarius easily, and Hokuto has to sit there sulking. Not that he was upset, he was above getting sad over jokes, but it really did put into perspective how… Loser-ish, it was of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Meguro flashes him a faint smile that Hokuto swears makes him melt inside to the point that he just spaces out looking at the man before him. That is, before Meguro ends up waving a hand in front of his face that snaps him out of his lovesick gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, uh, absolutely,” Hokuto hopes his answer is enough to make Meguro think he was listening, but when he sees the younger man chuckle, all he feels is that familiar burn in his cheeks, “Sorry, uhm, I’m a bit tipsy,” It’s a lie, but Meguro seems to believe it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, shame, I wanted to get you something, it’s not often that I see you,” Hokuto immediately shakes his head, throwing out his prior nervousness out of the window for a moment with this enigmatic man. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t mind getting smashed by you,” Hokuto almost screams at himself mentally, how did he fuck up that badly? “I mean</span>
<em>
<span> with </span>
</em>
<span>you! I wouldn’t mind getting </span>
<em>
<span>drunk </span>
</em>
<span>with you! God, sorry, must be more tipsy than I realise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro’s eyes flew open in surprise, he wasn’t expecting that slip up, but he also can’t help the swirl of amusement in him. Emboldened by the alcohol coursing through his system, he leans forward with a faint smirk, keeping his eyes on the nervous man before him, “You know, they say drunk words are usually the thoughts we keep to ourselves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto feels like his skin is on fire and he thanks the dim lights of the club from hiding the flush in his cheeks, but with the way his mouth opens and closes bashfully, he’s sure he’s not hiding much, “It’s just– uhm– a typo- I mean, a slip up, nothing at all…” Hokuto doesn't understand why he’s lying when he’s done nothing to quell his attraction, but maybe it’s pride, or his inability to admit things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really?” Meguro knows better than to push, but he couldn’t help but remember how he had overheard Shota and Juri talking a while back, how Hokuto was being ‘ridiculous’ about avoiding him, and how he should just talk to him. Meguro may have been a bit slow, but he wasn’t stupid, he knew he was attractive, knew people flocked to him like a moth to a flame. So, naturally, he knew Hokuto was hooked. And he couldn’t even lie, he was hooked too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, really,” Hokuto murmurs a bit too softly that not even he could hear himself over the blaring music of the club, so, of course, Meguro takes this as another chance to tease him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger leans in a bit too close for comfort, eyes flickering down to Hokuto’s lips and back to his eyes, “Hm? What’s that? I don’t think I caught that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If this was what Hokuto knew he was getting himself into being dragged to some shitty club with Juri, he would’ve said no, but since he was here, well, better to face the music than cower away with his tail tucked between his legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Downing the cup of, whatever the hell was inside, he swallows the bitter alcohol and meets Meguro’s eyes squarely, “I said, yes, really. Happy?” Hokuto doesn’t know where this snappiness comes from, but he knew deep down his words held no real malice. No, if Meguro could try to tease him (successfully too) he could try to see how far that pretty mouth goes. And honestly, what did Hokuto have to lose anyway?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Noting the lippiness in his tone, Meguro could only pull back with a soft scoff. He could live without getting what he wanted, but something about the night made him desperate— he wanted Hokuto, for the night, for the next day, for the next week, for the next month. You got the gist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a playful pout, Meguro leans against the wall next to them, he takes a sip of his drink, keeping his eyes on Hokuto over the rim of his cup. It seemed Hokuto wasn’t going to let up, alright, that’s fine, they had all night. Settling his cup down, he leans in closer again, lips merely inches from Hokuto’s ear, “Come on, don’t play coy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto feels a shiver run down his spine when he feels Meguro’s breath tickle the shell of his ear. It was all he ever dreamed of, all his desires centered around Meguro, but yet, he wanted to ‘play coy’, just like Meguro said. So, he turns his gaze back to him with a sly smile, “Hm? Whatever do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro can only let out a low chuckle in response before taking another sip of his drink to suppress the desire running rampant in him, “Let’s just say Shoppi isn’t the most quiet person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And there it is, Hokuto’s subtly widened eyes and flushed cheeks Meguro knew wasn’t from the alcohol. He watches the way Hokuto’s eyes trail away, was it that easy to get him flustered? Maybe just his mere presence could get him all bashful and blushing. Meguro found it adorable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, my place isn’t that far from here,” Meguro whispers again, purposely getting closer to let his lips brush Hokuto’s ear, eliciting a sweet whimper from the older man, “Spend the night with me, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>How could he possibly say no to the man he’s been desperately pining over, and hey, maybe it would be better than late nights with his hand urgently pumping at his aching length thinking about the curve of Meguro’s arms and low voice. But really, Hokuto wasn’t going to admit that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm…” Hokuto hums teasingly, knowing that Meguro was growing impatient. Eventually, he lets up, running his fingers up Meguro’s arm, “Lead the way then, pretty boy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro could practically hear his heart in his ears, he was sure Hokuto would attempt to push him more, but it seems that he was wrong after all and he wasn’t really complaining. With a grin, he grabs Hokuto’s arm and pushes through the bodies of people in the club before finally making it out onto the alleyway littered with fluorescent signs over bars and clubs. Meguro’s set on one goal and one goal only, getting back to his place and getting to feeling this beautiful man’s skin beneath his palms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto doesn’t know why he relents so quickly– actually, that’s a lie, he knows very well why, he’s just in denial that his crush on this man really went that deep that he was swayed by a few whispers. But there’s something almost electrifying about this, about the feeling of Meguro’s hand in his as they hurriedly walked in the direction of the younger’s apartment building. Hokuto didn’t want to say he was impatient when really, he was, but God, was he aching to just get to the end knowing where this was going to go. Maybe it was the alcohol making him tipsy that he was acting like this, or maybe he’s just infested with horniness because of this man, all he knew is that he needed him and now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they step into the lift, Hokuto can hardly contain himself before he’s pushing Meguro up against the steel walls, lips desperately catching with the younger’s as he greedily nibbles at his bottom lip. The kiss is more teeth than anything, it was more hunger than tender, and Meguro wasn’t mad, he returned the kiss with equal fervor, almost trying to consume Hokuto whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro’s hands slide down Hokuto’s body, finding themselves at his hips before pulling him flushed against his chest, unable to resist the urge to slide back to playfully grip at Hokuto’s ass, making the older gasp softly before shooting him a glare, “I’m just kidding,” Meguro muses breathlessly, returning back to claim Hokuto’s lips entirely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator dings and they reluctantly pull away, catching their breaths before hurrying to get into Meguro’s apartment and pick up where they left off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With urgent hands, Meguro keys in his pin and steps into his apartment, Hokuto following behind. In typical Asian fashion, they kick off their shoes at the door first before Meguro practically grabs Hokuto, pulling him towards the couch where he leans him down, hovering over the bewildered man as he captures his lips again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s more passionate this time, almost like Meguro was diffusing his emotions into him, emotions he hadn’t really recognised much since that fateful day at the award show with Hokuto. Sure, Hokuto looked gorgeous all dolled up with hair slicked back— but Meguro thinks he likes him more now, whining and flushed, desperate for his touch like a dog. It’s so incredibly enticing, Meguro can’t help the low groan that rumbles in his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His hand trails under the measly shirt separating Hokuto’s delicate body from Meguro’s prying eyes, each touch felt like fire on the older’s skin, making him spiral into a dizzying abyss of pleasure from such a simple touch. Meguro’s lips trail down to his jaw, peppering light kisses onto his skin, relishing every silent shudder that leaves Hokuto’s pretty lips. His hand finds itself at Hokuto’s chest, nipples perked in arousal. That was hardly the only thing perked up in arousal, though, but Meguro wanted to tease him a little more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With deft fingers, Meguro takes a nipple between his index finger and thumb, rolling it between them as Hokuto lets out a series of whimpers that makes Meguro’s eyes roll back from how sweet they sounded to his ears, “So you’re sensitive here, good to know,” Meguro mutters against Hokuto’s neck before leaving gentle nibbles behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to kill me,” Hokuto whines breathlessly, his brain practically mush in his skull at this point as his hips buck up against Meguro’s pelvis, rubbing against him in a desperate need for some friction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro noticed what Hokuto’s doing, and with a free hand, he grips at the older’s hips, grounding it against the couch before pulling back to meet his eyes. Meguro scans his face with pride, knowing he was able to get this enigmatic man all flushed and panting from just his touch, it almost makes him dizzy thinking about just how Hokuto would look with his cock buried deep in his ass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger picks him up with ease, hands holding his thighs as he carries him over to his bedroom, lips finding themselves at Hokuto’s neck again, taking in his scent between open mouth kisses against his sensitive skin. Meguro can’t help it, Hokuto’s skin felt like silk beneath his hands, he needed more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tossing him down onto the bed, Meguro climbs over him, hands pinning Hokuto’s wrists down onto the sheets before latching their lips together again for another hungry kiss. This time, he carefully slides his knee between Hokuto’s parted legs, eventually stopping at where his bulge was and Meguro smirks into the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, he presses his knee against Hokuto’s clothed erection, rubbing it slowly as he pulls away from the kiss to watch the way the way the moans spill from Hokuto’s lips with ease, eyebrows quirking together in pleasure as his hips move against Meguro’s knee, wanting, </span>
<em>
<span>needing</span>
</em>
<span>, more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so impatient,” Meguro chuckles lowly before leaning closer to Hokuto’s flushed ears, “Just how long have you been dreaming of this, baby?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s mind is so dizzy with pleasure, all he can do is make out a small ‘so long’ as he chases his high from… Meguro’s knee. In a way, it was pretty embarrassing just how needy he was for release from Meguro that he was getting off on his knee of all things. But that shame is quickly buried away as he feels his cock begin to twitch and his movements grow more faster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro knows he’s close, and while he so badly wanted to give him that, he just wanted to drag on a little more. So, he ignores the whine that leaves Hokuto’s lips when he pulls his leg away, only for it to turn into a gasp when Meguro pulls his pants off along with his boxers, leaking length springing out for Meguro’s lustful eyes. With a shit eating grin, Meguro slowly goes to undo his own pants, letting it drop down to his ankles, keeping his eyes on Hokuto’s desperate ones. He slides his boxers down, letting it pool at  the floor beneath him before crawling back onto bed with Hokuto.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Returning his lips back to Hokuto’s sensitive neck, his hand trailing down till his fingers find themselves right at Hokuto’s puckered hole, causing the older to let out the faintest whimper, cock twitching in response. Meguro brings his fingers to his lips, coating his digits with his saliva before sliding back between their bodies. Slowly, he pressed his middle and ring finger against Hokuto’s ass hole, slowly sinking them in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto feels his eyes roll back, letting out a shaky breath as his length twitched, hips bucking against the air with his hands gripping at Meguro’s shoulders when the latter’s fingers press against his prostate, low moan erupting from his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro slowly began to move his fingers, leaning back to study Hokuto’s flushed face for any discomfort. Sure, he wanted to fuck him, but he didn’t want him to be in any pain, that’s for sure. His lips slowly curved into a proud smirk, fingers picking up the pace while curling them ever so often, watching Hokuto gasp out delicate moans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unable to take it anymore, Meguro slides his fingers out and positions himself between Hokuto’s legs, holding his cock in his hands as he positions the tip right in front of the older’s prepped entrance, “Are you ready?” Meguro asks gently, stark contrast to his actions, that it makes Hokuto’s heart flutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please, Meme,” Hokuto pleads softly, spreadkng his legs a little more for the man over him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a nod, Meguro gently pushes into Hokuto, allowing him to adjust to his size while watching with a sense of satisfaction as the latter’s eyes roll back into his head. Hokuto swears his body is on fire, in the best way possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sheathed all the way in, Hokuto pants softly, eyes fluttering fighting to stay open as he looks up at Meguro, his gaze so tender it makes Hokuto want to cry, “Are you okay?” Meguro reaches down to brush a strand of hair away from Hokuto’s forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you’re perfect,” Hokuto breathes out with a gentle chuckle, steeling his body from the stretch. He reaches up to wrap his arms around Meguro’s shoulders to support himself, “You can move now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gulping thickly, Meguro begins to set a slow pace to start, making sure to not cause Hokuto any discomfort, but his moans are like music to his ears, he almost wants to go faster to hear more of it. But he steels himself, telling himself to focus on Hokuto’s pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything felt </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>right, Hokuto could barely believe that after years of pining over this man, here he was, in his bed, with his dick causing pleasure to course through him, so intimately connected like Hokuto had always dreamed. Hokuto felt his body begin to warm up as Meguro picked up the pace, causing him to see stars from the sheer satisfaction he felt, barely holding back his moans as he buried his face in Meguro’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro held Hokuto like he was glass in his hands, so afraid of hurting him, of shattering him, unless that’s what Hokuto wanted— to be broken by him, then he would happily oblige, but he was so focused on Hokuto his own pleasure just came secondary. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Beginning to feel that familiar tightness in his abdomen, Meguro knew his release was imminent. He stopped for a second, shifting around till he was sitting at the edge of the bed with Hokuto on his lap, bodies still connected, “Keep looking at me, please,” Meguro begs softly, his hands at the small of Hokuto’s back to keep him steady.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obliging, Hokuto looks into Meguro’s lovesick eyes and he feels a pang of realisation hit him. This wasn’t some one night stand to Meguro— this meant the same thing to him as it did to Hokuto. With a fluttering heart, he leans down to capture Meguro’s lips in a heated kiss as the younger began to thrust into him again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro, Meguro, Meguro. Hokuto repeats his name in his head like a prayer, he didn’t think he was that in love with this man, but he guessed realisations came harder when you’re in denial. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto’s cock began to twitch, signaling his impending orgasm and he pulls away from the kiss, looking deeply into Meguro’s eyes with so much affection it was practically oozing out of his pores, “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro’s mind is so dazed out, but he catches those three words almost immediately, causing his heart to hammer against his chest. Thrusting more urgently and eagerly, he leans his forehead against Hokuto’s, “I love you too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And with that, the two erupted into a cacophony of guttural moans, Hokuto’s cock slaps against his abdomen, ropes of cum staining his chest as Meguro buries himself deep in Hokuto’s ass, seed dripping out slowly as they stay connected for a while, basking in the afterglow while holding each other close. Meguro can’t remember the last time he’s ever felt so alive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pulling out slowly with a groan, Meguro’s dick laid limp as Hokuto rested his head against his shoulder, catching their breaths from the intensity of their connection. Time seems to stand still, Meguro burying his face deep in Hokuto’s neck to take in his scent, nuzzling his nose against his skin as he holds him impossibly close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto can only lazily wrap his arms around Meguro’s waist, body completely spent and exhausted, but he manages to make out a tired smile, fingers trailing patterns around Meguro’s back until he realises something— for all the pleasure he felt, he </span>
<em>
<span>just </span>
</em>
<span>now caught onto the fact that Meguro said he loved him back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pulling away with eyes wide in shock, Meguro looks back at him in confusion which turns to panic, oh fuck, did Hokuto regret it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong?” Meguro asks, trying to mask his worry with even more confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love me too?” Hokuto sputters out in disbelief. Well, technically, he should’ve seen it coming with the way Meguro looked at him, but it hits him harder now that he was in a right state of mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro feels a wave of relief wash over him which quickly turns to shyness, he turns away from Hokuto’s gaze with his hand rubbing at his nape, “Well, yeah… I mean, I kinda like you too, y’know? I don’t just sleep with anyone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hokuto feels his heart begin to pick up it’s pace again, causing the heat in his cheeks to rise up again, “Why didn’t you say anything! I’ve been in love with you this whole time, idiot!” For all his snappiness, Hokuto couldn’t help but feel relieved his love was reciprocated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger only chuckles before leaning back on his palms to look up at the man still seated on his lap, “Well, now we know,” Meguro can’t help himself from admiring Hokuto for a bit despite his pouting face, still though, he found him incredibly endearing, “I really do love you, Hokuto.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flushing even deeper, Hokuto turns away, still though, he doesn’t know what he’s done to get so lucky to have </span>
<em>
<span>the </span>
</em>
<span>Meguro Ren to love him back, but he isn’t really complaining.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does this mean you’re mine now?” Hokuto murmurs shyly, refusing to speak any louder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if you want me to be,” Meguro reaches up to brush his fingers through Hokuto’s hair, smile playing at his lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course I want you to be,” Hokuto replies back almost immediately as his lips find their way back to Meguro’s again, this time, savouring his lips against his in all its entirety. It felt so much more different now that Meguro was his, and it couldn’t have felt better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meguro smiles into the kiss, deepening it as he leans in closer to this man who captured his heart with one glance. He was so in love, so irrevocably in love and he never wanted it to end. He rolls Hokuto back onto the bed, hovering over him as he looks down at the older’s confused expression, “What? Can’t handle another round?” Meguro teases before leaning in to press a kiss to Hokuto’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Meme!”</span>
