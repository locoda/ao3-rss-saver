      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>For years the West Center had thought their biggest enemy were Myuto and the Fallen following him. After they had succeeded in getting Aran on their side and make a Reverse serum to turn the Fallen DNA into a new mutation, which allowed them to keep their Fallen abilities and strength, but freed them from the emotionless mind set of the survival of the fittest, the West Center had falsely though that they could move on into a new era without Vestige and Fallen trying to kill each other while the ultimate mistake lay at the Government not taking responsibility for their own impropriate illegal DNA mutation research.<br/>For Taiga and Hokuto a new fight had started with the destruction of the East Center and while they now needed to try to protect their own Center they would eventually have to sacrifice more than they were willing to!</p></blockquote>

  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>Just remembering Taisuke's dangerous glare, his unbeatable copy ability, a speed and strength not even Myuto could stand up against, was too much for Taiga to even be able to think about any plan how they could ever be able to face Taisuke together with the other Fallen he had gathered.</p><p>"Didn't you say your healing ability would make them recover faster?"</p><p>Hokuto's voice. So at least he was safe and they were most likely back at their Center, because the next voice he heard was from Shime.</p><p>"Physically I can heal them faster than our abilities can, but I can't repair mental damage, so after such a fight I guess they all need some more time to get up."</p><p>Which meant as much as Kentaro and Myuto were most likely also still unconscious.</p><p>Feeling the pressure of Hokuto's hand closing around his, Taiga finally fought himself out of all the dark thoughts and he squeezed the other one's hand back.</p><p>"Are you awake?"</p><p>The worried tone made Taiga smile faintly at him when he opened his eyes before he nodded. "Are we at the West Center?"</p><p>"Yes, we got some unexpected help in the end."</p><p>Hokuto explained while Taiga scanned the room. It was their medical station and he could spot Myuto and Kentaro on other beds, with Reo sitting next to Kentaro with a dark expression.</p><p>"You should be okay to get up and walk around," Shime said.  "I have a healing ability so your physical wounds are all good."</p><p>"How about Myuto?"</p><p>"He'll be fine, but just a bit later and maybe even I wouldn't have been able to rescue him," Shime explained with a gloomy expression. "I'm sorry that you had to face Taisuke like this without any warning."</p><p>"It's not like that is your fault," Taiga let out, but then he saw the way Hokuto's expression changed.</p><p>"Is there something I don't know?"</p><p>Shime shifted a bit uncomfortable next to the bed before he bowed apologizing towards Taiga who didn't even know what was going on.</p><p>"I should have said something earlier, but with Myuto and the others around and the focus on the Reverse serum I wanted to wait until I've seen the results."</p><p>"Wait with what?" Taiga asked curiously yet a bit terrified by the way the boy looked so scared.</p><p>"Taisuke is my older brother."</p><p>The missing reaction from Hokuto and also from Reo meant that they had already been told, but Taiga didn't even know what to do with that information.</p><p>"Okay... Thanks for telling us, I guess?" Taiga said a bit lost.</p><p>"You're not angry?"</p><p>"Were they angry?" Taiga asked and pointed at the others, but as expected Shime shook his head.</p><p>"You are not at fault for what your brother does as a Fallen. Not even your brother himself is at fault for that, because he is after all a Fallen and not in control of his emotions."</p><p>The explanation made sense, yet Shime didn't seem to feel better.</p><p>"Where are the others?" Taiga asked instead and Hokuto got up.</p><p>"Let's go meet them. As Shime said you should be fine getting up and Reo promised to have a look at Kentaro and Myuto until they wake up."</p><p>Taiga nodded and got up, relieved to not feel tired or unstable on his feet.</p><p>Shime left together with them, but instead of the lab, they left for the training room.</p><p>"Moro, Hagi and Yuma are in the special Fallen room, waiting for Myuto to wake up. Just then they will agree to get the serum."</p><p>It sounded fair and while Taiga wanted them to feel safe while doing the transition he felt a sudden urge to rush them, because they couldn't stand a chance against Taisuke. But would numbers even matter?</p><p>Sudden loud noises from the training room made Taiga look up at the glass and he found a handful of unknown faces together with Juri, Shintaro and Jesse.</p><p>"Aran and Kochi are in the lab at the moment. They try to improve the serum, so we can go later and talk to them," Hokuto added before he entered the training room.</p><p>“I guess Aran is trying to distract himself instead of sitting next to Myuto and worry,” Taiga realized, but he couldn’t blame him.</p><p>"Taiga, you're awake! How are you feeling?" Jesse asked and hugged him before even waiting for a reply if he was still hurt.</p><p>"All good, no need to worry."</p><p>"This is definitely the most messed up situation we've been in so far," Shintaro added.</p><p>"Are they…?"</p><p>"The ones who helped you yes," Juri explained while Taiga hurried to walk up to the six boys in front of him and bowed.</p><p>"Thank you for your help. I fear without you none of us would have survived."</p><p>One of them laughed and shook his head, but he didn't get up from the ground where he was sitting, leaning to the back instead. "Trust me if Taisuke wanted to kill you then you'd be dead, us most likely as well."</p><p>Unfortunately Taiga had guessed that already, but he didn't want to say it out loud.</p><p>"So you are the Fallen in control of his senses we heard about?" Another one of them asked, scanning Taiga from head to toe with an intense stare.</p><p>Taiga looked a bit worried towards Hokuto, but he also didn't know how they had gotten that information.</p><p>"Let me explain a bit before this gets too complicated," Shime offered and walked up to the other boys. He stopped next to the boy sitting on the ground and who had spoken up first. He had curly black hair, which was already so long that it was hard to see his eyes when he was sitting. “This is Nakamura Kaito. He is a Chaser from the South Center.” The boy just lifted his hand, not bothering with getting up and introducing himself. Not to forget that details had to wait for later. They had a dangerous enemy right in front of their doors and who knew if Taisuke wasn’t planning another attack already.</p><p>Shime stopped next to the boy who had spoken next and put his hand on his shoulder. The boy was the tallest of them all and he had a little bit longer straight black hair. “This is Kawashima Noel. He is the ace of the Chasers in the Main Center.”</p><p>“Now I would have loved to see him compete against Taiga when he was still a Chaser,” Shintaro whispered, but Noel just cracked a smile.</p><p>Shime kept going and pointed at a boy at his left who had red curly hair and a sheepish smile on his lips. “Matsukura Kaito, a Vestige from the Main Center.”</p><p>“Do you have any special abilities?” Juri asked, but the boy shook his head.</p><p>“Wait two of you are called Kaito? This is going to be confusing,” Jesse interfered.</p><p>“Then what would you do if I told you my name was also Kaito?” One of the other boys with slightly wavy black hair said with a teasing smile as he got up and bowed slightly to the others. “My name is Miyachika Kaito. I am a Chaser from the East Center.” </p><p>Shime walked up to him and patted his shoulder. “You can call him Chaka and the other two Matsuku and Umi.”</p><p>“I already have a headache,” Shintaro let out, but with so many new people it was normal that they needed some time to remember everyone in the first place.</p><p>“Our youngest member is Yoshizawa Shizuya, a Chaser from the North Center,” Shime added and pointed at the boy with short black hair and slightly chubby cheeks.</p><p>“And definitely the worst Chaser you have ever seen,” the last boy spoke making Shizu seem slightly embarrassed. “But he puts a lot of passion into his job.”</p><p>Now Shizu seemed even more embarrassed, but Shime pulled everyone’s attention back to the remaining boy. “This is Matsuda Genta from the North Center and he is a Vestige. He is the strongest Vestige in our team.”</p><p>“Is he stronger than Myuto?” Taiga asked and the boy with the dark gray hair nodded.</p><p>“My special ability is to be able to attack with ten times my strength, but of course I need a long recharge time and it only works for a few seconds. I can hold someone down or put enough strength into my grip to even crush bones, but of course Taisuke stays unaffected even by that ability.”</p><p> “Wait, you are all from different Centers, some of you Vestige, others Chasers. What is your connection?” Shintaro asked and then pointed at Chaka. “And why weren’t you at the East Center attack right from the start?”</p><p>The boys all exchanged a troubled expression for a moment before it was Taiga who caught up to the situation first. “You are all connected to Taisuke.”</p><p>“More or less, yes,” Shime explained. “The same as Myuto, Taisuke gathered other Fallen around him, but he didn’t do so to rescue them from the Government. All he wanted was to gather the most skilled Fallen to be able to eventually strike back at the Capitol.”</p><p>“So the Fallen he gathered are connected to the other boys,” Juri said. “Well those details can wait for later I think. For now we need as much information about Taisuke and the other Fallen as we can get.”</p><p>“All of us stood in contact all this time,” Shime started. “We only clashed once with Taisuke and the others, since then they had retreated so far away from the city that we couldn’t find them anymore. When the attack at the East Center happened, Chaka was out with a few Chasers and two Vestige. So luckily he was able to contact us.”</p><p>“That’s why you all came as backup,” Hokuto concluded.</p><p>“You guys gave Taisuke a tough challenge. But you have to think again if you really want to join us against them,” Genta said. “Taisuke likes playing around, but we all had trouble with just him, now imagine him coming with the others.”</p><p>“By then we will luckily have three more Fallen on our side,” Juri said, but he still seemed skeptical as well after all even Myuto and Kentaro hadn’t stood a chance.</p><p>“Taisuke will be a threat to all Centers from now on, so there is no way we will stay back,” Taiga explained.</p><p>“I am really glad to hear that,” Shime said and walked up to Taiga and Hokuto. “I have another request if you are both okay with it.”</p><p>The two boys exchanged a look and nodded before Shime stepped even closer. “To make things easier could you read my mind and show the information to all the other members? Like that we will speed up the explanation part a lot.”</p><p>Shime had a good point there and Hokuto moved first putting his hand on the boy’s temple, before Taiga moved his hand to the other side of the boy’s head.</p><p>“Please don’t hold back. I won’t keep any secrets from you.”</p><p>How much had the boy suffered until now through his brother being a Fallen? Taiga had suffered a lot after finding Myuto as a Fallen and here Shime was a Vestige and still couldn’t get close to his brother as he had turned out to be the strongest Fallen they had ever encountered.</p><p>Hokuto wouldn’t be able to share the memories he would receive, yet he could at least receive them directly so Taiga didn’t need to waste time with transferring them to him and as soon as Myuto was awake again he could help as well.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 24 - October</strong>
</p><p>“What do you mean you want to take part in the trial?” Shime asked perplexed, but Taisuke already put his clothes in his bag.</p><p>“What else can I do? We have been losing this war for years now. Daily I see people die. People who have nothing to do with this, friends who fight right next to me. Don’t you want this to end?”</p><p>Of course Shime wanted the war to end, but he also didn’t want to lose his brother. Every single day he left on another mission from the Government he worried sick until he finally walked back through the door. As a family of soldiers, their father had died in the war already and their mum had also lost her life as a nurse on the front line. But while Shime was only helping out inside the bases, Taisuke was on the front line. A pilot, away from him for weeks sometimes and while they had already said that resources got tight and they would soon not be able to fly over the border anymore, that day had not arrived yet. And the thought of him never coming back from one of those missions made Shime emotionally unstable and sometimes he couldn’t even get up in the morning without getting a mental breakdown.</p><p>“I promise to update you as often as I can, okay?” Taisuke said as he walked up to his little brother and put his hand on his cheek with one of his bright smiles. A smile he didn’t see often anymore as the sorrow of the loss of their parents and the ongoing stress of the war was now mainly seen in his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“You know that I will storm the facility if I don’t hear back!” Shime teased and Taisuke placed a kiss on the boy’s hair.</p><p>“Then I guess I have to make sure that you won’t get expelled for that.”</p><p>“Then don’t break your promise,” Shime whispered as he hugged his brother. The last hug he would ever give him…</p><p>The next time he saw his brother was a whole year later and there was absolutely nothing left of that smile he had wished to see again. But Shime had changed as well. A change which he had seen necessary to be able to even get close to his brother. As expected the promised contact had never come and soon after the disappearance of his brother the news of the Fallen had leaked. Shime had immediately known that his brother must have been among those Fallen or he would have come back to him. Unable to get anyone to help him, he tried for months to find Taisuke, but the Government started to hunt them and force them further away from the city. A civil war against the Fallen had started. First Shime had become a Chaser so that he could try and find Taisuke that way. But he soon realized that he wasn’t in any way suited to fight. At least not as a human. So as the Government suddenly established a new experiment and started sending out Vestige to the Centers against the Fallen he volunteered to become one of them.</p><p>On the same day as he had decided to become a Vestige he had met Matsuku who had made the same decision out of almost the same reasons.</p><p>Just two months after his transition Taisuke showed himself again, this time with a group of six followers. He hadn’t come to take the Main Center down, at least not yet. Maybe he wasn’t sure how strong he was himself at that time, but they could all only be grateful that he retreated or they would have all ended up dead.</p><p>Shime tried to stop his brother from running and now he was finally able to at least catch up with him, not that his strength was enough to stop him.</p><p>“Do you want to join us?” Taisuke’s question wasn’t as ridiculous as it should have sounded. What if he joined them? What if a Vestige went with the Fallen? Maybe he could find a better solution for all of them if he knew more about them?</p><p>“Won’t you come back with me instead?” Shime asked, trying to not sound too desperate. Yet the cold smile his brother showed made him tear up. How could he smile and yet be so emotionless? How could the touch on his face that followed, feel so meaningless.</p><p>“Oh, interesting. I can’t copy your special ability.”</p><p>“Maybe you just don’t want to,” Shime said, but what was he saying? His brother was a Fallen. There was nothing stopping him if he wanted to kill his own little brother now.</p><p>“I fear you won’t be of any use to us,” Taisuke said before he walked away from Shime, but once more he reached out for his older brother. What he didn’t expect was Taisuke turning and moving his hand to the boy’s chest. A common shockwave was what should usually hit him as in training Matsuku’s shockwave had hit him several times as well. But nothing happened and Taisuke lifted an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>“Interesting. Maybe you should join us after all. We could do a lot of research together.”</p><p>Shime shook his head and stepped back, not even having the mindset of using his immunity against Taisuke’s ability to attack his brother. “I wish I would have stopped you that day.”</p><p>“Oh boy, then I would be one of so many dead soldiers by now.”</p><p>“I might prefer that,” Shime let out, not even knowing how such cruel words left his mouth.</p><p>Taisuke seemed to get angry at his words, but before he could do anything, there were sirens heard from the Main Center and a lot of backup was on their way.</p><p>“Then maybe this should remain our last encounter. But be prepared, if you stay with the Government I won’t show you any mercy next time.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>Musen 27 - December</strong>
</p><p>“I remember that attack on the Main Center,” Kochi said after Taiga had come to the lab to show Kochi and Aran what Shime had shown him and Hokuto. He wasn’t able to go through all his memories at once and there were so many linked memories with the other boys that he needed to concentrate on the important parts for now.</p><p>“They told the other Centers to be on backup in case things escalate. They never gave us details about the Fallen who attacked though. But knowing that they had only shown up to scare the Government and make clear that they would be back with a real attack I wonder what the Main Center was thinking? The loss of so many lives at the East Center could have easily been prevented.”</p><p>“I wonder what would have happened if Myuto’s group had challenged Taisuke on their first encounter,” Taiga let out a bit absentminded.</p><p>“Most likely we would have all ended up dead,” Myuto was heard from the open lab door and Aran stood up, hurrying over to him.</p><p>“Are you alright? How are you feeling?”</p><p>“All good. I heard from Reo about Shime and the others. At least the summary.”</p><p>“I can give you the rest of the details,” Taiga offered and Myuto nodded before he lowered his hand from Aran’s cheek to take his hand and squeeze it.</p><p>“You should take a rest. I know you are worried, but you can’t lock yourself in the lab for days.”</p><p>“Could you stay out of my mind?” Aran teased, but of course he knew that the other one was worried and he definitely needed some sleep after they researched on the Reverse serum for this long. “Is Kentaro still asleep?”</p><p>Myuto nodded, but he wasn’t that worried. “Let’s talk to Yuma and the others for now.”</p><p>Aran nodded and left the lab first.</p><p>Myuto turned to Taiga after Aran had left. “You mind?”</p><p>Taiga nodded and stretched out his hand towards Myuto’s face. One part of Shime’s memory that surprised Myuto the same way as Taiga was that Taisuke seemed to completely remember everything from his life as a human. Was he that strong that he could easily deal with his past without his instincts trying to shut them out? For now they wouldn’t get to know.</p><p> It was so much faster to put memories into someone’s mind than talking things through, but Taiga still didn’t want to use this ability too much. It felt like there was still a lot about his own abilities he didn’t know. He felt that his abilities were the same as Myuto’s and if he wanted to he could actually block people’s memories and maybe even alter them, so that they would end up like Aran before. Something he never wanted to even try out.</p><p>***</p><p>“I wish I could take all the stress out of your mind.”</p><p>Hokuto’s words made Taiga turn to the boy who was lying with his back against the backrest with a few pillows behind his back, while Taiga had just sat down with an obvious way too loud sigh.</p><p>“Maybe Myuto could if I ask him?”</p><p>“But I doubt you would?”</p><p>And Hokuto was right, after all their abilities weren’t there to take away headaches or stress. But Taiga couldn’t deny that he felt extremely exhausted after this one day already and there was going to be a lot of chaos waiting for them that was for sure.</p><p>“Do you want to look further into Shime’s memories tomorrow?”</p><p>Taiga shook his head and crawled more onto the bed, resting his head on the other one’s chest as Hokuto invitingly stretched out his arm and played with Taiga’s hair now that he had settled down.</p><p>“I think tomorrow we should leave them all alone for a bit. Kentaro went straight to Yuma and the others when he woke up without even speaking to them and with Aran preparing the serum for them in the morning I think there will be enough chaos.”</p><p>“It fascinates me how they still follow Myuto even though his mind set is now so different,” Hokuto let out, his look absentmindedly on Taiga’s face.</p><p>“He is still as strong as before and they could have easily run over to Taisuke if they thought he was a more fitting leader.”</p><p>“Luckily that will be one less thing to worry about from tomorrow,” Hokuto said relieved and Taiga reached out for the other one’s hand and turned more on his back while he caressed the back of Hokuto’s hand.</p><p>“When you still had to deal with your Fallen self, did you ever feel how he was looking for a strong leader too?”</p><p>“You mean because he wanted to run over to Myuto?”</p><p>Taiga nodded while Hokuto’s hand stopped its movement in Taiga’s hair before he put on a thoughtful expression. “I never really felt his emotions in that way, so I am not sure if he was really looking for leadership or if he just wanted to break free from me.”</p><p>Taiga only nodded once more while both his hands were now putting a bit pressure on Hokuto’s hand and the boy raised an eyebrow at him. “Why did you want to know about this?”</p><p>“Mh? Oh, no specific reason. I think I am just worried that someone could still run over to Taisuke.”</p><p>“Like who? You?”</p><p>Taiga should laugh now, right? Yet he didn’t and Hokuto shifted a bit to be able to look at the other one more directly, but Taiga looked up at him and bit his lip. “That’s a joke, right? You got a serum, which should have actually turned you into a Vestige and just through my Fallen self you got his abilities. Your mind set is in no way the same as a Fallen.”</p><p>“Yet I am a Fallen, Kochi said so too.”</p><p>“And Myuto and the others are also still Fallen and they would never follow Taisuke. They almost died together with us fighting him. Is there something you aren’t telling me?”</p><p>Of course Hokuto would easily catch up with the situation and Taiga finally got up and sat down next to Hokuto, letting his head drop on the other one’s shoulder and luckily the younger one didn’t pull away. “I know I might just be overreacting, because I am so stressed and honestly quite scared about what Taisuke could do to our Center and the Government if he attacks with the Fallen following him.”</p><p>“But?” Hokuto asked, knowing that Taiga would never just start such a serious topic without any good reason.</p><p>“So much unused potential.”</p><p>Taiga’s words made Hokuto raise an eyebrow, but before he could shift away, Taiga hooked his arm with the other one. “Taisuke said that to me when he read my mind.”</p><p>“So what? You think there is still something going on in your mind? Don’t you think Kochi would have realized that by now? Even I couldn't find anything.”</p><p>“It does sound like I am overreacting, right?”</p><p>“It sounds damn scary,” Hokuto said to Taiga’s surprise and with the next move Hokuto placed a kiss on the other one’s hair and pulled him closer. “As long as you don’t hide anything from me or Kochi, I think you should be good? My Fallen self was able to communicate with me, so in case you ever feel like something is going on in your mind we can always run tests, you know? No matter how much our tests proved that you should be perfectly fine.”</p><p>Taiga was grateful that the other one didn’t make fun out of him over such a ridiculous worry, after all he wasn’t hiding anything. But his own weird reaction towards Taisuke on their first encounter and Taisuke’s words somehow made him worry that he wasn’t hiding something, but that something was hiding from him.</p>
