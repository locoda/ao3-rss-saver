      <p>“We have arrived, sir.”</p><p>Hokuto’s eyes flew open and for a moment, he was trapped – crushed under the weight of the earth, left gasping for air. His heart thrashed like a cornered canary and blood rushed to his ears. <i>Where the fuck was he?</i></p><p>Mentor. Side gig. Tutor. Rich family. Oh, right.</p><p>The pieces flashed in Hokuto’s mind in rapid succession, forming a story that had started weeks ago. He wasn't in danger, he had just fallen asleep in the back of a Mercedes, atop gleaming leather seats that appeared untouched. As if this Mercedes had been rolled out specifically for his journey. The driver opened the back door with little warning, jolting out the last bits of drowsiness from Hokuto. </p><p>So, he had arrived at the home of the Watanabe family.</p><p>“Thank you…” Hokuto trailed off, hoping the driver would fill in the burgeoning silence with his name. No such response came. He disguised his embarrassment with a cough and filed past. The driver wasted no time speeding away, but Hokuto barely noticed. He was too busy picking his (metaphorical) jaw up off the driveway.</p><p>His mentor had, of course, warned him of the Watanabes’ opulent lifestyle, forged by generations of family wealth that had only multiplied over the decades. Some said they possessed the Midas touch. Hokuto just assumed they were like all successful businessmen – shrewd, opportunistic, and willing to build their empire on the blood of the working class.</p><p>Their family home was living proof of it. Past the grand veranda, Hokuto could see acres of artfully landscaped lawns, manicured hedges, and fountains of marble. Trees that must have been centuries old yet too picturesque to have simply been incidentally there framed the property. The home itself was an architectural dream, all rustic pillars, romantic arches, and vintage stone. Fall leaves swirled in the driveway, left to the mercies of the gentle afternoon breeze. Hokuto took a deep breath, marveling at the quality of the air out here. His mentor had been right – the city had stifled him, he couldn’t breathe there anymore. He had to get away. Now, here he was. This was his <i>away.</i></p><p>Hokuto took in the scene before him one last time before tearing his eyes away from the grandeur of it all, lest he be caught ogling in the fancy high-tech security system he could vaguely make out on closer inspection. His mentor had lauded him to the Watanabes as an academic, after all. He had a reputation to uphold.</p><p>After ringing the bell – a surprisingly normal bell, he had half expected a live orchestra to announce his arrival – he was greeted by a woman, standing just past his shoulders, an inquisitive smile on her face.</p><p>The words Hokuto had prepared died on his lips – okay, he really had expected a butler to open the door.</p><p>“Good afternoon, you must be Mr. Matsumura,” her smile reached her eyes, Hokuto noted, she was the continuation of the autumn sunshine he had just witnessed outside. “I am Mina Watanabe. Please come in.”</p><p>He followed after her, his words may have withered away but hers flowed from her with ease, “I believe you spoke to mother about the arrangement with Ren. It is so nice to meet you, I have been hearing about you for weeks! You are all she can talk about. Your brilliant dissertations, articles, even poetry!”</p><p>She stopped abruptly and turned to face him, mirth flitting across her gentle features. Hokuto noticed she appeared around his age, early thirties, and was even more beautiful than he had originally thought. Dark hair, falling in soft waves, framed her warm eyes, her golden skin. “I barely know you and yet you are already like the older, more beloved brother I never had.”</p><p>“I’m… Sorry.” He whispered, not sure of what else to say.</p><p>She laughed in return, “No, don’t apologize. I am glad mother has found someone to adore half as much as Ren, you know.”</p><p>Mother – Sayuri Watanabe. She was the catalyst to all this, Hokuto supposed. An old friend of his mentor, she had been struggling to find the right tutor for her grandson. Emphasis on the right. A fastidious, downright unpleasant heiress, she had left more than one academic in tears after the first interview. They were all too slow, too clever, too quiet, too loud, too nosy, too aloof, too short, too tall for her. His mentor had finally suggested Hokuto take on the challenge and while every fiber of his being wanted to decline, he could not just turn down the woman he respected so much.</p><p>So, he met the surly, ill-tempered Sayuri Watanabe and she hired him that very day. In the following weeks, several letters would arrive from her daily, containing her fleeting thoughts, observations, and once, an arithmetic equation she wanted taught to her grandson, scribbled on a napkin that smelled of expensive eau de parfum. She read his works, no she <i>critiqued</i> his works – sometimes in English, but mostly in Latin, French, and languages Hokuto had never even seen. He was reaching for the dictionary more often and had recently given up entirely and downloaded Google Translate onto his ancient phone.</p><p>Sayuri Watanabe was eccentric, but Hokuto seemed not to mind as much as he thought he would. He would dutifully write back and their relationship evolved into that of penpals. An odd pair of penpals, he thought. A queer heiress and a could-barely-make-ends-meet professor on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Because that is where he had been – on the precipice of failure. The Dean of his university had made it abundantly clear that if things continued on course, Hokuto would not be asked to return to his seasonal position as Professor of the Classical Arts. He had gone home that night, chugged all the cheap wine left in his kitchen, and then proceeded to break all the glasses left in his kitchen. It had made the worst mess of his home and the ensuing hangover had been brutal, but it offered him some form of temporary release. And god knows he had needed that badly for years.</p><p>The days of shattered glasses and cheap wine were behind him now. He would spend the fall term tutoring an eight-year-old banking heir in his humble 10,000 square foot abode before the start of his winter term at a Swiss boarding school.</p><p>“You have a beautiful home, Mrs. Watanabe,” Hokuto finally chimed in.</p><p>Mina’s expression clouded so quick Hokuto startled, “Even my mother does not go by Mrs. Watanabe. Please, call me Mina.”</p><p>“I…” She was right – he would never dare call Sayuri Watanabe, Mrs. Watanabe. “I apologize. Mina. Call me Hokuto, as well."</p><p>And just as soon as the storm had arrived, it vanished. It felt familiar somehow, this dance. Mina was all smiles as she toured him across the home, through the spacious main living room with an exquisite grand piano centerpiece, a kitchen that put most industrial ones to shame, and a dining room that was far too perfectly staged to ever truly have been used. They paused at the base of the grand staircase. To be honest, Hokuto was winded from all the striding about – rich people needed to fit, he concluded, if the walk from one end of the kitchen to the other was going to take several minutes.</p><p>“Your quarters will be on the upper floor, just to the left. I had it fitted to your requirements, even brought over the books my mother would like you to read over the term. I know, she can be infuriatingly rigid with her expectations.” On that point, Hokuto could agree with Mina. If Sayuri was almost unbearable as a peer, Hokuto pitied the woman before him for being born her only daughter.</p><p>Before Mina could continue, a resoundingly chirpy voice called out, “mother!” and Hokuto had barely any time to assess the situation before a small creature launched itself into her arms.</p><p>Mina laughed, arms wrapping around what Hokuto could now confirm was a boy. Of approximately eight years of age. The illustrious grandson, he presumed, Ren.</p><p>He stood awkwardly at the side as mother and son reunited. Before long, Ren’s curious gaze turned to him.</p><p>“Hello,” Hokuto waved, deciding it was the right thing to do.<br/>
~</p><p>They settled in quickly after introductions. As it turned out, Ren was as naturally amiable to unfamiliar people as his mother was. Bright, inquisitive, and brimming with endless questions, it appeared that Hokuto had already started tutoring a day ahead of schedule.</p><p>Mina grinned as she appeared in the doorway of Ren’s room watching from afar as her child forced Hokuto to explain Newton’s laws and falling apples and the link between them. Hokuto could barely keep up, but he enjoyed how occupied he felt at the moment. It was better than being left caged with his own thoughts. This was exactly what he <i>needed.</i> After everything that had happened.</p><p>“Mina, darling, I was looking all over for you. Has Ren arrived?” A figure appeared in the doorway, moving to stand beside Mina and Hokuto had only a moment to register the voice – that painfully familiar voice he would know even in death – before their eyes locked. His heart sank, into the deepest of pits, his throat suddenly parched. This could not be fucking real.</p><p>Before him stood the source of his sleepless nights, the root of his downfall, the need for his escape, his tormentor himself. <i>Taiga Kyomoto.</i></p><p>Mina was too busy responding to her husband to note the way Hokuto visibly blanched.</p><p>“He got in just now.”</p><p>“I see.” Taiga’s eyes never left his. There was hesitation there, so fleeting Hokuto may have imagined it, before a coldness settled in. This was the Taiga he had last known, anyways, hard and unyielding. Ruthless.</p><p>Mina finally caught up to the eye contact game played between her husband and son’s tutor.</p><p>“Do you two know each other?”</p><p>Taiga didn’t miss a beat, “Of course not. But, I assume he is the new tutor. Matsumura.” Each word felt like a nail being driven into him.</p><p>He had known Taiga the longest out of anyone in this room, after all. Knew him as the purposefully reckless teenager, then the overly cautious young adult. He knew every cadence of his tone, every microexpression he put on to serve his calculated facade. And right now the full arsenal of his malice was directed at Hokuto, the man he had once proclaimed to love forever.</p><p>Hokuto flinched as Taiga bent down in front of him, reaching eye level. He offered a hand and Hokuto hated himself for noticing the silver wedding band, resting perfectly on his ring finger, “It is nice to make your acquaintance.”</p>
